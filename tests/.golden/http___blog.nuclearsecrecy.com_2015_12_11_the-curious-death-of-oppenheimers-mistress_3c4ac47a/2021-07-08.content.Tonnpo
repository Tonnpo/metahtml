<h2 class="rm-manual">The curious death of Oppenheimer’s mistress</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"> by Alex Wellerstein, published December 11th, 2015 </p>
<p>The most recent episode of <a href="http://wgnamerica.com/series/manhattan">Manhattan</a>,
 209, is the penultimate episode for Season 2. There were many aspects 
that pleased me a lot, in part because I saw my own fingerprints on 
them: the discussion between Frank and Charlie about the possibility of a
 <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/03/06/to-demonstrate-or-not-to-demonstrate/">demonstration</a>,
 and Charlie’s later coming around to the idea that the best thing you 
could do for the future was to make the use of the first atomic bombs 
usage <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/08/06/429433621/why-did-the-u-s-choose-hiroshima">as terrible as possible</a>; the full-circling of the subplot involving the <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/03/15/death-of-a-patent-clerk/">patent clerk</a>; the tricky politics of the <a href="http://www.dannen.com/decision/targets.html">Target Committee</a>.
 But my favorite part was that the Jean Tatlock subplot finally paid 
off. The idea that Jean Tatlock might have been murdered by intelligence
 agents working for Manhattan Project security sounds like a crazy 
conspiracy theory, a totally imaginative take by the writers of the 
show. But there’s potentially more to it than just that.</p>
<p>Three photographs of Jean Tatlock. The one at left and right come from <a href="http://atomiclovestory.com/">the website</a> of Shirley Streshinsky and Patricia Klaus’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1618580191/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1618580191&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=restrdata-20&amp;linkId=OWODCEEJ5TEA4H5V">An Atomic Love Story</a>, a book about Oppenheimer’s loves; the one in the middle comes from Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375726268/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0375726268&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=restrdata-20&amp;linkId=OGKQOV3UPDMJDBSY">American Prometheus</a>.</p>
<p>Jean Tatlock is an interesting and curious character. In most 
narratives about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, she shows up with 
two purposes: to radicalize him, and to humanize him. He put his 
relationship this way in his <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/01/09/oppenheimer-unredacted-part-i/">security hearing of 1954</a>:</p>
<p>In the spring of 1936, I had been introduced by friends to Jean 
Tatlock, the daughter of a noted professor of English at the university;
 and in the autumn, I began to court her, and we grew close to each 
other. We were at least twice close enough to marriage to think of 
ourselves as engaged. Between 1939 and her death in 1944 I saw her very 
rarely. She told me about her Communist Party memberships; they were on 
again, off again affairs, and never seemed to provide for her what she 
was seeking. I do not believe that her interests were really political. 
She loved this country and its people and its life. She was, as it 
turned out, a friend of many fellow travelers and Communists, with a 
number of whom I was later to become acquainted.</p>
<p>I should not give the impression that it was wholly because of Jean 
Tatlock that I made leftwing friends, or felt sympathy for causes which 
hitherto would have seemed so remote from me, like the Loyalist cause in
 Spain, and the organization of migratory workers. I have mentioned some
 of the other contributing causes. I liked the new sense of 
companionship, and at the time felt that I was coming to be part of the 
life of my time and country.</p>
<p>One, of course, doesn’t take such a statement fully at face value, 
being made, as it was, ten years after her death, and in the middle of a
 hearing on whether Oppenheimer himself was loyal to the country. It is 
an interesting fact, as an aside, that it was Tatlock who broke off the 
official relationship, in 1939, rejecting an offer of marriage. He got 
seriously involved with Katharine (Kitty), his future wife, a few months
 later.</p>
<p>Tatlock’s name pops up in the Oppenheimer security hearing a number 
of times, and proved a rather tricky, if not embarrassing, issue for 
Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer admitted that he had visited Tatlock in San 
Francisco in June of 1943. It was a secret visit, approved by nobody, at
 the time when Oppenheimer was director of Los Alamos. Oppenheimer was 
being tailed by intelligence agents during the entire trip, however. A 
few choice selections from the transcript:</p>
<p>Oppenheimer: I visited Jean Tatlock in the spring of 1943. I almost 
had to. She was not much of a communist but she was certainly a member 
of the party. There was nothing dangerous about that. There was nothing 
potentially dangerous about that. …</p>
<p>Q: Doctor, between 1939 and 1944, as I understand it, your acquaintance with Miss Tatlock was fairly casual, is that right?</p>
<p>JRO: Our meetings were rare. I do not think it would be right to say 
our acquaintance was casual. We had been very much involved with one 
another and there was still very deep feeling when we saw each other. … I
 visited her, as I think I said earlier, in June or July of 1943.</p>
<p>Q: I believe you said in connection with that that you had to see her.</p>
<p>JRO: Yes. </p>
<p>Q: Why did you have to see her?</p>
<p>JRO: She had indicated a great desire to see me before we left [for 
Los Alamos]. At that time I couldn’t go. For one thing, I wasn’t 
supposed to say where we were going or anything. I felt that she had to 
see me. She was undergoing psychiatric treatment. She was extremely 
unhappy. </p>
<p>Q: Did you find out why she had to see you?</p>
<p>JRO: Because she was still in love with me.</p>
<p>Q: Where did you see her?</p>
<p>JRO: At her home. …</p>
<p>Q: You spent the night with her, didn’t you?</p>
<p>JRO: Yes. </p>
<p>Q: That was when you were working on a secret war project?</p>
<p>JRO: Yes.</p>
<p>Q: Did you think that consistent with good security?</p>
<p>JRO: It was as a matter of fact. Not a word — it was not good practice.</p>
<p>All of the above was discussed at the security hearing with Kitty present in the room. Ouch.</p>
<p>Later, they asked Lt. Col. John Lansdale, Jr., the head of Manhattan Project security, about Tatlock and Oppenheimer:</p>
<p>Q: You had no doubt, did you, that Jean Tatlock was a communist?</p>
<p>Lansdale: She was certainly on our suspect list. I know now that she 
was a communist. I cannot recall at the moment whether we were sure she 
was a communist at the time.</p>
<p>Q: Did your definition of very good discretion include spending the night with a known communist woman?</p>
<p>L: No, it didn’t. Our impression was that interest was more romantic than otherwise, and it is the sole instance that I know of.</p>
<p>Tatlock, according to the standard version of the story, suffered 
from intense depression and killed herself in January 1944. Her love of 
John Donne may have been why Oppenheimer named the first test for the 
atomic bomb “Trinity.” We don’t know; even Oppenheimer claimed not to 
know. It makes for a good story as it is, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-first-light-of-the-trinity-atomic-test">a poetic humanization of a weapons physicist and the first atomic test</a>.
 Peer De Silva, the head of security for the Los Alamos laboratory, 
later wrote that he was the one who told Oppenheimer of Tatlock’s death,
 and that he wept: “[Oppenheimer] went on at considerable length about 
the depth of his emotion for Jean, saying there was really no one else 
to whom he could speak.”<a href="#footnote_0_6099">1</a></p>
<p>But there may be more to the story. Gregg Herken’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080506589X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=080506589X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=restrdata-20&amp;linkId=PMAN4E5PP2NZHCA2">Brotherhood of the Bomb</a>
 (Henry Holt, 2002) was the first source I saw that really peeled apart 
the Oppenheimer-Tatlock story, and got into the details of the 1943 
visit. Oppenheimer had told security he was visiting Berkeley to recruit
 an assistant, though Tatlock was always the real reason for the trip. 
He was being tailed by G-2 agents the entire time, working for Boris 
Pash, who was in charge of Army counterintelligence in the Bay Area. 
They tailed Oppenheimer and Tatlock to dinner (Mexican food), and then 
followed them back to Tatlock’s house. Army agents sat in a car across 
the street the entire night. The assistant that Oppenheimer hired was 
David Hawkins, who had his own Communist sympathies. The whole thing was
 a very dodgy affair (in many senses of the term) for the scientific 
head of the bomb project. Pash subsequently got permission to put an FBI
 bug on Tatlock’s phone.<a href="#footnote_1_6099">2</a></p>

<p>More recently, and more sensationally, there is an entire chapter on 
Tatlock’s death in Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s biography of 
Oppenheimer, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375726268/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0375726268&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=restrdata-20&amp;linkId=OGKQOV3UPDMJDBSY">American Prometheus</a>
 (Knopf, 2005). They suggest that there is evidence that Tatlock’s death
 might not have been a suicide at all — that it might have been an 
assassination, murder. Now, just to make sure we are clear, they go to 
lengths to suggest that the evidence is not clear, and that their 
argument is speculative and circumstantial. But I also want to point out
 that Bird and Sherwin aren’t cranks: I know them both personally and 
professionally, and they are serious about their craft and research, and
 the chapter on Tatlock’s death, like the others in their book, is 
meticulously documented. The book itself won the Pulitzer Prize, as 
well. So this is not something that should be easily dismissed.</p>
<p>Bird and Sherwin paint a messy picture. Tatlock’s father discovered 
her dead, having broken into her apartment after a day of not being able
 to reach her. He found her “lying on a pile of pillows at the end of 
the bathtub, with her head submerged in the partly filled tub.” He found
 her suicide note, which read: “I am disgusted with everything… To those
 who loved me and helped me, all love and courage. I wanted to live and 
to give and I got paralyzed somehow. I tried like hell to understand and
 couldn’t… I think I would have been a liability all my life—at least I 
could take away the burden of a paralyzed soul from a fighting world.”</p>
<p>John Tatlock moved her body to the sofa, rummaged through the 
apartment to find her correspondence, and burnt it in the fireplace. He 
spent hours in the apartment before calling the funeral parlor, and it 
was the funeral parlor who called the police. The cause of death was 
drowning. To quote from Bird and Sherwin directly:</p>
<p>According to the coroner, Tatlock had eaten a full meal shortly 
before her death. If it was her intention to drug and then drown 
herself, as a doctor she had to have known that undigested food slows 
the metabolizing of drugs into the system. The autopsy report contains 
no evidence that the barbiturates had reached her liver or other vital 
organs. Neither does the report indicate whether she had taken a 
sufficiently large dose of barbiturates to cause death. To the contrary,
 as previously noted, the autopsy determined that the cause of death was
 asphyxiation by drowning. These curious circumstances are suspicious 
enough—but the disturbing information contained in the autopsy report is
 the assertion that the coroner found “a faint trace of chloral hydrate”
 in her system. If administered with alcohol, chloral hydrate is the 
active ingredient of what was then commonly called a “Mickey 
Finn”—knockout drops. In short, several investigators have speculated, 
Jean may have been “slipped a Mickey,” and then forcibly drowned in her 
bathtub.</p>
<p>The coroner’s report indicated that no alcohol was found in her 
blood. (The coroner, however, did find some pancreatic damage, 
indicating that Tatlock had been a heavy drinker.) Medical doctors who 
have studied suicides—and read the Tatlock autopsy report—say that it is
 possible she drowned herself. In this scenario, Tatlock could have 
eaten a last meal with some barbiturates to make herself sleepy and then
 self-administered chloral hydrate to knock herself out while kneeling 
over the bathtub. If the dose of chloral hydrate was large enough, 
Tatlock could have plunged her head into the bathtub water and never 
revived. She then would have died from asphyxiation. Tatlock’s 
“psychological autopsy” fits the profile of a high-functioning 
individual suffering from “retarded depression.” As a psychiatrist 
working in a hospital, Jean had easy access to potent sedatives, 
including chloral hydrate. On the other hand, said one doctor shown the 
Tatlock records, “If you were clever and wanted to kill someone, this is
 the way to do it.”<a href="#footnote_2_6099">3</a></p>
<p>Interesting — but not in any way conclusive. What becomes more 
suspicious is when you look a bit more at the person who might have been
 most interested in Tatlock being “removed from the picture”: Lt. Col. 
Boris Pash, chief of the Counterintelligence Branch of the Western 
Defense Command (Army G-2 counterintelligence). A Russian immigrant to 
the United States who had fought on the losing side of the Russian Civil
 War, Pash was regarded by fellow Russian émigré George Kistiakowsky as 
“a really wild Russian, an extreme right wing, sort of Ku Klux Klan 
enthusiast.”<a href="#footnote_3_6099">4</a></p>

<p>Aside from bugging Tatlock’s apartment, Pash attempted to get 
Oppenheimer fired as a potential spy, during the war. He worried that 
even if Oppenheimer wasn’t himself spying, he might be setting up people
 within his organization (like Hawkins) who could be spies, with Tatlock
 as the conduit. He was overruled by Lansdale and Groves, both of whom 
trusted Oppenheimer. Pash would later be given the job of being the 
military head of the <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/11/13/when-did-the-allies-know-there-wasnt-a-german-bomb/">Alsos mission</a> — to better to harass German atomic scientists rather than American ones? <a href="#footnote_4_6099">5</a></p>
<p>In his memos about Oppenheimer and Tatlock, Pash comes off as 
fearful, hyperbolic, and hyperventilating. He did not see this as a 
matter of idle suspicion, but intense danger. After his recommendations 
were ignored, could he have taken things into his own hands? It’s a big 
claim. What seems to give it the whiff of credence is what Pash did 
after the war. In the mid-1970s, during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee">Church Committee</a>
 hearings about the mis-deeds of the CIA, it came out that from 1949 
through 1952, Pash was Chief of Program Branch 7 — which was responsible
 for assassinations, kidnappings, and other “special operations,” but 
apparently did not perform any.<a href="#footnote_5_6099">6</a></p>
<p>Could Pash, or someone working for him, have killed Tatlock? Probably
 not Pash himself: in November 1943 (two months before Tatlock’s death),
 he was already in Europe organizing the Alsos mission. The records 
indicate that in late December 1943 through mid-January 1944, Pash was 
in Italy. It’s not very plausible that he’d have raced back to San 
Francisco for a “side mission” of this sort.<a href="#footnote_6_6099">7</a>
 Would someone else in G-2, or the Manhattan Project intelligence 
services, be willing and capable of doing such a thing? We don’t know.</p>
<p>Might Tatlock’s death just really have been what it appeared to be at
 first glance — a suicide? Of course. Bird and Sherwin conclude that 
there just isn’t enough evidence to think anything else with any 
certainty. What does it do to our narrative, if we assume Tatlock’s 
death was not a suicide? It further emphasizes that those working on the
 bomb were playing at a very dangerous game, with extremely high stakes,
 and that extraordinary measures might have been taken. The number of 
lives on the line, present and future, could seem staggeringly large. 
Just because it makes for a good story, of course, doesn’t make it true.
 But from a narrative standpoint, it does make for a nice area of 
historical ambiguity — just the kind of thing that a fictional, 
alternate-reality version of the bomb project, like Manhattan, is 
designed to explore.</p>

<li>Bird and Sherwin, chapter 16. Separately, in an executive (Top 
Secret) hearing before the Church Committee in 1975, Pash disputed that 
he was ever an employee of the CIA (“I was never an employee of the 
Agency. I was detailed from the Army for a normal tour of duty to the 
Agency.”) and that the unit he was part of “was not an assassination 
unit.” In the same testimony he did, however, emphasize how rag-tag 
American counterintelligence was during World War II, having called up a
 lot of reserve units like himself — he was a schoolteacher originally —
 sending them briefly to have training with the FBI, and then sending 
them out into the field extremely fresh. On the early CIA, Pash said: 
“So, when the CIA was formed, a lot of those people with these wild 
ideas and wild approaches were there. So of course when you say you’re 
in charge of all other activities in individual activities, and these 
fellows might have ideas well, you know, like we did maybe in World War 
II, I heard they did something like that, well, it’s easier to kill a 
guy than to worry about trailing him, you see. So maybe that is where 
something originated.” (The not-entirely-clear phrasing is in the 
original transcript.) He went on to say that at one point an idea of 
assassination was floated when he was conveniently out of town, but that
 his office had rejected it. The testimony is not entirely clear on 
timing issues, and Pash goes out of his way to emphasize his lack of 
memory from the period, urging that his time with the CIA was mostly 
spent planning operations, but not actually carrying them out. <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1976-Executive-Session-Pash-testimony-on-assassination.pdf">Testimony
 of Boris T. Pash at an Executive Hearing of the Select Senate Study of 
Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities</a> (7 
January 1976). As with all of this kind of spy stuff, it can be very 
hard to sort out who is telling the truth. There are motives upon 
motives for giving inaccurate portrayals of things in one direction or 
the other. Many of the allegations against the CIA and Pash came 
originally from E. Howard Hunt, who is a character of some impressive 
slipperiness. Pash emphatically denied most of what Hunt said, and 
insinuated that it might be part of a disinformation campaign, or 
something Hunt was doing for personal profit. Hunt, in his own executive
 session testimony, said that Pash himself had a reputation for 
kidnappings when he worked in the CIA, not assassinations. 
Interestingly, Hunt told the committee that the reason he had remembered
 Pash’s name, all those years later, was because he had been reading 
Nuel Pharr Davis’ book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671410687/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0671410687&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=restrdata-20&amp;linkId=KZJ36F4KP56JZPO6">Lawrence and Oppenheimer</a>
 (Simon and Schuster, 1968) — which strikes me as a bit meta, having 
walked down this rabbit hole from another Oppenheimer biography. 
Confronted with Pash’s denial, Hunt equivocated a bit, not calling Pash a
 liar, but suggesting that some of what he heard about Pash might not be
 entirely accurate, but sticking to the basics. It makes for an 
interesting read. Testimony of E. Howard Hunt at an <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1976-Executive-Session-Hunt-testimony-on-Pash.pdf">Executive Hearing of the Select Senate Study of Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities</a>
 (10 January 1976). The Church Committee staff concluded that while 
Pash’s group may have had assassinations and kidnappings as part of its 
responsibility, it performed none of them and did not plan any.

 is obvious that you put a lot of time and effort into this. I 
appreciate it. What’s the process you use to locate these kinds of 
documents, seems like reading the books and footnotes? Have you ever 
gone and watched these microfilms?</p><p class="rm-manual"> Thanks again and have a good weekend</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/" rel="external nofollow ugc">Alex Wellerstein</a> <span>says:</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/12/11/the-curious-death-of-oppenheimers-mistress/#comment-228475">December 12, 2015 at 10:01 am</a> </p> <p class="rm-manual">Books,
 footnotes, original documents in archives, microfilms, FOIA requests,

 and Oppenheimer seem to be birds of a feather, neurotic and sociopathic
 at a high level. Each probably had numerous liaisons/affairs, and their
 risk-taking behaviors must have driven the counterintelligence guys

Branch Jr.</a> <span>says:</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/12/11/the-curious-death-of-oppenheimers-mistress/#comment-228480">December 12, 2015 at 4:56 pm</a> </p> <p class="rm-manual">Did
 Jean Tatlock kill herself, or was her death brought about by someone 
else? This looks like an either/or question, but sometimes in situations
 like this, a both-and answer is possible. In reading Henry James’s 
story “The Turn of the Screw,” for instance, one is likely to suppose 
either that the governess is crazy, or that the ghosts are real, but as a
 teacher of mine once pointed out, both may be true.</p> <p class="rm-manual">In
 the case of Jean Tatlock, it’s likely that appearances are correct and 
that she did kill herself, but then there are those telltale bits of 
evidence and argument that may allow you to believe she was killed and 
the result staged to mislead investigators. Suicide is certainly 
plausible, but in a way the murder theory is too. It’s rather hard to 
imagine drowning yourself in a tub, even with the calculated help of 
chloral hydrate, which I’d think would be hard to get right on the first
 try. Although Virginia Woolf apparently managed to calmly walk into a 
river, this kind of deliberate drowning is rare, to judge from my 
research into suicide. And yet Tatlock’s note sounds authentic, speaking
 in a voice of regret and pain and self-recrimination. Who could’ve 
forged such a thing?</p> <p class="rm-manual">What’s really interesting,
 though, at least from a dramatic point of view, is the both-and 
possibility: maybe Tatlock did kill herself, but under the influence of 
an outside party. Boris Pash doesn’t sound capable of such persuasion, 
and besides he seems to have been elsewhere at the time, but maybe 
someone else could’ve done it.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I hope I haven’t
 gone overboard or sounded cavalier in anything I’ve said. Suicide and 
murder are horrible to contemplate, just as the deaths at Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki are, but the grim extremity of such things is part of what 
drives the investigations of history and the dramatizations of fiction.</p> </li> </ol>
