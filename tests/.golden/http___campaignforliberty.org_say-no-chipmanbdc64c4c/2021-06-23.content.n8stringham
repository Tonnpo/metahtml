<h1 class="rm-manual">Say "no" to Chipman</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> POSTED BY <a href="file:///author/jm_admin">John McCardell</a> <a>June 14, 2021</a> </p>
<p>Despite all the well-documented baggage he has, anti-gun zealot and 
leader of the Waco raid David Chipman, and now President Biden’s pick to
 lead the ATF, will be voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee on 
Thursday, June 17.</p>
<p>Could they have made a worse pick for the person to head up the ATF?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.chooseliberty.org/david-chipman-do-not-confirm/?source_code=cblog">Sign the petition to your U.S. Senators demanding they vote AGAINST David Chipman’s confirmation.</a></p>
<p>After you sign, I strongly urge you to forward the petition link to a friend.</p>
<p>David Chipman said during his hearing in the Senate last month that any law-abiding gun owner is a potential criminal.</p>
<p>Did he forget the definition of “law-abiding?”</p>
<p>Chipman’s record is clearly anti-Second Amendment. And we can't 
ignore his involvement in Waco, where adults and children were 
tragically killed due to the actions of the federal government.</p>
<p>It’s not a familiar name to many, but Chipman’s role in one of the 
worst tragedies involving the U.S. government killing citizens on our 
soil cannot be denied.</p>
<p>He certainly doesn’t deny it.</p>
<p>While he was an agent for the ATF, Chipman was stationed in Waco, TX 
from 1993 to 1998 and was pictured in front of the aftermath of the 
assault on the Branch Davidian compound. After a 51-day standoff with 
the members of the compound in February of 1993, the compound was raided
 by a combination of federal agents from the FBI, ATF, and local law 
enforcement.</p>
<p>The Branch Davidians were suspected of possessing “illegal weapons.”</p>
<p>Chipman later claimed that the Branch Davidians had shot down 
helicopters with those weapons, a claim which was completely refuted by a
 U.S. House of Representatives’ report.</p>
<p>The end result after the standoff, teargassing, and gun fights 
instigated by the ATF was 4 dead federal agents and 78 members of the 
Branch Davidians, <span>including 25 children who were killed in the fires that engulfed the compound.</span></p>
<p>To this day, the ATF commemorates Waco and the agents who died without acknowledging the horrible tragedy of all the <span>innocent children who were killed</span> in the raid that followed.</p>
<p>And now Joe Biden thinks the best way to recreate that kind of 
“success” would be to put that same agent who was stationed in Waco, in 
charge of the entire ATF.</p>
<p>Chipman does not belong anywhere near a position of power over our right to defend ourselves. <a href="https://www.chooseliberty.org/david-chipman-do-not-confirm/?source_code=cblog">Sign your petition now</a>.</p>
