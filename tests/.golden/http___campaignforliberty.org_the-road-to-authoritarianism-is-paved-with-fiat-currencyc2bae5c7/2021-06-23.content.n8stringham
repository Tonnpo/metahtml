<h1 class="rm-manual">The Road to Authoritarianism is Paved with Fiat Currency</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> POSTED BY <a href="file:///author/rp_admin">Ron Paul</a> <a>June 21, 2021</a> </p>
<p>Last week, the Federal Reserve announced it will maintain an interest
 rate target of zero to 0.25 percent for the rest of 2021. The Fed said 
it will also continue its monthly purchase of 120 billion dollars of 
Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>Some Fed board members are forecasting a rate increase by late 2022 
or 2023, though with the rate still not reaching one percent. The Fed 
will neither allow interest rates to rise to market levels nor reduce 
its purchase of Treasury securities. A significant increase in interest 
rates would make the government’s borrowing costs unsustainable.</p>
<p>The Fed also raised its projected rate of inflation to three percent,
 although it still insists the rise in prices is a transitory effect of 
the end of the lockdowns. There is some truth to this, as it will take 
some time for businesses to get back to full capacity. However, the Fed 
began taking extraordinary measures to prop up the economy in September 
of 2019, when it started pumping billions of dollars a day into the repo
 market that banks use to make short-term loans to each other. The 
lockdowns only postponed and deepened the forthcoming Fed-caused 
meltdown.</p>
<p>Germany’s Deutsche Bank recently released a paper warning about the 
Federal Reserve continuing to disregard the inflation risk caused by 
easy money policies designed to “stimulate” the economy and facilitate 
massive government spending. Germans have reason to be sensitive to the 
consequences of inflation, including hyperinflation. Out-of-control 
inflation played a major role in the collapse of the German economy in 
the 1920s, which led to the rise of the National Socialists.</p>
<p>This pattern could repeat itself in America where we have already 
witnessed the rise of authoritarian movements. Last summer, groups 
exploited legitimate concerns about police misconduct to ferment 
violence across the country. Can anyone doubt that an economic crisis 
that leads to mass unemployment, foreclosures, and maybe even shortages 
will result in large-scale violence? Or that the violence will be 
exploited by power-hungry politicians? Or that many people will once 
again fall for the big lie that preserving safety requires giving up 
their liberty?</p>
<p>The apparatus of repression already exists in the form of a 
surveillance state, police militarization, and big tech’s cooperation 
with big government to stamp out dissent. Now, President Biden and his 
congressional allies want to use the January 6 US Capitol turmoil to 
justify expanding government powers in the name of stopping “domestic 
terrorists.” Part of this new campaign is expanding censorship of 
“extremism,” defined as any views that threaten the status quo. The 
Biden administration has taken a page from the Communist playbook in 
suggesting people report their friends and family who are becoming 
“radicalized.”</p>
<p>We may still have time to prevent collapse in America, or at least to
 make sure the collapse leads to a transition to a free society. The key
 to success is spreading the ideas of liberty until we have the ability 
to force the politicians to dismantle the welfare-warfare state and the 
fiat money system that is the lifeblood of authoritarian government.</p>
