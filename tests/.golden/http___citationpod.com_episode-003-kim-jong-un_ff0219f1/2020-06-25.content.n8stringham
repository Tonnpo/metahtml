 Little is known for certain about Kim Jong-un. Before taking power, he 
had barely been seen in public, and many of the activities of both Kim 
and his government remain shrouded in secrecy.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un#cite_note-8">[7]</a>
 Even details such as what year he was born, and whether he did indeed 
attend a Western school under a pseudonym, are difficult to confirm with
 certainty.</p>
<p>Kim was officially declared the supreme leader following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Kim_Jong-il">state funeral of his father</a> on 28 December 2011. Kim holds the titles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Workers%27_Party_of_Korea">Chairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea</a>, Chairman of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Military_Commission_(DPRK)">Central Military Commission</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_National_Defence_Commission">Chairman of the National Defence Commission</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander_of_the_Korean_People%27s_Army">Supreme Commander of the Korean People’s Army</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un#cite_note-AFP2011-1">[1]</a> and presidium member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_Standing_Committee_of_the_Workers%27_Party_of_Korea">Politburo Standing Committee</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_Korea">Workers’ Party of Korea</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un#cite_note-9">[8]</a></p>
<p>Kim was promoted to the rank of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonsu">Marshal</a> of North Korea in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Army">Korean People’s Army</a> on 18 July 2012, consolidating his position as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un#cite_note-marshall-10">[9]</a> and is often referred to as Marshal Kim Jong-un or “the Marshal” by state media.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un#cite_note-11">[10]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un#cite_note-12">[11]</a></p>
<p>Kim obtained two degrees, one in physics at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung_University">Kim Il-sung University</a>, and another as an Army officer at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung_Military_University">Kim Il-sung Military University</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un#cite_note-13">[12]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un#cite_note-Powell2011-14">[13]</a></p>
<p>On 12 December 2013 official North Korean news outlets released 
reports that due to alleged “treachery,” he had ordered the execution of
 his uncle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jang_Song-thaek">Jang Song-thaek</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un#cite_note-15">[14]</a> On 9 March 2014, Kim Jong-un was elected unopposed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_People%27s_Assembly">Supreme People’s Assembly</a>.
 He is the first North Korean leader born after the country’s founding. 
Kim Jong-un is widely believed to have ordered the assassination of his 
brother, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-nam">Kim Jong-nam</a> in Malaysia in February 2017.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un#cite_note-16">[15]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un#cite_note-delusional-17">[16]</a></p>
