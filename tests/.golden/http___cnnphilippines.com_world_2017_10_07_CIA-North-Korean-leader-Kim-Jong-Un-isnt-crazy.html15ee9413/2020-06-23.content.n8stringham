Trump's remarks to the UN threatening the country reflect "mentally 
deranged behavior," according to a statement released by North Korea's 
news agency, KCNA. Kim Jong Un is seen her during military drills in

<p>(CNN) â€” Between the ruthless executions of his own senior officers, 
bombastic threats of nuclear annihilation and defiant missile tests, it 
may be easy to agree with President Donald Trump's recent assessment 
that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a "madman" who is "on a suicide 
mission for himself."</p>
<p>But top officials from the CIA said Wednesday that Kim's actions are 
not those of a maniacal provocateur but a "rational actor" who is 
motivated by clear, long-term goals that revolve around ensuring regime 
survival.</p>
<p>"There's a clarity of purpose in what Kim Jong Un has done," 
according to Yong Suk Lee, deputy assistant director of the CIA's Korea 
Mission Center, who discussed the escalating tensions between North 
Korea and the US during a conference organized by the agency at George 
Washington University.</p>
<p>"Waking up one morning and deciding he wants to nuke" Los Angeles is 
not something Kim Jong Un is likely to do, Lee said. "He wants to rule 
for a long time and die peacefully in his own bed."</p>
<p>And for CIA officers, diplomats and lawmakers tasked with utilizing 
intelligence to protect the US and its allies from the security threats 
posed by North Korea, understanding that purpose could prove to be key 
in avoiding a potentially devastating military conflict.</p>
<p>Mixed messaging</p>
<p>US-led efforts to apply additional diplomatic pressure on North Korea
 in recent months have been met with greater defiance as the Kim regime 
continues to march toward realizing its nuclear ambitions.</p>
<p>Despite assurances from Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary 
of State Rex Tillerson that the US continues to seek a peaceful 
resolution, neither side has overtly indicated that it is ready or 
willing to engage in serious negotiations.</p>
<p>The mixed-messages coming from the Trump administration also continue to raise questions about the US approach to North Korea.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly undercut comments made by his top officials and 
publicly engaged in a war of words with Kim that has devolved into 
insults and name-calling -- only raising fears of an eventual military 
conflict.</p>
<p>"When they hear what's coming from the President, I think it 
resonates with them," said Ambassador Joseph R. DeTrani, who previously 
served at the Department of State as the Special Envoy for Six-Party 
Talks with North Korea.</p>
<p>"But they also know we have a process and I think right now they're probing," he said.</p>
<p>Trump said Thursday the US will "do what we must do" to prevent further threats from North Korea.</p>
<p>"We cannot allow this dictatorship to threaten our nation or our 
allies with unimaginable loss of life," he said at a meeting with top 
military officers.</p>
<p>"We will do what we must do to prevent that from happening and it will be done if necessary, believe me."</p>
<p>But while Trump continues to publicly paint Kim as an irrational 
dictator, CIA officials said the intelligence community views the North 
Korean leader's actions through a different lens.</p>
<p>"The last person who wants conflict on the peninsula is actually Kim 
Jong Un," Lee said. "We have a tendency in this country and elsewhere to
 underestimate the conservatism that runs in these authoritarian 
regimes."</p>
<p>Ruthless purges</p>
<p>While Kim may not want a war with the US, he does view the strategy 
of perpetuating a confrontational relationship as a key to maintaining 
his grip on power, according to Lee and Michael Collins, deputy 
assistant director of the east Asia and Pacific mission center at the 
CIA.</p>
<p>"North Korea is a political organism that thrives on confrontation," Lee said.</p>
<p>Since succeeding his father in 2011, Kim's rise from political novice
 to adept operator has stemmed from a calculated commitment to 
consolidating power within his own regime and transforming North Korea 
into a nuclear state.</p>
<p>Internally, Kim has demonstrated a willingness to purge those who might pose a threat to his rule.</p>
<p>One report from a South Korean think tank, the Institute for National
 Security Strategy, claims he has ordered the executions of at least 340
 people since he came to power -- 140 of whom were senior officers in 
the country's government, military and ruling Korean Worker's Party.</p>
<p>In 2013 he executed his own uncle, Jang Song Thaek. By making it 
particularly visible, with state media declaring Jang a "traitor for all
 ages," Kim made sure there was no dissent to the decision.</p>
<p>He is also accused of ordering the assassination of his half-brother,
 Kim Jong Nam, earlier this year in Malaysia but North Korea has 
repeatedly and vehemently denied any involvement.</p>
<p>While ruthless and violent, Kim's behavior fits the profile of a 
leader acting out of his own self-interest, rather than emotion or 
impulse, Lee said -- a theme that is consistent in his dealings with the
 US as well.</p>
<p>"Kim's long-term goal is to come to some sort of big power agreement 
with the US and to remove US presence from the peninsula," Lee said, 
adding he wants to make North Korea relevant on the global stage again.</p>
<p>But Kim's efforts to develop a reliable long-range nuclear weapon 
have long conflicted with the security priorities of the US and its 
allies in the region -- a concern that has become more urgent in recent 
months in the wake of several successful missile and nuclear tests.</p>
<p>"North Korea is clearly testing the patience of the US and 
international community," Collins said. "With each increasing 
escalation, they're raising the threshold for the United States and 
others to accept or press back against that."</p>
<p>But Kim seems undeterred by Trump's threats despite the US President 
telling the United Nations General Assembly last month that Kim is "on a
 suicide mission for himself and for his regime."</p>
<p>China's influence overstated?</p>
<p>Kim's actions indicate he is no longer constrained by fears that 
China might abandon its support for his regime or that the US will 
launch a military strike -- two major factors that have tempered 
Pyongyang's boldness in the past, according to Lee.</p>
<p>Unbounded by those fears, the situation "becomes a tolerance of 
wills," Lee said, adding now the question is "how far will Kim Jong Un 
go?"</p>
<p>Collins and Lee both emphasized that China could still wield 
significant influence over North Korea but said Beijing would have to 
make the choice of prioritizing its relationship with the US over the 
strategic benefits of backing Pyongyang.</p>
<p>"China's strategic goal is to frustrate US and maintain division of 
peninsula," Lee said, adding that the US must continue to demonstrate to
 both Beijing and Pyongyang that all options remain on the table through
 shows of military force.</p>
<p>"First and foremost, the situation with North Korea is a test of what China wants in its relationship with US," Collins added.</p>
<p>According to Collins, the intelligence community is currently 
wrestling with questions related to North Korea's resolve and monitoring
 how major players in the region respond to Pyongyang's provocations in 
an effort to gauge how far the Kim regime is willing to push the 
envelope.</p>
<p>Kim remains unlikely to intentionally start a war with the US or its 
allies like South Korea as that would almost certainly result in his own
 destruction, according to Collins and Lee, but both CIA officials said 
they anticipate tensions with North Korea will continue -- raising the 
risk of a miscalculation from both sides.</p>
<p>"The South Korean and North Korean Navy's are going toe-to-toe every 
day ... there is potential for conflict at anytime," Lee said.</p>
<p>"We could stumble into something," DeTrani said, noting a potential 
scenario in which the US shoots down a North Korean missile deemed to be
 an imminent threat and prompting a response from Pyongyang.</p>
<p>And while the prospect of a North Korean preemptive strike on the US 
or one of its allies remains unlikely, DeTrani admitted that "there is a
 sense that North Korea is unpredictable if put into a corner."</p>
