<p>The iconic painting hangs everywhere in North Korea — in the offices 
of party functionaries and in homes, in factories and in schools. Kim Il
 Sung, founder of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), is 
depicted with his son Kim Jong Il. They are standing in front of Mount 
Paektu, a sacred site where, legend has it, the first kingdom of Korea 
was formed. The image is the most familiar representation of a ruling 
dynasty that has, in just two generations, ground North Korea into 
abject poverty and international isolation. Both men are gone now — the 
Dear Leader Kim Jong Il dying on Dec. 17 of a heart attack at age 69, 
just as his father did 17 years ago. In the wake of his departure, all 
eyes are on the young man who isn't in the picture: 29-year-old Kim Jong
 Un.</p>
<p>Since the late summer of 2008, when Kim Jong Il suffered a severe 
stroke, cadres in the ruling Workers' Party have been carefully grooming
 his third son, Kim Jong Un, for succession. Officially, that was to 
come in 2012, when North Korea will celebrate the 100th anniversary of 
Kim Il Sung's birth. The first indication that the succession plan still
 holds was Pyongyang's announcement on Dec. 19 of the formation of a 
232-member "funeral commission," which will be headed by the younger 
Kim. The funeral is scheduled for Dec. 28. </p>
<aside class="rm-manual"><a href="http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,2102766,00.html">(See pictures of North Korea's longtime dictator Kim Jong Il.)</a></aside><p>Little
 is known about Kim Jong Un. He attended a school for a couple of years 
in Bern, Switzerland, where he apparently became a fan of the National 
Basketball Association, and Michael Jordan in particular. (Whether that 
is true or just a cute biographical detail invented by North Korean 
propagandists is unclear.) He was always said to be his father's 
favorite, particularly after his older half brother Kim Jong Nam became 
something of an embarrassment by famously turning up in Japan in 2001 
with a phony passport, asking to visit Tokyo Disneyland. (He later began
 hanging out in casinos in Macau.)</p>
<p>Of late, Kim Jong Un has gained prominence in North Korea, putting on
 weight and bearing an unmistakable resemblance to his beefy grandfather
 Kim Il Sung. Most diplomatic and intelligence sources say there is 
little reason to suspect that his position as the heir is anything other
 than legitimate. Since 2008, he has been in charge of North Korea's 
police and intelligence services, two key ministries of political 
control. </p>
<aside class="rm-manual"><a href="http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,2022599,00.html">(See pictures of North Korea's heir apparent, Kim Jong Un.)</a></aside><p>Last
 year, he was given general's stars in the military and named vice 
chairman of the powerful Central Military Committee. Kim Jong Un's 
father had worked steadily to align his own interests with those of the 
military — one of the reasons, NGO officials have said, that so much 
food aid over the years intended for the general population has been 
diverted to the army. The Dear Leader's steadfast pursuit of a nuclear 
arsenal — and his unwillingness to trade the North's nuclear capability 
for economic favors from the outside world — was also in alignment with 
the military's wishes. "One has to presume the son would never have been
 put in this position [of] heir apparent had the generals not approved,"
 says a diplomatic source in Seoul.</p>
<p>Less certain is the political future and fate of the Dear Leader's 
brother-in-law Chang Sung Taek. After Kim Jong Il's stroke, Chang 
emerged as a regent-like figure, apparently on hand to guide Kim Jong Un
 should the young man have to assume leadership suddenly. However, on a 
recent visit to Pyongyang by TIME, a person who has met occasionally 
with Kim Jong Il (including earlier this year) asserted that Chang no 
longer occupies such a position. If that is true, it could be an 
indication of political infighting at the highest echelons of the DPRK. </p>
<aside class="rm-manual"><a href="http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1840297,00.html">(See pictures of the rise of Kim Jong Il.)</a></aside><p>Kim
 Jong Il's death comes just days after a bilateral meeting in Beijing 
between U.S. and DPRK officials, at which U.S. special envoy for human 
rights Robert King held talks with a senior DPRK foreign ministry 
official. Unconfirmed press reports in Seoul say Pyongyang agreed to 
allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency back into 
the country to impose a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests and to 
suspend its uranium-enrichment program, in return for 240,000 tons of 
food aid. However, analysts believe that this diplomatic momentum may be
 slowed by Kim Jong Il's death. As Kim Jong Un consolidates his 
political power, "North Korea will become even more inward-looking, at 
least for a while," says Bruce Klingner, senior fellow at the Heritage 
Institute and a former North Korea watcher at the CIA.</p>
<p>The good news, for an outside world that lives in fear of erratic 
behavior from the North, is that the younger Kim has had three years to 
prepare for the assumption of dictatorial power. "There's less of a 
concern about instability now than had Kim Jong Il died three years 
ago," Klingner says. At the same time, the DPRK has gone through a 
transition like this only once before, and that was when Kim Jong Il was
 52 years old. The country is once again having problems feeding itself,
 its economy is moribund, and problems are falling to a 29-year-old. 
It's a safe bet that if North Korea's propaganda artists haven't already
 prepared new iconography depicting the youngest Kim alongside his 
father and grandfather at Mount Paektu, they're busy doing so now.</p>
