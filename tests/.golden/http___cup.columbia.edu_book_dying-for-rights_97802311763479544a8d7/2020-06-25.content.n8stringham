<p>North Korea’s human rights violations are unparalleled in the 
contemporary world. In Dying for Rights, Sandra Fahy provides the 
definitive account of the abuses committed by the North Korean state, 
domestically and internationally, from its founding to the present.</p>
<p>Dying for Rights scrutinizes North Korea’s treatment of its own 
people as well as foreign nationals, how violations committed by the 
state spread into the international realm, and how North Korea uses its 
state media and presence at the United Nations. Fahy meticulously 
documents the extent of arbitrary detention, torture, executions, and 
the network of prison camps throughout the country. The book details 
systematic and widespread violations of freedom of speech and of 
movement, freedom from discrimination, and the rights to food and to 
life. Fahy weaves together public and private testimonies from North 
Koreans resettled abroad, as well as NGO reports, the stories and facts 
brought to light by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry into North 
Korea, and North Korea’s own state media, to share powerful personal 
narratives of human rights abuses. A compassionate yet objective 
investigation into the factors that sustain and perpetuate the flouting 
of basic rights, Dying for Rights reveals the profound culpability of 
the North Korean state in the systematic denial of human dignity.</p>
<blockquote> Readable, beautifully written, and often profound. Free Korea </blockquote>
<blockquote> This well-researched, multidisciplinary book, based on a 
wide range of source material, is intended for a wide audience. M. J. 
Frost, emerita, Wittenberg University, Choice </blockquote>
<blockquote> Dying for Rights is an exhaustive and important account of 
the human rights abuses that the Kim regime has inflicted on the North 
Korean people over decades, from the quotidian to the horrific. With her
 deep knowledge and her anthropological approach, augmented by her 
obvious compassion for the victims of this regime, Sandra Fahy has 
provided the basis for one day holding Kim Jong Un to account. A 
must-read. Anna Fifield, author of The Great Successor: The Divinely 
Perfect Destiny of Brilliant Comrade Kim Jong Un </blockquote>
<blockquote> The story of North Korean human rights abuses has been 
difficult to tell because so much of the problem remains shrouded by the
 state, with nameless and faceless victims. Fahy remedies this malady 
with a beautifully written and human story of human rights abuses in 
North Korea that takes us beyond hard-to-obtain statistics. Victor Cha, 
D. S. Song-KF Professor of Government, Georgetown University and former 
National Security Council director for Japan and Korea affairs </blockquote>
<blockquote> North Korea is a tragic symphony full of discordant themes.
 Famine. Surveillance. Detention. Oppression. Regimentation. 
Desperation. Suicide. Escape. These stories were told in the report to 
the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2014. Five years later, the 
tragedy continues. Dying for Rights confirms and expands the melancholy 
and frightening stories presented in 2014. This serious chronicle calls 
our distracted attention back to the human themes to which we must 
respond. Somber, compelling, and unrelenting chords from a dangerous 
land of ‘endless winter’ that still awaits the arrival of the sun. 
Michael Kirby, chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights 
Violations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, 2013-2014 </blockquote>
<blockquote> Sandra Fahy's Dying for Rights is a riveting and 
comprehensive account of the worst human rights violations occurring in 
the contemporary world. Fahy addresses the Kim regime's draconian 
coercion, control, surveillance, and punishment, and the plight of North
 Koreans crushed by a deliberate policy of human rights denial. She 
scrutinizes the lives of North Koreans abused and exploited at home and 
abroad. She addresses all themes relevant to understanding the North 
Korean human rights crisis, from political prison camps to refugees and 
laborers officially dispatched overseas to work under abysmal 
conditions. She sheds light on the dynamics of the North Korean escapee 
community. Fahy illuminates a new dimension of evidence collected by the
 UN Commission of Inquiry by transcending legal analysis and looking at 
escapee testimony through an anthropological lens. Greg Scarlatoiu, 
executive director of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea </blockquote>
