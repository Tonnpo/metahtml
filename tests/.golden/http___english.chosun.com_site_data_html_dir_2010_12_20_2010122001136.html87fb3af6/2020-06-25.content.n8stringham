<h1 class="rm-manual">Kim Jong-un 'Loves Nukes, Computer Games and Johnny Walker' </h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> December 20, 2010 13:44 </p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual">Kenji Fujimoto</figcaption><p>Kim Jong-un,
 the third son and heir of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, showed a 
strong affection for nuclear weapons since he was a child, according to 
Kim senior's former personal chef. Kenji Fujimoto quoted Kim Jong-un as 
saying uranium mines are the North's "sole assets." </p>
<p>Fujimoto was Kim's chef for 13 years until he fled the communist 
county in 2001 and knew both his second son Jong-chol and Jong-un since 
they were small. Having recently published the Korean edition of a book 
entitled "North Korea's Heir, Why Kim Jong-un?," Fujimoto told the 
Chosun Ilbo in Seoul on Friday that Jong-un briefly returned to North 
Korea from his studies abroad in the early 2000s and said, "Our 
industrial technology lags behind. All we have is uranium ore." </p>
<p>Fujimoto said Kim senior showed his preference for his youngest son 
since the boys were young, saying in front of top officials, "The big 
one [Jong-chol] has a weak heart and is feminine, but the young one is 
manly." "To a first-time observer, it looked like Jong-un was the older 
brother and Jong-chol the younger," Fujimoto said.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-il told Jong-un since he was 15 that a man had to hold his 
liquor and allowed him to drink, but ordered him not to smoke. Jong-un 
favored Johnny Walker whisky and secretly smoked Yves Saint Laurent 
cigarettes with Fujimoto. He had a Mercedes 600 sedan and was fond of 
South Korean pop music and the Super Mario Brothers and Tetris computer 
games. </p>
<p>Fujimoto recalled Jong-un once told him, "I roller blade, play 
basketball and go jet skiing in the summer, but I wonder how other 
people live." he visited Tokyo Disney Land with his mother Ko Young-hui.
 </p>
<p>Jong-un seemed less interested in girls than Jong-chol but became 
wide-eyed with fascination whenever he saw female North Korean dance 
troupes perform, according to the ex-chef. "Just like Kim Jong-il, 
Jong-un will probably choose a bride according to his preference rather 
than according to his father's instructions," he said. </p>
<p>Asked about the heir's podgy shape, Fujimoto speculated that Kim 
Jong-il made Jong-un gain weight to give him more of a leader's 
gravity." </p>
<p>Kim Jong-il classified his female dance troupes into four categories 
according to their height (155 cm, 160 cm, 165 cm and 170 cm) and had 
them compete against each other. Once, he ordered dancers to perform 
naked and told senior officials to dance with them. Fujimoto said Kim 
was appare ntly trying to recreate the strip shows of the West. </p>
<p>Kim senior survived an assassination attempt in the late 1980s, when 
one of his bodyguards, drunk, aimed his gun at the leader's head during 
an evening stroll at a villa in Hamhung Province, according to Fujimoto.
 But the man was overpowered by other security personnel and executed on
 the spot. </p>
