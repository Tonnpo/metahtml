<aside class="rm-manual"> June 13, 2016 by <a href="http://realnewsrightnow.com/author/hobbus/" rel="author">R. Hobbus J.D.</a> </aside><p>NEW
 YORK, Ny. – A cache of top-secret documents published by the 
controversial whistle-blower website Wikileaks on Monday revealed that 
in September of 2014, North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un traveled 
in secret to the United States where, posing as a Japanese sumo 
wrestler, he underwent ankle surgery at one of New York City’s most 
prestigious hospitals.</p>
<p>In October of 2014, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service 
reported in a briefing to lawmakers that a cyst had been found on the 
North Korean dictator’s right ankle. Intelligence analysts believed at 
the time that due to possible muscle or nerve damage, Kim had undergone 
surgery to remove the cyst at the hands of several “European experts” 
that were flown to Pyongyang.</p>
<p>However, according to internal CIA communications obtained by 
Wikileaks, Kim and a small entourage, all carrying forged Japanese 
passports and identification papers, flew from Beijing International 
Airport on a direct flight to New York’s JFK International Airport. 
“From the moment they landed, they were under intense surveillance,” a 
U.S. intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity told The 
New York Times. </p>
<p>Kim Jong-un, accompanied by a handful of high-ranking North Korean 
officials, checked into the Plaza, a five-star luxury hotel opposite 
Central Park on Fifth Avenue. According to hotel records obtained by The
 New York Times, Kim was registered under the name ‘Keito Kamatsu’ and 
prior to his arrival, hotel staff were briefed on Kim’s fictitious 
status as a world-renowned sumo champion.</p>
<p>“We were absolutely delighted to host Mr. Keito,” Grace Baldwin, a 
concierge at the Plaza hotel, told the New York Daily News. Ms. Baldwin 
described Kim as jovial yet reserved. He reminded her of “an over-sized 
teddy bear, like the kind they used to sell at FAO Schwarz.” Baldwin 
went on to say that Kim and his entourage racked up more than $26,000 in
 room service charges during their three-week stay. “Most of it was 
spent on desserts,” she admitted.</p>
<p>However, splurging on lavish desserts wasn’t all the autocratic 
dictator did while visiting the Big Apple. On September 19, 2014, Kim 
Jong-un checked into the New York-Presbyterian Hospital where he 
underwent surgery to remove the cyst on his ankle. According to a 
document marked TOP SECRET//SCI//NOFORN, meaning sensitive 
compartmentalized information that should not be viewed by foreign 
nationals, two members of the CIA’s Special Activities Division were 
present and posing as hospital staff during the procedure.</p>
<p>Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who reviewed the classified 
material in full, said it’s not clear what role – if any – the CIA 
agents might have played during Kim’s operation at New 
York-Presbyterian. “Were they merely there to observe or was there a 
more sinister purpose behind their presence?” Assange speculated as to 
whether the CIA may have implanted a tracking device in the North Korean
 leader’s ankle before doctors had a chance to sew him up and send him 
on his way.</p>
