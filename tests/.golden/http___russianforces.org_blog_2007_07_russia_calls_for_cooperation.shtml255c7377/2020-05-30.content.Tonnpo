<p class="rm-manual"> [<a href="http://russianforces.org/">Home</a>] [<a href="http://russianforces.org/blog/">Blog</a>] [Russia calls for broader cooperation] </p>
<h1 class="rm-manual"><a href="http://russianforces.org/blog/2007/07/russia_calls_for_cooperation.shtml">Russia calls for broader cooperation</a></h1>
<p>The meeting of two presidents in Kennebunkport was not expected to 
produce any tangible results. But this depends on what do you call 
"results". In my view, it did produce an important outcome - the call 
for broader cooperation made by the Russian president. </p>
<p>President Putin confirmed his proposal to jointly use the radar in Gabala, Azerbaijan and extended this offer to the <a href="http://russianforces.org/blog/2006/02/voronezhdms_potential.shtml">new radar that Russia is building in Armavir</a>.
 Then he called for revival of the Joint Data Exchange Center (JDEC), 
that has been languishing in a bureaucratic limbo for almost ten years. 
As a way of engaging Europe into this arrangement, he proposed opening a
 similar center in, say, Brussels. In President Putin's words at the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/07/20070702-2.html">press-conference</a>,</p>
<blockquote>Such cooperation I believe would result in raising to an 
entirely new level the quality of cooperation between Russia and the 
United States. And for all practical purposes, this would lead to a 
gradual development of strategic partnership in the area of security.</blockquote>
<p> This is exactly the right logic. The more the United States and 
Russia engage in various cooperative projects, the easier it would be 
for them to settle all kind of disagreements (and prevent them from 
occurring in the first place). As much as I am skeptical (to put it 
mildly) about missile defense, I have </p>
<p><a href="http://russianforces.org/blog/2007/04/a_usrussian_missile_defense_co.shtml">argued</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://russianforces.org/blog/2007/06/a_joint_usrussian_missile_defe.shtml">before</a> that cooperation in this area would be very valuable. I have </p>
<p><a href="http://russianforces.org/blog/2006/10/russia_and_the_prompt_global_strike.shtml">some questions about the JDEC idea</a> as well, but overall it is a much more valuable and much more promising program. </p>
<p>It would be unfortunate if the Bush administration rejects or ignores
 the Russian call for cooperation, as it probably will. Of course, at 
the moment it looks like Russia is asking the price that many in the 
United States would argue is too high - it wants the United States to 
reconsider its plan to build missile defense sites in Poland and Czech 
Republic. But in reality Russia is asking for something else - it mostly
 wants to be part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Yes, the missile defense installations in Eastern Europe is the main 
Russian grudge of the moment, but nothing says that it will remain this 
way forever. Especially if Russia and the United States would engage in a
 serious discussion about it. Besides, the current location of the radar
 and interceptors is largely a result of political calculation, rather 
than of technical ones. Ted Postol has done some good calculations that 
show that a radar in Azerbaijan would work very well and that Poland is 
not an optimal place for interceptors (the U.S.-friendly Albania would 
be much better). So, even those who wish the U.S. missile defense 
program well may want to reconsider the decision to go with the current 
radar and interceptor sites.</p>
<p>I'm not very optimistic about the United States being serious about 
Russian offer. I just don't see that this administration is able to 
recognize it as an opportunity, much less to act on it. But who knows? 
Let's hope it will.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">I agree ... the White House is now embroiled with a
 Congressional showdown and Mr. Bush is running out of time to be 
cooperative with any Russian President. Let's hope the next era will 
bring a larger discussion in the realm of cooperation. Poland and the 
Czech sites definitely were political choices - maybe even to the degree
 where NATO has a problem with the US stance on this choice. A golden 
opportunity to work with Russia will be lost for the next several years 
as progression of this takes place and Russia will react defensively ...
 and rhetorically!</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Was the Albania solution for interceptors Ted 
Postolâ€™s conclusion or yours? If site locations in Bulgaria or Rumania
 were rejected by the Pentagon, I wonder why Albania is a â€œbetter 
solutionâ€. I donâ€™t understand the science here in the least but I 
have concluded in reading such a Balkan installation is too close to 
Iran for the US GBI system to engage. Is this conclusion in error?</p>
<p class="rm-manual">And, why is Albania more U.S.-friendly than Poland or the Czech Republic? (smile) </p>

<p class="rm-manual">i have some questions about the missile shield that i want to ask to people who know the subject.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">1 - The real Russia concern about these missile 
defence shields isnÂ´t about the possibility of future space 
interceptors satelittes or space based weapons that added with the 
radars would endanger Russia if it donÂ´t challenge this trend now?</p>
<p class="rm-manual">2 - It isnÂ´t a proof of USA real intentions, about
 nuclear or missile supremacy, against Russia when it openly and 
instantly discharge Russia proposal for joint monitoring and joint 
reaction to Iranian Missiles, in regard to the Gabala Radar Station?</p>
<p class="rm-manual">3 Of course Russia can suppres 10 missile 
interceptors but isnÂ´t Russia right for no wanting to face another 
strategic arms race with USA since both are supposedly to be respectful 
partners?</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> (Russia could, very well, had quietly retargeted 
its cruise missiles with nuclear weapons at Europe without tryng to 
achieve a joint solution or Russia could had also put nuclear weapons in
 space if it was for stopping any threat to its strategic arsenal so 
that USA couldnÂ´t achieve nuclear supremacy at any circunstance but, 
instead of that Russia is searching for a deal so Russia, I think, 
deserves a lot of credit for its behavior, instead of USA that is 
looking for more supremacy over the world above what they already have)</p>

<p class="rm-manual">One thing to keep in mind about Ted Postol is he is
 to missile defense what the Fighter Mafia was to the F-15 (and now are 
to the F-22). The words "axes" and "agendas" come to mind. </p>

his technical analysis is invariably good. Besides, it's usually his 
opponents who have an agenda.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> By the way, here is my post to a previous thread 
where we were discussing ABL and such. I think this might have been 
â€œlost in posting": </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Timely article to our discussion published this week in Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology (June 18th addition). </p>
<p class="rm-manual">It appears the ABL is once again in favor with the 
military as many technical obstacles have been overcome. Testing is 
going well and there seems to be some genuine excitement on the 
possibilities. It appears the gravest issue; the use of deformable 
mirrors shaped by hundreds of actuators that compensate for the 
distortion impaired by the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, has been achieved. The 
article also mentions the rebirth the resurrected THEL ground based 
laser system, cancelled in 2005, as the new Northrop Grumman MTHEL 
(Mobile Tactical High-Energy Laser). Boeing is getting into the act by 
testing a laser system designed to hit manpad missiles and Lockheed is 
planning an offensive system for the F-35. As for the ABL, while the 
military now seems to be a fan, Congress, who supported this concept 
almost in defiance of the Pentagon, has growing skepticism. While 
billions of dollars have been poured into these systems, operational 
deadlines for actually producing a weapon system continue to be pushed 
to the distant future; ABL faces a funding cut, moderate, in the 2008 
Defense Budget. Interesting read.</p>
