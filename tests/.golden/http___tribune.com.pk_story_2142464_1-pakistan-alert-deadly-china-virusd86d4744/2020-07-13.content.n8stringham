<p class="rm-manual">Emergency operation cell set up to monitor the situation</p>

<p><span> ISLAMABAD: The health ministry on Wednesday directed the 
authorities concerned to remain alert following the possible spread of 
coronavirus from China and established an emergency operation cell to 
monitor the situation. Special Assistant to the PM on Health Dr Zafar 
Mirza while chairing a meeting of senior officials discussed the 
precautionary measures and a response mechanism in the wake of the 
recent cases of Corona virus emerging across China. The virus has spread
 to five countries including the US. The PM’s aide told the participants
 of the meeting that the directorate of the health ministry dealing with
 airport and port health services had been asked to maintain strict 
vigilance at the points of entry and check travellers coming in from 
affected areas. “The directorate has been advised to strengthen health 
desk and quarantine arrangements at the ports of entry,” he added. There
 are 41 incoming flights from China to Pakistan every week. “I am 
writing to all chief ministers to ensure necessary arrangements in all 
the provinces,” said Mirza. “I am establishing contact with the National
 Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) while we will also be working 
closely with the Embassy of China in Pakistan to deal with the crisis.” <a href="http://i1.tribune.com.pk/story/2141331/3-china-virus-outbreak-spooks-global-markets-fourth-death-reported/">China virus outbreak spooks global markets as fourth death reported</a>
 The special assistant to the PM said there was no need to panic as the 
situation was being monitored, adding that regular updates concerning 
the virus will be shared with the public. On the directions of the PM’s 
aide, the National Institute of Health Islamabad has issued an advisory 
and alert to all provincial health departments especially at points of 
entry at all airports and ground crossings in Pakistan to remain 
vigilant. The purpose of the advisory, according to NHS, is to alert and
 sensitise the health staff across the country to detect suspected cases
 of the viral infection and take preventive measures. The death toll 
from the new SARS-like virus rose to 17 on Wednesday. The coronavirus 
has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland 
China in 2002-2003. With hundreds of millions of people travelling 
across China this week for the Lunar New Year holiday, the National 
Health Commission announced measures to contain the disease, including 
sterilisation and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as 
inside planes and trains. In Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, large
 public events were cancelled and international football matches were 
moved to a new location. Visitors were urged to stay away, while 
residents were advised to not to leave the central city, which is home 
to 11 million people. "If it's not necessary we suggest that people 
don't come to Wuhan," Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster 
CCTV. The illness is mainly transmitted via the respiratory tract and 
there "is the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the 
disease", health commission vice minister Li Bin told a news conference 
in Beijing. More than 500 cases have now been reported, with the 
majority in Wuhan, capital of China’s Hubei province. The virus has now 
infected at least 444 people in Hubei province alone, said provincial 
Chinese officials at a press conference, adding that the death toll had 
risen from nine to 17. Major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and 
Chongqing have also reported cases, as well as provinces in 
northeastern, central, and southern China. The World Health Organisation
 started an emergency meeting on Wednesday to decide whether or not to 
declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which 
has now been detected in the United States, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and 
South Korea. The Chinese government has classified the outbreak in the 
same category as the SARS epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for 
those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement 
quarantine measures. But they still have not been able to confirm the 
exact source of the virus. "We will step up research efforts to identify
 the source and transmission of the disease," Li said, adding that "the 
cases are mostly linked to Wuhan". Countries have intensified efforts to
 stop the spread of the pathogen - known by its technical name 2019 
Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Passengers are facing screening measures 
at five US airports and a host of transport hubs across Asia. Britain 
and Italy on Wednesday also announced enhanced monitoring of passengers 
from Wuhan. A prominent expert from China's National Health Commission 
confirmed this week that the virus can be passed between people. 
However, animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak.
 A Wuhan market is believed to be the epicentre of the outbreak. (With
