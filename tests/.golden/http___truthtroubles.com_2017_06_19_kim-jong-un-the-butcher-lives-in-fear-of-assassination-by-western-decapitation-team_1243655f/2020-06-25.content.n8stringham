<h1 class="rm-manual">Kim Jong Un lives in fear of assassination by western ‘decapitation’ team, says report</h1>

<p class="rm-manual">NOW PLAYINGEric Shawn reports: Can China really rein in Kim Jong Un?</p>
<p>North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is reportedly so terrified of being
 targeted for assassination that he travels incognito inside the Hermit 
Kingdom, and there’s growing evidence his paranoia may be well-founded.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old, third-generation ruler is “extremely nervous” about a
 clandestine plot to take him out, according to a key South Korean 
lawmaker who spoke to The Korea Herald. Rep. Lee Cheol-woo, chairman of 
the South Korean parliament’s intelligence committee, made the claim 
based on reports from South Korea’s intelligence agency.</p>
<p>“Kim is engrossed with collecting information about the ‘decapitation
 operation’ through his intelligence agencies,” Lee said following a 
briefing last week.</p>
<p>“Kim is engrossed with collecting information about the ‘decapitation operation’ through his intelligence agencies.”</p>

<p>The rumored “decapitation plan” to target Kim and key deputies in the
 event fighting broke out on the peninsula first surfaced in late 2015, 
when the U.S. and South Korea signed “Operation Plan 5015,” a joint 
strategy for possible war scenarios with North Korea. According to the 
Brookings Institute, the plan “envisions limited warfare with an 
emphasis on preemptive strikes on strategic targets in North Korea and 
“decapitation raids” to exterminate North Korean leaders.”</p>
<p>Something about the term “decapitation” seems to have gotten the 
attention of the gout-addled, unpredictable and violent dictator. 
According to Lee, Kim’s is so frightened that he now disguises his 
movements, travels primarily at dawn and in the cars of his henchmen. 
Public appearances and jaunts in his prized Mercedes Benz 600 have been 
curtailed.</p>

<p>Kim Jong Un is petrified that he could be the target of a “decapitation” raid. <span>(Reuters)</span></p>
<p>North Korea’s United Nations representative referenced the “beheading
 operation” in a sternly worded, 2016 letter to the body’s Security 
Council, suggesting that the joint military operations regularly 
conducted by the U.S. and South Korea “constitute a grave threat to 
[North Korea] as well as international peace and security.”</p>
<p>By January of this year, there were reports that South Korea was 
speeding up the creation of a specialized unit designed for this 
mission, initially slated to be ready by 2019.</p>
<p>During this year’s Foal Eagle and Key Resolve exercises with South 
Korea, one of the largest annual military exercises in the world, 
members of U.S. Navy SEAL teams reportedly participated in decapitation 
drills with our South Korean counterparts for the first time. Naval 
officials denied reports that members of SEAL Team 6, the group that 
took out Usama Bin Laden, took part.</p>
<p>Shortly after those war games, however, the USS Michigan, a submarine
 that is sometimes used to move U.S. Special Forces, took a position 
just off of North Korea’s coast.</p>
<p>While there are concerns that taking out North Korea’s leader might 
not be enough, a White House review revealed earlier this year that the 
U.S. strategy on North Korea does include the possibility of regime 
change.</p>

<p>The Navy SEAL raid that took out Bin Laden in 2011 was easy compared to the challenge of assassinating Kim, say experts. <span>(Associated Press)</span></p>
<p>Kim has become a major problem regionally and for the U.S. as well. 
Pyongyang has repeatedly tested missiles potentially capable of 
delivering nuclear warheads and Kim’s threats against South Korea, Japan
 and the U.S. have grown increasingly bellicose. Last week, North Korea 
returned American college student Otto Warmbier after holding him for 17
 months on a dubious charge. Doctors say Warmbier underwent devastating 
brain injuries while in North Korean custody and is now in an 
unresponsive state. Three other U.S. citizens remain locked up in the 
reclusive nation’s infamous gulags.</p>
<p>But while taking out Kim may be a possibility, experts say it would 
be much more complicated that the 2011 raid in Pakistan in which CIA 
operatives and SEALs took out Bin Laden.</p>
<p>“A U.S. special operations strike against Kim Jong Un in today’s 
conditions would make the bin Laden raid look easy,” said Mark Sauter, a
 former U.S. Army and special forces officer who operated in the Korean 
de-militarized zone during the Cold War and now blogs about the 
decades-long effort to defend South Korea at <a href="http://www.dmzwar.com/" rel="noopener">www.dmzwar.com</a>.</p>
<p>The daring, night-time raid on the Abbottabad compound went off 
nearly flawlessly. But U.S. forces would face much more deadly 
opposition in an assault on the North Korean capital.</p>
<p>“Pyongyang is surrounded by antiaircraft weapons, and while the 
corpulent Kim presents a large and sluggish target, he’s kept on the 
move, always surrounded by fanatical guards and often near or in complex
 underground compounds,” Sauter said.</p>
<p>Despite those potential challenges, Sauter suggests the North Korean 
leader “does need to worry about strikes by precision-guided missiles 
and bunker-buster bombs in the early stages of a preemptive allied 
attack, and if a conflict continues, everything from (Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicles) to special operators will be on his tracks.”</p>
