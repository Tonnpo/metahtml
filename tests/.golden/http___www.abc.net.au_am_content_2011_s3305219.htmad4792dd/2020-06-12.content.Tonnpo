<p> TONY EASTLEY: Bird flu has largely slipped from the public's 
consciousness but now the UN is warning authorities to be again on high 
alert.</p>
<p>It says the virus appears to be returning and a mutant strain is spreading across parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It says there could be a spill-over to humans but there's no need, at this stage, for any alarm.</p>
<p>Lexi Metherell reports.</p>
<p>LEXI METHERELL: Bird flu is back.</p>
<p>Outbreaks of the virus peaked in 2006 before it was eradicated from most countries. </p>
<p>But now the United Nations is warning the virus could rear its head 
again on a major scale with unpredictable risks for human health. </p>
<p>JAN SLINGENBERGH: We've seen a comeback of the virus in different 
countries in Asia. And we believe that this virus is doing very well in 
poultry, chicken to chicken transmission, but it also does show quite 
good affinity with several wild bird species.</p>
<p>LEXI METHERELL: And that's the concern for the UN.</p>
<p>Wild birds can carry the virus further than domestic birds.</p>
<p>The virus has remained entrenched in Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India,
 Indonesia and Vietnam, and the UN is concerned about a mutant strain of
 the virus spreading across Asia.</p>
<p>It says a variant of the virus has appeared in China and Vietnam which appears able to side step Vaccines.</p>
<p>The UN is concerned the new form of the virus could spread to 
Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, as well as the Korean Peninsula and 
Japan.</p>
<p>Jan Slingenbergh is the senior animal health officer with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization. </p>
<p>JAN SLINGENBERGH: We are moving into fall in the northern hemisphere 
and because of that we do expect an increased flair up. Mainly because 
of migratory bird affected viruses in the areas stretching from eastern 
Asia all the way to Siberia and the Arabian Peninsula and perhaps the 
Black Sea Basin.</p>
<p>LEXI METHERELL: Jan Slingenbergh says it's time for authorities to ramp up surveillance and preparations for an outbreak. </p>
<p>JAN SLINGENBERGH: We are worried about veterinary services to become 
ready and to make sure that they early detect and response to any flair 
up of viruses.</p>
<p>LEXI METHERELL: But at this stage the UN and other experts say public
 health authorities don't need to worry about the virus spilling over 
into humans. </p>
<p>University of Sydney Professor, Robert Booy has studied bird flu extensively.</p>
<p>ROBERT BOOY: Bird flu has been around more than 10 years now and 
largely restricted to Asia and South-East Asia. In humans we've seen 
less than 600 cases in that time, but over half of them died. No cases 
whatsoever in Australia and for the moment I see no prospect of 
Australia being affected.</p>
<p>LEXI METHERELL: We've seen this variant of the virus now, the UN is 
warning that it's mutated, is there a risk that could spill over into 
humans?</p>
<p>ROBERT BOOY: The concern with the new mutation in Vietnam is that it 
will spread through poultry and wild birds in Asia; so neighbouring 
countries to begin with - Thailand and China.</p>
<p>The mutation has resulted in the virus becoming resistant to the 
vaccine they were using in birds, in poultry and therefore the vaccine 
isn't working as well as it was. It doesn't mean that the virus is more 
transmissible, that's a different set of mutations that need to occur 
before that problem will happen.</p>
<p>So we've seen this virus, as I've said, more than 10 years. It still 
hasn't learnt how to transmit well between humans. It could do, but for 
the moment it's not showing a sign of doing that.</p>
<p>TONY EASTLEY: Professor Robert Booy of the University of Sydney ending that report by Lexi Metherell. </p>

<p class="rm-manual">Around 500 Indigenous people fought in the First 
World War, and as many as 5,000 in the second. But many Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander diggers who made it home received little or no 
recognition for their contribution. On Anzac Day, 2007, the first parade
 to commemorate their efforts and bravery was held in Sydney. Listen to 
our report from that day by Lindy Kerin.</p>
