<h1 class="rm-manual"> Seoul Purpose</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">by <span><span><a href="https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/author/jeffrey/" rel="author">Jeffrey Lewis</a></span></span> | <span>April 22, 2010</span> | <span><a href="https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/202708/seoul-purpose/#comments">12 Comments</a></span></p>
<p>The <span>DPRK</span> has issued its own “nuclear posture review” — 
actually a “memorandum” titled something like “The Korean Peninsula and 
the Nuclear Issue” (<a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2010/201004/news21/20100421-27ee.html">English</a> | <a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/calendar/2010/04/04-21/2010-0421-024.html">Korean</a>).</p>
<p>The Korean version is substantially longer and more detailed. It needs a decent translation, including the title.</p>
<p>I can’t decide whether I am pleasantly surprised or sort of disappointed, but the <a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/calendar/2010/04/04-21/2010-0421-024.html"><span>DPRK</span> nuclear memo</a>
 lacks much of the bluster that typically livens up any effort at 
reading North Korean propaganda. Indeed, the declaratory language is 
pretty modest stuff:</p>
<p>The mission of the nuclear armed forces of the <span>DPRK</span> is 
to deter and repulse aggression and attack on the country and the nation
 till the nuclear weapons are eliminated from the peninsula and the rest
 of the world. The <span>DPRK</span> has invariably maintained the 
policy not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states or threaten
 them with nukes as long as they do not join nuclear weapons states in 
invading or attacking it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <span>DPRK</span> seems to have modeled US declaratory policy more than, say, Chinese.</p>

 It is interesting to see that, indeed, DPRK possesses some deterrent

 suspect that what a functional 4 kt weapon is “missing”, is not half a

 to the US Mark 5/7/12, shoehorned into a Nodong-style RV and thus 
forced to accept a somewhat lower compression (and so yield). </p> <p class="rm-manual">
 Meaning, I also am skeptical that NK is unable to deliver its nukes. 
That’s not so much dogma as just wishful thinking, but dubious either

 can put four kilotons of instant sunshine inside a missile, today.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 And four kilotons over downtown Tokyo, Seoul, or San Francisco would

 The construction of a nuclear-free world is mankind’s ardent wish that 
has been maintained from the 20th century to the 21st century.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is a part of global 
denuclearization. The Six-Party Talks have been held over the past years
 for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but the talks are 
currently facing grave obstacles without producing results that are 
worth a mention. Along with the deep-seated distrust among the parties 
concerned, the main reason is because some countries participating in 
the talks are seriously distorting the essence of the issue for their 
sinister objectives. If the essence of the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula is to be precisely understood and if the way of its 
realization is to be correctly found, it is essential to correctly 
realize the initial circumstances and causes of the nuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> 1. The Most Serious Nuclear Victim in the World</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 Never has there been such a nation in the world as the Korean nation 
that has suffered nuclear threat most directly and for the longest 
period. For our people, nuclear threat is by no means an abstract 
concept but a realistic and concrete experience.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 Our nation is the one that directly sustained the damage caused in 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States’ nuclear attacks, and it is 
the nation that suffered the most casualties there, only next to the 
Japanese.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> For the people that directly 
experienced the horrible catastrophes of atomic bombs, the atomic bomb 
blackmail that the United States wielded during the days of the Korean 
war was literally a nightmare. After US President Truman on 30 November 
1950 openly mentioned the use of atomic bombs on the Korean front, an 
order was given on the same day to the US Strategic Air Command on 
“Maintaining a standby status to fly bombers to immediately drop atomic 
bombs in the Far East.” In December of the same year, [Douglas] 
MacArthur, Commander of the US Forces Far East, let loose an outburst, 
“A radioactive corridor will be created from the East Sea [Sea of Japan]
 to the West Sea [Yellow Sea] of the northern region of Korea. In this 
region living things will not be able to resurrect over the next 60 
years or 120 years.” </p> <p class="rm-manual"> Because of the United 
States’ nuclear blackmail, the rows of “atomic bomb refugees” were 
created to flow from north to south of the Korean peninsula during the 
war. When entire family members were unable to leave together, many 
families forced their husbands or sons to evacuate to the South with 
only the desire to maintain their family bloodlines. Millions of the 
“separated families” created through this course are still living 
divided in the North and the South of the Korean peninsula.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 The United States is the ringleader who was the first to bring nuclear 
weapons into the Korean peninsula. When the retention of the pro-US 
regime was jeopardized, as the anti-nuclear campaign was escalating in 
Japan in the late 1950s, the United States moved the nuclear weapons 
deployed in Japan to South Korea. In 1957, the United States’ first 
strategic nuclear weapons were brought from Japan into South Korea and 
deployed there. In the end, the United States nuclearized the Korean 
peninsula in place of the “denuclearization” of Japan. The United 
States’ deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea constantly built 
up, and the number of nuclear weapons reached over approximately 1,000 
in the mid 1970s.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> From the late 1960s, the 
United States began to stage joint military exercises to actually use 
the nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea in a war of aggression 
against our Republic. The US-South Korea joint nuclear war exercise — 
which began with the “Focus Retina” operations in 1969 — has ceaselessly
 continued every year since then for such a long, long period of 40-odd 
years, while its name being changed to “Freedom Bolt,” “Team Spirit,” 
“Reception, Staging, Onward Movement, and Integration [RSOI],” “Key 
Resolve,” “Foal Eagle,” and “Ulchi Freedom Guardian,” and the like.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 It is precisely a stark nuclear reality of the Korean peninsula that 
even the post-war generations have grown in this way while inhaling 
nuclear powder odor as the targets of the US nuclear weapons that are 
deployed in South Korea for a real war.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> 2. The Effort That the Government of the Republic Has Made To Remove US Nuclear Threat</p> <p class="rm-manual"> The DPRK’s effort aimed at removing the United States’ nuclear threat has been made in three stages.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 In the first stage, the government of the Republic made an effort to 
remove the United States’ nuclear threat by the method of creating a 
denuclearized zone through peaceful dialogue and negotiations.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 In 1959, it [government of the Republic] proposed to establish an 
atomic bomb-free peace zone in Asia; in 1981, it put forth a proposal 
for the establishment of a denuclearized zone in Northeast Asia; and in 
1986, it proposed to turn the Korean peninsula into a non-nuclear-weapon
 region and made an active effort for its implementation.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 On 10 January 1984, it proposed the convening of three-party talks — 
the talks in which the South Korean authorities, too, would participate 
in the DPRK-US talks to be held to remove the danger of a nuclear war; 
and in a government statement released on 23 June 1986 it solemnly 
declared that it would not test, produce, store, or introduce nuclear 
weapons, would not allow any military bases, including foreign nuclear 
bases, and would not allow the transit of foreign nuclear weapons via 
its territorial land, territorial airspace, and territorial waters.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 Nevertheless, the United States has escalated the nuclear threat to us 
while ignoring all our efforts exerted to create a non-nuclear-weapon 
region in the Korean peninsula.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> In the second 
stage, the government of the Republic combined efforts to remove the 
United States’ nuclear threat based on international law.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 In 1978, the depositary states of the NPT — the United States, the 
former Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom — issued, though 
conditional, a “non-use of nuclear weapons” statement [stating] that 
they would not use nuclear weapons against the non-nuclear-weapon states
 that joined the treaty. The DPRK joined the treaty in December 1985 
with a hope that this would help the removal of the United States’ 
nuclear threat to us.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> When the United States 
made a pledge that it would discontinue the “Team Spirit” nuclear war 
exercise, we, based on the relevant NPT clause, actively helped the 
aperiodic inspections that the IAEA conducted six times during the 
period of May 1992 through February 1993.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> 
Nevertheless, the United States, by instigating the sinister forces in 
the agency while talking about the so-called “suspicion about nuclear 
development,” fabricated a “resolution for special inspection” targeting
 not only our nuclear facilities but even our sensitive military 
targets, even before the completion of the agency’s aperiodic 
inspections based on the safeguard agreement. Since then, the brigandish
 nature of such a mandatory inspection was completely laid bare through 
the Iraqi situation. Under the pretext of inspection, the United States 
combed even the Iraqi Presidential Palace and concocted the 
“intelligence” that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 
order to use it as an excuse to carry out military strikes. Later on, it
 was revealed to the whole world that the “intelligence” that Iraq has 
weapons of mass destruction was a groundless fabrication, but it was too
 late; it was already after the country collapsed, and the nation had 
become submerged in a sea of blood.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> In order 
to impose a “special inspection” on us, the United States blatantly 
perpetrated nuclear threat by even resuming the “Team Spirit” joint 
military exercise that it already suspended. After all, it was 
impossible to stop the United States’ high-handedness even with the 
international treaty, and it had become clear that the treaty was 
actually being abused as a tool to justify the United States’ coercion.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 Based on Article 10 of the NPT, the DPRK on 12 March 1993 declared its 
withdrawal from the NPT for the defense of the country’s sovereignty and
 security and informed the depository states of the fact. Then, when the
 United States responded for DPRK-US talks, it [DPRK] took measures to 
unilaterally and temporarily suspend the effectuation of its withdrawal 
from the NPT — through the DPRK-US joint statement on 11 June 1993 — 
while DPRK-US talks were underway.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> On 21 
October 1994 during the Clinton administration, the “DPRK-US Agreed 
Framework” was adopted to resolve the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula, but the United States unilaterally scrapped it when the Bush 
administration was inaugurated. In the “State of the Union Address” on 
30 January 2002, the Bush administration even called us part of an “axis
 of evil.” The harboring of such hostility toward a country by the 
world’s largest nuclear power state means the greatest nuclear threat to
 that country. In particular, when the United States announced in March 
in that year the “Nuclear Posture Review [NPR],” which included us in 
the “targets for preemptive nuclear strikes,” the security of our 
country and nation was placed in extremely grave jeopardy of nuclear 
catastrophes.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> It had become clear that the 
effort made through dialogue and the effort exerted based on 
international law all ended up in smoke. The unique situation on the 
Korean peninsula, which could be found nowhere else in the world, 
required a special measure for a solution. The only and last option was 
to counter “nuclear weapons with nuclear weapons.” With the most serious
 nuclear threat, the United States was persistently compelling us to 
possess nuclear weapons.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> On 10 January 2003, 
the government of the Republic took a resolute, self-defensive measure 
of completely withdrawing from the NPT by bringing into effect the 
withdrawal from it, which it had suspended for 10 years. After 
delivering itself from the treaty, it [the government of the Republic] 
turned in the direction of legally and stately weaponizing the entire 
amount of the plutonium produced in the course of producing electricity 
from a pilot atomic power plant. It conducted the first nuclear test in 
October 2006, three years after its withdrawal from the treaty, and the 
second nuclear test in May 2009.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> By this, the 
state of nuclear imbalance in Northeast Asia where nuclear weapons and 
nuclear umbrellas were packed and where only the DPRK remained as a 
nuclear vacuum zone was brought to an end. By the deterrence effect 
provided by the Republic’s possession of nuclear weapons, the danger of 
the outbreak of a war has noticeably reduced. This is precisely the 
effort made on the current stage to remove the nuclear threat not 
through pleas only in words but by deterring the United States’ nuclear 
weapons with our nuclear weapons.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> 3. DPRK’s Nuclear Policy</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 The position of the government of the Republic to establish a solid 
peace regime on the Korean peninsula and achieve denuclearization there 
remains unchanged.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> The denuclearization of the
 Korean peninsula — which was pointed out in the 19 September Joint 
Statement that the Six-Party Talks adopted and announced in 2005 — is 
the course of turning the entire Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free 
zone by completely removing in a verifiable manner the existing nuclear 
threat from outside to the Korean peninsula. Realizing denuclearization 
requires confidence-building. On the Korean peninsula, which is still in
 a state of the ceasefire, the sooner a peace agreement is concluded, 
the quicker the confidence necessary for denuclearization will be built.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 The mission of the nuclear forces of the DPRK is to deter and repel 
aggression and attack against the country and the nation until the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the world is realized. The 
DPRK is invariably maintaining the policy not to use nuclear weapons 
against non-nuclear states or threaten them with nuclear weapons as long
 as they do not join the act of invading or attacking us in conspiracy 
with nuclear weapons states.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> We are ready to 
join the international efforts for nuclear non-proliferation and for the
 safe management of nuclear materials on an equal footing with other 
nuclear weapons states.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> We will produce as 
many nuclear weapons as we need but will neither join the nuclear arms 
race nor produce more nuclear weapons than is necessary, and we will 
join the international efforts for nuclear disarmament on an equal 
footing with other nuclear weapons states.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> 
Regardless of whether the Six-Party Talks are resumed or not, the DPRK, 
as in the past, will continue to make a consistent effort in the future 
as well for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and in the rest
 of the world.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> [Dated] 21 April, chuch’e 99(2010)</p> <p class="rm-manual"> [Place] Pyongyang</p> <p class="rm-manual"> [Description of Source: Pyongyang KCNA in Korean — Official DPRK news agency; URL: <a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp%5D" rel="nofollow">http://www.kcna.co.jp]</a></p> </blockquote> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> FSB </p> <p class="rm-manual"> April 23, 2010 at 11:15 am </p> <p class="rm-manual">Shaeen,</p><p class="rm-manual">

 North Korea’s desire to be formally recognized as a nuclear weapon 
state are nothing new, yesterday’s document expresses these desires in a
 new context. The document suggests that North Korea’s external 
relations department have been keeping a close eye on the recent flurry 
of non-proliferation activity and news. Consequently it seems that North
 Korea has concluded that jumping on the non-proliferation bandwagon is 
now the best way for it to assert its nuclear weapon status.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 First – in the context of the recent Nuclear Security Summit, the 
Foreign Ministry’s call to ‘join the international efforts [on] nuclear 
non-proliferation and on nuclear material security’ can be read as an 
attempt to inject some credibility into the concept of North Korea as a 
responsible nuclear steward. A country that should be regarded on an 
equal footing with others in the nuclear ‘club’, that could presumably 
even contribute expertise to the next Nuclear Security Summit, to be 
held in 2012 in South Korea. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> Next, it seems 
the mostly positive international reaction to the U.S Nuclear Posture 
Review (NPR) has motivated North Korea to attempt to win similar praise.
 Thus the articulation of the ‘mission of the nuclear armed forces of 
the DPRK’, which describes Pyongyang’s arsenal largely in defensive 
terms, appears to be an overt attempt to emulate Washington’s mainly 
defensive posture. By going down this path, North Korea may be hoping to
 win some hearts and minds and be seen in a similarly responsible and 
non-aggressive light – characteristics it realizes are required in order
 to get the recognition it so desires. Note: It’s worth pointing out 
that Pyongyang didn’t catch up to Washington in one respect: It’s 
posture statement includes its own version of the so-called “Warsaw 
Pact” clause, which the U.S. NPR just ditched.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 Finally, North Korea’s PR people seem to have also picked up on the 
momentum surrounding the forthcoming NPT Review Conference as a way of 
aligning their nuclear status with that of the five recognized nuclear 
states. Indeed, part of the Memorandum is strongly reminiscent of the 
language and obligations found in Article VI of the NPT. Compare:</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 From North Korea’s posture memo: ‘[North Korea will] neither 
participate in [a] nuclear arms race nor produce more than it feels 
necessary… [And will] join the international nuclear disarmament 
efforts’</p><p class="rm-manual"> To:</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">
 And from Article VI of the NPT: ‘[Parties will pursue] effective 
measures relating to [the] cessation of the nuclear arms race at an 
early date and to nuclear disarmament.’</p> <p class="rm-manual"> This 
similar choice of language attempts to paint North Korea as an advocate 
for disarmament and as a responsible nuclear steward – again, no matter 
how incredible that might sound to some.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> In 
short, it appears the objective of this Memorandum is to present North 
Korea’s nuclear weapon status to the rest of the world as an irrefutable
 and justifiable fact, using the language and rationales traditionally 
used by the other nuclear weapon states (apart from Israel). Just like 
them, North Korea is now saying that it will keep nuclear weapons until 
‘they are eliminated from the peninsula and the rest of the world’. You 
could say imitation is the best form of flattery.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> (This is an excerpt from a blog I did on NOH in case you are wondering!)</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> anon </p> <p class="rm-manual"> April 24, 2010 at 12:39 pm </p> <p class="rm-manual">“ …North Korea’s nuclear weapon status to the rest of the world as an irrefutable and justifiable fact…” </p> <p class="rm-manual">

 What can South Korea do though? Go and launch a reprisal attack on the 
North? It would change nothing and actually just feed the regime with 
more excuses for the poor conditions there.</p><p class="rm-manual"> Its not in South Korea’s interest to prove that the DPRK was involved in this, it will put Lee Myung Bak in a tricky position.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> </li> </ol>
