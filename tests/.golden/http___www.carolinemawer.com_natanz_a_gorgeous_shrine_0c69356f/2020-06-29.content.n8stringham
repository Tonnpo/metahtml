<p class="rm-manual"> <span><a href="http://www.carolinemawer.com/natanz_a_gorgeous_shrine/" rel="bookmark">January 13, 2016January 13, 2016</a></span> <span>by <span><a href="http://www.carolinemawer.com/author/admin/" rel="author"><span>admin</span></a></span></span> </p>
<p>Many travellers stop at Natanz to see the gorgeous Ilkhanid (early 
14th century) façade. It’s one of the most spectacular sights in Iranian
 architecture, and it’s only an hour or so from Isfahan, on the way to 
Kashan. With its blend of glazed tile, stucco, and terra cotta it’s been
 described as a 3-D version of the best of Persian miniature paintings.</p>
<p>But the shrine in Natanz isn’t just about the sumptuous facade. The <a href="http://archnet.org/sites/1645">complex developed as a grave-tomb-shrine</a>
 after a shaykh in the Suharwardi Sufi order, ‘Abd al-Samad, died in 
Natanz in 1299. It is now recognised as one of the best preserved shrine
 complexes from the <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ilkh/hd_ilkh.htm">Ilkhanid era (1256–1353)</a>.</p>
<figcaption>The muqarnas semi-dome over the khanqah portal, Natanz. Image from Archnet</figcaption><p>As
 well as the tomb of ‘Abd al-Samad, there’s a four-iwan mosque, an 
octagonal sanctuary, a minaret, and a mosque from the 1930’s. To fit in 
the available space, these are squashed together, built at different 
floor levels, and sometimes overlapping. Because of that, and the fact 
that the complex was built (and rebuilt) over many centuries, it can 
sometimes be difficult to work out what you are seeing. This post aims 
to help with that.</p>
<p>It’s useful to start by looking at the façade west to east (left to right as you face it):</p>
<p>The western portal is what remains of an early fourteenth century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanqah">khanqah</a>
 – somewhere for Sufi travellers or students who wanted to stay at ‘Abd 
al-Samad’s shrine. This khanqah was destroyed and replaced by a mosque 
in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Behind the central arch of the Natanz façade there is a 37-metre 
minaret with an inscription dated AH725/1324-25AD. This was 
substantially restored in the 1970s</p>
<p>At the eastern end of the façade, there’s another portal, which acts 
as an entrance into the complex through a sunken narrow corridor. An 
inscription there says that the building is a mosque built by Zayn 
al-Din Mastari in AH704/1304-5AD.</p>
<figcaption>Muqarnas ceiling of the tomb in Natanz. Image: study blue</figcaption><p>As
 you walk down into and through the sunken corridor, you’ll come to a 
doorway into the tomb chamber. This has a glorious muqarnas ceiling – 
and the much less glorious remnants of a – now looted – tiled mihrab and
 walls. I’ve written more about this little room here.</p>
<p>When you go on, you will come into a square courtyard mosque with two
 storeys of rooms, linking four iwans. There are muqarnas in the north 
and south iwans. Linked to the south iwan is an octagonal sanctuary.</p>
<p>The restoration in the 1970s revealed that this sanctuary was 
originally a freestanding pavilion. It is much earlier than the 
courtyard mosque – as it is dated AH389/999AD. It may not look anywhere 
near as lovely as the facade, but it is the earliest dated example of an
 octagonal form in Iran. It was built open with columns, like the early 
tomb towers. Buyid tombs didn’t actually need to have a body buried 
within them – there are fascinating accounts of bodies being placed in 
glass coffins, suspended from the ceiling. The body of someone called 
Qabus was hung in a location where the early morning light struck it. In
 Natanz, like in other important Shia shrines, the pavilion was built to
 be walked around (the technical term is circumambulation). At Mecca, 
the qa’aba is walked around counterclockwise (seven times). At Natanz, 
pilgrims would have walked in the opposite direction: clockwise. The 
renowned art historian, Sheila Blair, has suggested that the pavilion 
was originally built as an imamzada or shrine for a descendant of the 
Prophet.</p>
<p>This is surely why the site is so jumbled – the early fourteenth 
century development followed on from an open, octagonal pavilion built 
three hundred years earlier.</p>
