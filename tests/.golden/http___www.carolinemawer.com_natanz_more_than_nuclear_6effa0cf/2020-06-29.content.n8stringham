<p class="rm-manual"> <span><a href="http://www.carolinemawer.com/natanz_more_than_nuclear/" rel="bookmark">January 13, 2016January 13, 2016</a></span> <span>by <span><a href="http://www.carolinemawer.com/author/admin/" rel="author"><span>admin</span></a></span></span> </p>
<p>Many travellers stop at Natanz on their way from Isfahan to Kashan. 
Of course, when you hear the word ‘Natanz’, most people think only of 
the Iranian nuclear enrichment controversy. But Natanz is also my most 
favourite small town in Iran, with some very special historic monuments.
 Please don’t miss seeing: the shrine; the monstrous plane trees; the 
Ilkanid mosque; the caravanserai; and the royal hawk pavilion.</p>
<p>First though, maybe you want a few words about the nuclear facilities
 in Natanz. These are the primary site for Iran’s gas centrifuge 
program. There are two primary facilities: the Pilot Fuel Enrichment 
Plant (PFEP) and the Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/Iran/irandeal.pdf">Comprehensive Nuclear Agreement</a>
 was signed by the P5+1 and Iranian negotiators on 2 April 2015. Under 
this, then for the next ten years the facility in Natanz will be the 
only place in Iran where uranium enrichment will take place. There will 
only be 5,060 of the less advanced, IR-1 first generation centrifuges. 
Iran’s more advanced centrifuge models (IR-2, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, and 
IR-8) will be placed under IAEA care for the duration of the agreement.</p>
<p>The agreement provides for “continuous monitoring” of the Natanz as 
well as Fordow facilities. Inspectors supposedly will have unfettered 
access to these facilities whenever necessary.</p>
<p>Much has been said about the <a href="http://www.iranintelligence.com/nukefacilities">Iranian nuclear programme</a>,
 but I think that the video here is pretty well balanced (unlike much 
Western media coverage!). It certainly presents the historical 
perspective better than most reports. It has some really interesting 
points – including details of the pre-Revolutionary nuclear agreements. I
 didn’t previously know that Iran currently owns 10% of FRENCH. I was 
surprised to see Tony Benn in the video. He’s here in his guise as 
Energy Minister at the time of the last Shah. But he also underlines 
Iran’s absolute right to a civil nuclear programme, as part of the 
discussion of how the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has been applied 
to Iran.</p>
<p>The Natanz facility is specifically mentioned in the video – and 
shown at 35.40 as clearly visible from the road. This contradicts the 
reports of its absolute secrecy.</p>
<p>While there is some discussion of the need for a balanced and 
long-term energy policy in Iran then, sadly, there’s no mention anywhere
 of the potential of cheap solar power in Iran. Solar would be even 
easier in sunny Iran than elsewhere in the world!</p>

<p>But please remember that Natanz is not only about nuclear facilities!</p>
