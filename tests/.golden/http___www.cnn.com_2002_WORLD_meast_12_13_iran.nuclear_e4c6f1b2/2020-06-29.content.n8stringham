</tbody></table> <p> WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States accused Iran 
Friday of "actively working" on a nuclear weapons program and said that 
recent satellite photographs of a massive nuclear power construction 
project "reinforce" that belief. </p> <p> State Department spokesman 
Richard Boucher said two facilities seen in the photographs "are not 
justified by the needs of Iran's civilian nuclear program." </p> <p> 
"There is no economic gain for a state that's rich in oil and gas like 
Iran to build costly nuclear fuel cycle facilities," he said. "I point 
out that Iran flares more gas annually than the equivalent energy its 
desired reactors would produce." </p> <p> Boucher added: "We've reached the conclusion that Iran is actively working to develop nuclear weapons capability." </p> <p>
 But International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Mohamed 
ElBaradei, in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, said the 
chief of Iran's atomic energy program had told him in September that the
 construction was for a 6,000-megawatt nuclear power facility. </p> <p> 
Gholamreza Aghazadeh also said that Iran planned to declare the 
facilities to the IAEA and would welcome IAEA safeguards, according to 
ElBaradei. </p> <p> The Iranians invited ElBaradei to bring an 
inspection team to look at the sites, but a visit scheduled for this 
week was postponed until February by Iranian authorities. </p> <p> U.S. 
officials told CNN Thursday that the United States had evidence Iran had
 been secretly constructing large nuclear facilities that could possibly
 be used to make nuclear weapons and that the IAEA had not been able to 
visit them. </p> <p> Commercial satellite photographs taken in September
 and obtained by CNN show the construction near the town of Natanz and 
another near Arak within Iran, one of three countries President Bush has
 labeled an "axis of evil." (<a href="">View map</a>) </p> <p> "The 
circumstances are fairly interesting and lead to the conclusion ... that
 this nuclear program in Iran is not peaceful and certainly is not 
transparent," Boucher said. </p> <p> Iranian officials disputed the charge. </p> <p>
 "I can categorically tell you that Iran does not have a nuclear weapons
 program," said Mohammed Javad Zarif, Iran's ambassador to the United 
Nations. </p> <table><tbody><tr><td> <table> <tbody><tr> <td><p> Commercial satellite photo of a nuclear facility near Natanz, Iran </p></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </td></tr></tbody></table> <p>
 Iran has one publicly declared nuclear program at Bushehr -- what its 
government says is used solely for peaceful purposes, to produce 
electricity. </p> <p> "Iran hasn't committed any acts that can be 
considered against international rules, and will not do so in the 
future," Hamid Reza Assefi, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign 
Ministry, told CNN. "At the same time, no country could, for its own 
political objectives, prevent Iran from achieving its own goals." </p> <p>
 "This kind of publicity is not new," he said. "Certain circles within 
the United States are trying to create tensions and poison the 
international atmosphere, and to avert international public opinions 
away from the real regional danger, which is Israel." </p> <p> Boucher 
said the two facilities "reinforce our already grave concern that Iran 
is seeking technology to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons." </p> <table> <tbody><tr><td> <table> <tbody><tr> <td>

commissioned the satellite photographs after an Iranian opposition group
 talked about the construction at a news conference in August, ElBaradei
 said Friday. </p> <p> "We saw them, we asked the Iranians about them, and they said, 'yes,' and invited us to visit," he said. </p> <p>
 "I wouldn't say it was 'weird' " that Iran had not at that time 
notified the agency of the construction, he added, "but it would be nice
 if they had told us earlier." </p> <p> "The suspect uranium enrichment 
plant, for example, could be used to produce highly enriched uranium for
 weapons," he said. "The heavy water plant could support a reactor for 
producing weapons grade plutonium." </p> <p> The facilities near Natanz 
and Arak are of particular interest to the agency and will be part of 
the February visit, IAEA spokesman Mark Gwozdecky said. </p> <p> 
"Everybody's looking at the same satellite photos," he said, "and 
they're consistent with the facilities being alleged -- one is a heavy 
water plant and the other a uranium-enrichment facility." </p> <p> "But 
that's not the end of the story either," he added. "Iran is entitled to 
have these facilities as long as it declares them to us and allows us to
 put them under our safeguards." </p> <p class="rm-manual"> CNN Senior
