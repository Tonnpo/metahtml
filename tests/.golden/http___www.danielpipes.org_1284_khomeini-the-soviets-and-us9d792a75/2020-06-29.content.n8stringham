 â€“ Iran appears to be drifting into the Soviet orbit. While the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has fulminated often and loudly against a 
satanic United States, he has rarely condemned the Soviet assault on 
Afghanistan. His support of the continued holding of the 53 American 
hostages has led Western countries to cut some economic ties with Iran, 
forcing that country to depend more on trade with the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Why
 does Khomeini alienate the United States, the one country that can 
protect him from the Soviet Union? Westerners, unable to answer this 
question, throw up their hands in despair and declare Khomeini 
irrational. But this is glib. Khomeini is not crazy; rather, he 
represents the Islamic tradition in Iranian culture and his actions make
 sense in the context of that tradition.</p> <p>In the Western view, the
 Soviet Union threatens Iran far more than does the United States: It 
looms across a long common border and espouse an atheistic doctrine 
incompatible with Islam and many other institutions of Iranian life, 
such as private property and the family unit as an ideal.</p> <p>But for
 the Ayatollah, it is America that is more threatening. He believes that
 after 1953, the United States Government controlled the Shah and his 
regime and the Iranian people; further, he believes that Washington is 
trying to overthrow him and regain its old power. The failed rescue 
mission [in April 1980] confirmed this fear.</p> <p>It is American, not 
Soviet culture, that pervades Iran and horrifies Ayatollah Khomeini by, 
in his view, endangering the Islamic way of life with its loose ways 
(alcohol, jeans, pop music, nightclubs, movies, dancing, mixed bathing, 
pornography), with its conspicuous consumption, and with foreign 
ideologies (such as nationalism and liberalism). He and his followers 
fervently want an Iran free of foreign domination. So long as they 
perceive America as the greatest threat to Iran, nothing prevents them 
from relying on the Soviet Union. Although we share with the Iranians a 
respect for religion, private property and the family unit, the 
Ayatollah's regime also shares much with the Marxists against the West.</p> <p>For
 one thing, they both feel considerable antipathy toward the West. The 
Soviet Government, like Khomeini, worries about the allure of Western 
culture and tries desperately to contain it.</p> <p>In an odd parallel, 
Islam claims to replace Christianity as the final revelation from God, 
and Communism claims to succeed capitalism as the final stage of 
economic evolution. The West infuriates both its would-be successors 
with its continued wealth and power. They respond by presenting the West
 with its most sustained opposition. Just as earlier in this century 
they led the attack on European imperialism, today the Soviet Union and 
Moslem members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are 
mounting the main challenge to Western political and economic power. 
Both have revolutionary temperaments; claiming a monopoly on truth, why 
should either allow imperfect or evil ways to exist for another day? 
Each propagates its message with rhetorical shrillness, indoctrination, 
biased law courts and firing squads. Both tend not to tolerate dissent 
and regard nonbelievers with suspicion, emphasizing the deep gulf 
between themselves and outsiders.</p> <p>Activist Islam and Marxism 
emphasize international solidarity over nationalism, community needs 
over those of the individual, egalitarianism over freedom.</p> <p>Both 
engage in social engineering â€“ this is the most important 
consideration. Scorning the modest goals and realistic expectations of 
liberalism, activist Moslems and Marxists pursue noble-sounding yet 
unattainable standards for society. For example, Islam forbids interest 
on money, and Communism denounces profits, yet commercial life requires 
both.</p> <p>Finally, because activist Islam and Marxism touch on every aspect of life, their governments incline toward totalitarianism.</p> <p>While
 Khomeini shares ideological elements with both the United States and 
the Soviet Union, as a devout Moslem he believes in the superiority of 
his own creed and execrates both alternatives. In the end, however, 
ideologies cancel out and Khomeini aligns Iranian foreign relations in 
accordance with his hopes and fears, not on the basis of theoretical 
affinities.</p> <p>At present, Khomeini fears the United States more 
than the Soviet Union: The Russians are near but for him America is 
already within Iran. Our culture, not the Russians', has been 
undermining the Moslem way of life in Iran for decades. So long as these
 fears remain paramount, Ayatollah Khomeini and his followers can be 
expected to veer Iran toward the Soviet Union, for its ideology appears 
no worse to him than does our own.</p> <p>To the Editor:</p> <p>Daniel 
Pipes (Op-Ed May 27) tells us that it is American, not Soviet, culture 
that horrifies Khomeini, endangering the Islamic way of life with 
alcohol, jeans, pop music, nightclubs, movies, dancing, mixed bathing 
and pornography (all of which is now part of Soviet culture as well).</p> <p>But
 is the list illustrative or exclusive? What about junk food, and what 
about the automobile, which has cluttered the streets of Teheran? If 
Khomeini is against that, then I would say he is not so crazy after all.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Ralph Slovenko</p><p class="rm-manual"> Professor of Law and Psychiatry</p><p class="rm-manual"> Wayne State University</p><p class="rm-manual"> Detroit, May 28, 1980</p><p></p> <p></p> <p class="rm-manual">Related Topics: <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/topics/10/iran">Iran</a>, <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/topics/37/russia-soviet-union">Russia/Soviet Union</a>, <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/topics/44/views-of-us-the-west">Views of US &amp; the West</a></p> <p class="rm-manual">Related Articles:</p> <ul> <li class="rm-manual"><a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2012/06/iranians-america-but">Iranians â™¥ America, But ...</a></li> <li class="rm-manual"><a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2009/04/bibliography-my-writings-on-left-right-and-islamists">Bibliography â€“ My Writings on Left, Right, and Islamists</a></li> <li class="rm-manual"><a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/4148/the-islamic-revolts-threat-to-the-soviets">The Islamic revolt's threat to the Soviets</a></li> </ul> <p class="rm-manual">receive the latest by email: subscribe to daniel pipes' free <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/list_subscribe.php">mailing list</a></p> <p class="rm-manual">The
