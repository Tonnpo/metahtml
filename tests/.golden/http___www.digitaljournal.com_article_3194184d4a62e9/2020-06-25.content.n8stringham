Beloved Successor of Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea Kim Jong Un 
dead from dying after assassin kill. No verification. Checking. </p> <p>OK, let's not get all <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/02/05/republican-candidate-airs-racially-charged-debbie-spenditnow-ad-during-super-bowl/">"Debbie Spenditnow"</a>
 here... but the Chinese microblogging community is all agog over rumors
 about the alleged assassination of Kim Jong-un, the recently installed 
latest "Dear Leader" of North Korea, a promotion occasioned by the 
convenient death of long-time dictator Kim Jong-il, who became dictator 
of that reclusive nation after the convenient death of his father and 
the nation's founder, Kim Il-sung. Google Translate doesn't do that good
 of a job with Chinese, but let's see what they're saying on the <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=s.weibo.com%2Fweibo%2F%2525E9%252587%252591%2525E6%2525AD%2525A3%2525E6%252581%2525A9%3Ftopnav%3D1&amp;act=url">microblog</a>.

Gracious! What else? "Minus 8 Degrees of Ice" shares... @ Bari 
Commentary : # live # bustling among Korea, the friends did not forget 
the "old friend": jinzhengen was assassinated and killed at 2:45 on the 
10th. A slip of the circle of Korean media and foreign media, no 
relevant reports, should not the real news. February 16 Kim Jong-il 
70-year-old birthday "Light Star Festival", the DPRK embassy some 
"changes" is not surprising. The recent news is that the Korean Central 
News Agency reported that on the 8th jinzhengen inspection of 324 
troops. <a href="http://t.cn/zOwhO2S">http://t.cn/zOwhO2S</a> That link 
takes you to the South Korean Yonhap News Agency, which doesn't say a 
word about Kim Jong-un going belly-up. Someone called "ByeJeff Peak 
Dance Wine Days" says: North Korea may be a military coup] North Korean 
official media for four consecutive days supreme leader jinzhengen, any 
news reports, rumors of little-known middle-ranking officers Park Bend 
Colonel has been in control of the situation, and has occupied the 
station. JinZhengen seems to be Chinese for Kim Jong-un. See? We learned
 something new. This seems to be the latest poop. Phoenix Video: 
microblogging hot] Korea councils dynamic has suddenly become the hot 
microblogging. According to various sources, the current situation of 
North Korean leader jinzhengen and vehicles in and out of the Korean 
Embassy, there is no official news. A proven News @ Phoenix video 
publishing the first time, please pay attention! Okey doke. Let's check 
the western media and see what's what. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/02/believing-the-unbelievable-why-kim-jong-un-death-rumors-wont-die/252938/">The Atlantic Magazine</a>
 looked into the rumor and concluded: Is it possible that Kim's death 
really happened? Of course it is. This is North Korea; anything is 
possible. Is it credible? As of this moment, no. I and some Atlantic and
 Atlantic Wire colleagues tried to find the slightest suggestion of 
truth, or even the possibility of truth, and found nothing. With 
evidence so thin and so many reasons to believe that the story is 
nonsense, why have American readers and writers taken it so seriously? 
What has led -- is still leading -- so many people to not just believe 
this rumor but pass it on? Well, when in doubt, go to the source. In 
this case, t<a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-k.htm">he official news agency of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea</a>,
 the same agency that waited 51 hours to inform the world of Kim 
Jong-il's heart attack and death. Here's the top news... in Korean.
