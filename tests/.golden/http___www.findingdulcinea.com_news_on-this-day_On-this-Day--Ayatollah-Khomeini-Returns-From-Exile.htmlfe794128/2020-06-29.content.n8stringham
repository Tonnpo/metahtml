<p class="rm-manual">Campion/AP Ayatollah Khomeini, center, waves to 
followers as he appears on the balcony of his headquarters in Tehran, 
Feb. 2, 1979, the second day of his return from exile.</p>
<h1 class="rm-manual">On This Day: Ayatollah Khomeini Returns From Exile</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> February 01, 2011 06:00 AM </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> by findingDulcinea Staff </p>
<p class="rm-manual">On Feb. 1, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini arrived in Iran to a welcoming crowd, ending 15 years in exile.</p>
<h2> <a href="#0">Khomeini Comes Back to Iran</a> </h2>
<p> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/khomeini_ayatollah.shtml">Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was forced out of Iran in 1964</a>
 after repeatedly lambasting the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Shah 
Pahlavi, for his Westernization measures and ties to the United States 
and Israel. While in exile in France, <a href="http://wsu.edu/~dee/SHIA/REV.HTM">the Ayatollah fomented opposition against the Shah</a>, calling for general strikes, and turning public opinion in his favor.</p>
<p> As a result, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/16/newsid_2530000/2530475.stm">the Shah fled Iran on Jan. 16, 1979</a>,
 amid an increasingly restive Iranian population. He appointed Prime 
Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar to take control of the provisional 
government. </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920102,00.html">Khomeini returned to Tehran by plane on Feb. 1</a>.
 “After 15 years in exile, Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini. 78, spiritual 
leader of a revolution that has been building to a frightening climax, 
had come home at last,” wrote Time. “The moment was, conceivably, the 
start of a new era for a country that has seemed dangerously out of 
control.”</p>
<p> Khomeini then traveled from the airport to a nearby cemetery where 
many martyrs of the revolution were buried. Millions of his supporters 
lined to route to cheer his name, and hundreds of thousands gathered at 
the cemetery to hear him speak. </p>

<p> “<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/revolution/khomeini.shtml#01">I must tell you that Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, that evil traitor, has gone</a>.
 … We are saying this man, his government, his Majlis are all illegal. 
If they were to continue to stay in power, we would treat them as 
criminals and would try them as criminals,” Khomeini declared. “I shall 
appoint my own government. I shall slap this government in the mouth. I 
shall determine the government with the backing of this nation, because 
this nation accepts me.”</p>
<p class=""> Over the next 10 days, <a href="http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch29ir3.htm">Khomeini and Bakhtiar vied for control of the government</a>.
 Khomeini appointed his own prime minister, Mehdi Bazargan, and public 
revolts spread throughout the country. Weakened by the uprisings, 
Bakhtiar’s government was dealt its final blow on Feb. 11 when the 
military declared itself neutral, allowing the revolutionaries to take 
control. </p>

<p> The government <a href="http://www.ketabeqom.net/index.php/page,otherEn.STextFajr/scid,458/fatherid,458">published the new Iranian constitution on Nov. 15, 1979</a>,
 concentrating power in the hands of the unelected Supreme Religious 
Leader. Khomeini’s power grab drew much protest, which the Ayatollah 
answered by subduing his opposition. “By early summer 1980 all political
 groups opposing the government had to go underground,” according to 
Persian cultural scholar Mohammad Mehdi Korrami.</p>
<p> However, Khomeini’s political suppression was soon overshadowed by two events. First, in November 1979, <a href="http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/November/On-this-Day--Iran-Hostage-Crisis-Begins.html">Iranians took 52 Americans hostage</a>
 in retaliation for the Shah taking medical refuge in the United States.
 The following year saw skirmishes between Iran and Saddam Hussein’s 
Iraq <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/293527/Iran-Iraq-War">escalate into the Iran-Iraq war</a>. The war lasted eight years and resulted in massive Iranian casualties and financial burdens. </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/12806/timeline.html">U.S.-Iranian relations since the Islamic Revolution</a>
 have “been sporadic and marred by mutual distrust and debacles,” 
according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The hostage crisis of 
1979-80, in which the Iranians held 52 Americans, was one of the first 
events to indicate that the U.S. relationship with the new Khomeini 
regime would be an unpleasant one. </p>
<h2> <a href="#2">Biography: Ayatollah Khomeini</a> </h2>
<p> <a href="http://www.iranchamber.com/history/rkhomeini/ayatollah_khomeini.php">Ayatollah Khomeini was raised with the teachings of Islamic religious tradition</a>,
 and went on to become the “Supreme Leader” of Iran. The Iran Chamber 
Society’s biography of Ayatollah Khomeini states that “he did not 
fulfill his pre-revolution promises to the people of Iran but instead he
 started to marginalize ... the opposition groups and those who opposed 
the clerical rules.” </p>
