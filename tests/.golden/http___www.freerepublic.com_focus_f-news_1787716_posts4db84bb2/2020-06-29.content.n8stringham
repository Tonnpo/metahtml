<p class="rm-manual"> <span>ISRAELI AIR RAID ON NATANZ, ISFAHAN SHORTLY </span></p>
<p class="rm-manual">by B. Raman </p>
<p>The US and Israel----acting separately and in tandem--- have started 
stepping up psychological pressure on Iran. This PSYWAR campaign is 
directed at countering Iran's exploitation of the difficulties faced by 
the US in Iraq in order to advance its own agenda and to prevent any US 
intervention in Iran and to convey a message to the Iranian public that 
Iran will pay a heavy price if President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad continues 
to defy the international community over its concerns regarding the real
 purpose of its acquiring an uranium enrichment capability. </p>
<p>2. This PSYWAR campaign has so far taken the following forms: </p>
<ul> <li>The recent US detention and questioning of two Iranian 
diplomats posted in Iraq on their role in assisting the Shia extremist 
groups. </li>
<li>The stepped-up US rhetoric on the devious game being played by the 
Iranian intelligence in Iraq by assisting the illegal Shia militias as 
well as pro-Al Qaeda Sunni extremist elements. </li>
<li>The well-publicised authorisation by President George Bush of covert
 action against Iranians posing a threat to American lives and interests
 in Iraq. </li>
<li>The beginning of an operation mounted by MOSSAD, the Israeli 
external intelligence agency, to eliminate senior Iranian nuclear 
scientists. The Sunday Times of London reported on February 4, 2007, as 
follows: "A prize-winning Iranian nuclear scientist has died in 
mysterious circumstances, according to Radio Farda, which is funded by 
the US State Department and broadcasts to Iran. An intelligence source 
suggested that Ardeshire Hassanpour, 44, a nuclear physicist, had been 
assassinated by Mossad, the Israeli security service. Hassanpour worked 
at a plant in Isfahan where uranium hexafluoride gas is produced. The 
gas is needed to enrich uranium in another plant at Natanz which has 
become the focus of concerns that Iran may be developing nuclear 
weapons. According to Radio Farda, Iranian reports of Hassanpour’s death
 emerged on January 21 after a delay of six days, giving the cause as 
“gas poisoning”. The Iranian reports did not say how or where Hassanpour
 was poisoned, but his death was said to have been announced at a 
conference on nuclear safety. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is expected 
to announce next Sunday — the 28th anniversary of the Islamic revolution
 — that 3,000 centrifuges have been installed at Natanz, enabling Iran 
to move closer to industrial scale uranium enrichment. Inspectors from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency say that hundreds of technicians 
and labourers have been “working feverishly” to assemble equipment at 
the plant." </li>
<li>Stepping up of broadcasts and telecasts to Iran by radio stations and TV channels funded by the US and run by Iranian exiles. </li>
<li>The movement of additional US naval ships, including another 
aircraft-carrier, to the Gulf and the designation by Bush of a senior 
naval officer (Admiral William Fallon) to head the US Central Command, 
which is responsible for operations in West Asia. In the past, a US Army
 officer had headed the Central Command. </li>
</ul>
<p>3. The US had seen in North Korea what happens if it avoids action in
 response to pressure from other countries co-operating with the US. 
North Korea has carried out a nuclear test and is now insisting that any
 agreement it signs with the US and other powers would be as a nuclear 
power and not as a non-nuclear power. It is reportedly prepared to 
discuss a freezing of its military nuclear capability at its present 
level, but not its winding-up. The US and Israel----Israel even more 
than the US--- are determined to prevent a similar scenario in Iran. The
 price of inaction will be prohibitively high for Israel, endangering 
its future. </p>
<p>4.The US Congressional opinion---now dominated by the Democrats-- is 
strongly opposed to Bush's Iraq policy. Its views on his Iran policy are
 much more nuanced. The likely opinion of the Jewish voters in the US on
 the Iraq policy at the time of next year's Presidential elections would
 not be that important for the Presidential aspirants, but it would be 
in the case of Iran's nuclear designs. One could see evidence of it in 
the recent statements of Senator Hillary Clinton. She is not in favour 
of direct US military intervention in Iran, but at the same time she 
does not want to rule out the military option, should the worst comes to
 the worst. </p>
<p>5. After a visit to the US in February last year, I had reported that
 there were three groups there---- one group was totally opposed to any 
intervention in Iran. A second group urged intervention by the US before
 it became too late. The third group favoured intervention by Israel 
with a US wink, without Washington getting directly involved. The third 
group seems to have won the debate. </p>
<p>6. Action to stop the acquisition of a military nuclear capability by
 Iran is vital for Israel's security and very survival. The repeated 
anti-Israel and anti-Jewish statements of President Ahmadinejad make it 
all the more important for Israel to disrupt, if not destroy, Iran's 
nuclear plans. For Israel, the question is not whether Iran has the 
intention to acquire a military nuclear capability. The question is 
should Iran be allowed to have an infrastructure capable of being used 
for military nuclear purposes even if it does not have the intention at 
present to use it for military purposes. Once it is allowed to have the 
infrastructure, any time---clandestinely and at short notice--- it would
 be able to acquire a military nuclear capability and confront Israel 
with a nuclear fait accompli. </p>
<p>7. Israel is determined not to allow this scenario to develop. Two 
elements of Iran's existing infrastructure are key in this regard---the 
uranium hexafluoride plant at Isfahan and the uranium enrichment plant 
at Natanz. Raiding and destroying or seriously damaging them would be a 
more complex operation than the Israeli raid on the French-aided Osirak 
reactor in Iraq in the early 1980s. Osirak had not yet been 
commissioned. The French engineers collaborated with Israel by keeping 
away from the reactor site at the time of the raid. </p>
<p>8. Natanz and Isfahan are facilities, which have already been 
completed and are already in the production mode. There is a greater 
risk of heavy human casualties and possible environmental damage than 
there was in Osirak. Iran is a strong military power, with an ability to
 retaliate against Israel. Iraq of Saddam Hussein was not in the early 
1980s. Moreover, it had got involved in a military confrontation with 
Iran. Israel did not have to pay a price for the Osirak raid. There is a
 risk that it may have to if it raids Isfahan and Natanz. </p>
<p>9. Israelis have a reputation of not allowing fears of likely 
consequences deter any action by them which they consider necessary for 
their security and survival. An Israeli air strike on Natanz and Isfahan
 is very likely sooner than later. Things have started moving in that 
direction. The accumulation of US forces in the region is meant to deter
 any Iranian retaliation. Israel hopes Iran will not be unwise enough to
 retaliate. If it does, Israel is prepared for it. Israel is confident 
of its ability to take on Iran----even if Teheran instigates the 
Hezbollah to step up attacks on Israel from the Lebanon. </p>
<p>10. It would be suicidal for Iran to think that the painful 
experience of the US in Iraq and of Israel in the Lebanon in July last 
year has weakened their will to resort to military action, if they 
consider it necessary in their national interests. It has not. </p>

<p class="rm-manual">It's called PSYOPS .. and people use it all the time in war. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Plus .. it's used to frighten the enemy into making false moves .. or excited moves which can end up being big mistakes. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">And .. believe me .. the real attack plans will not be made public. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">But .. I figured something was up when the USS 
Ronald Reagan made a quick turnaround and headed back to the gulf. 
Actually, I was surprised they announced it .. but maybe that was part 
of the PSYOPS plan too.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">one way to definitively take it out is with a specops team on the ground. an isolated installation could be taken given </p>
<p class="rm-manual">enough air support. the team could assure destruction </p>
<p class="rm-manual">using ADMs, MOABs or mass quantities of plastique planted </p>
<p class="rm-manual">inside the chamber. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">seyeret matkal, for example.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> Double hits in the same hole with ground 
penetrators guided by on the ground laser designators would do the 
trick, provided that the target layoout info. was accurate.</p>
