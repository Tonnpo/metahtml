<p>From Egypt's order that all 300,000 pigs in the country be 
slaughtered to travel bans and putting the kibosh on kissing, the world 
is taking drastic — and some say debatable — measures to combat swine 
flu. </p>
<p>Egypt ordered the pig slaughter even though there hasn't been a 
single case of swine flu there and no evidence that pigs have spread the
 disease. Britain, with only five cases, is trying to buy 32 million 
masks. And in the United States, President Barack Obama said more of the
 country's 132,000 schools may have to be shuttered. </p>
<p>At airports from Japan to South Korea to Greece and Turkey, thermal 
cameras were trained on airline passengers to see if any were feverish. 
And Lebanon discouraged traditional Arab peck-on-the-cheek greetings, 
even though no one has come down with the virus there... </p>
<p>In Germany, where officials confirmed three cases, Lufthansa 
announced that starting Thursday it will put a doctor aboard all flights
 to Mexico, the epicenter of the outbreak. </p>
<p>Experts said that makes sense: The doctors will be able to field 
questions from uneasy passengers and tend to anyone who might fall ill. </p>
<p>The World Health Organization said total bans on travel to Mexico — 
such as one imposed by Argentina, which hasn't had any confirmed cases —
 were questionable because the virus is already fairly widespread. </p>
<p>Roselyne Bachelot, France's health minister, said she would ask the 
European Union to suspend all flights to Mexico at a meeting Thursday in
 Luxembourg. </p>
<p>Travel bans were effective during the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Asia, 
because that illness can be transmitted only by people who already show 
symptoms. With flu, by contrast, the incubation period ranges from 24 
hours to four days, meaning people often are infectious before they have
 symptoms...</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Closing schools but leaving the border to Mexico 
open is stupid. The only way to effectively contain disease is to 
quarantine those who are sick. In this case, the State Dept. needs to 
ban travel to Mexico until the outbreak has ended since it is Americans 
who have visited Mexico who are bringing the swine flu here.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Unfortunately, it is already here. Travel bans and 
closing the border will do nothing to prevent the flu spreading further 
here. However, I think we should continue to push for closing the border
 for other reasons!</p>

<p class="rm-manual">“Unfortunately, it is already here.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">With all due respect, just what is “already here?”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The usual daily hysterical lies about something new
 invented every other day or bring up something old again if the first 
time it didn’t stick?</p>
<p class="rm-manual">THERE IS NO PANDEMIC FLU.</p>

 will all still be alive...if we remember to tell you to come out.</p>
