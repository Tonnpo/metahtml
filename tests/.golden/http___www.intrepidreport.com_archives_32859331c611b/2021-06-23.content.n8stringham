<h1 class="rm-manual">The capitalist pandemic, the assault on consciousness, and America’s status as chosen people of the planet</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> By Frank Scott</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span>Posted on</span> <a href="http://www.intrepidreport.com/archives/32859" rel="bookmark"><span>June 23, 2021</span></a> <span><span>by</span> <span><a href="http://www.intrepidreport.com/archives/author/frank-scott/">Frank Scott</a></span></span> </p>
<p>The new CEO fronting for America Inc. completed his first meeting 
among our Euro lapdogs—officially known as NATO—and had a more important
 meeting with Putin in which, according to media servants of market 
forces, he let him know who’s boss of the universe. Politely, of course,
 because even this glorified clerk understands the danger of provoking a
 world war which would spare few of us if any. An unedited interview of 
the Russian president, available online if American authorities of 
freedom and democracy haven’t already removed it, clearly reveals the 
infantile ignorance of a network assailant posing as objective reporter 
and the often amused reactions of the Russian statesman and leader of a 
nation once hanging on the ropes under the abuse of global capital now a
 world power again and much of that due to his leadership. It, like so 
many other examples, glaringly highlights the descent of the American 
empire with little global power remaining but its ability to blow up 
earth and commit mass murder more effectively than any other nation. But
 it is also susceptible to almost as much horror as it might inflict on 
powerless nations by powerful nations now able to retaliate in kind, 
which we can all be thankful for since it’s the only thing stopping us 
from attempted greater slaughters than we already conduct which we sell 
as advancing the cause of peace and democracy.</p>
<p>While the corona virus has created a menace seemingly beyond what was
 already becoming obvious about the end of private profit domination of 
earth, it also unleashed the greatest outpouring of high, low and no IQ 
speculation, charges, countercharges and more surpassing past reactions 
at times of great crisis with moments of extreme fantasy bordering on 
dementia being experienced and practiced both by people of supposed 
expertise and higher education in the sciences to folks who may still 
dance under a full moon with their bodies covered in slime as a way to 
avoid cancer. Sadly, so far, the slime-covered dancers are making about 
as much sense as the allegedly more critical gang.</p>
<p>The horrendous death toll inflicted by the virus is thought by many 
to be the work of a Chinese plot to exterminate everyone on earth but 
the Chinese and blame it on America, an American plot to exterminate 
everyone on earth but Americans and blame it on China, and assorted 
tales of twitness and omni-anti-social media to make those two sound 
relatively thoughtful. The fact that capitalism has transformed nature 
and made it far more easy to spread a lethal virus than to feed, clothe 
and shelter billions of people has escaped many, even some critics of 
capital who seem shocked that big pharma profits from illness. Hello? As
 does every and all other business entities and aspects of free market 
private profit pursuit which has less to do with evil individuals and 
far more to do with a corrupt debased system controlled by minorities at
 ever great cost to the majority. Dog food, bombs, broccoli, burgers, 
health food, high fashion, health care, garbage, death and every other 
aspect of life are all subject to market forces creating private profit 
at the mall, school, factory, lab, convenience store and all other 
venues where goods are exchanged by one and all except for those without
 enough market force, and they can just drop dead.</p>
<p>And this is only a small part of the dis-mis-cis mind attacks on the 
population to assure mass confusion that doesn’t notice billions the 
world over, and hundreds of thousands in America, unable to afford food 
clothing and shelter while a relatively tiny number increase their 
wealth to become the equal of gods while their subjects cringe at 
threats to what is called “our” democracy originating from people with 
little to no political economic power save to vote for candidates mostly
 bought, rented and leased by the richest of the rich who look down on 
them lined up at the polls, malls and battlefields from their wealth 
created mountain-top fortresses and smile at the blessings of capitalist
 democracy.</p>
<p>What’s a failing empire to do but continue failing, as in rushing to 
increase aid to Israel when a global majority has reacted in critical 
anger over it’s most recent abuse of the indigenous people whose land 
was taken on behalf of Europeans and the Palestinians were made to pay 
and are still paying for European atrocities? While the new American CEO
 leads a struggle to return to a form of social democracy that spreads a
 few more loans among the barely surviving and more taco-pizza-burgers 
to the fast food hungry while assuring that the system responsible for 
creating hunger is maintained and billions of American tax dollars 
continue to be rewarded to a colonial apartheid nation? And this while 
decent Americans in great numbers are enraged by the conditions of life 
of America’s indigenous people robbed of their land, culture and 
heritage long before Israel or the Middle East occupied any of the 
consciousness of Americans.</p>
<p>Confusing?</p>
<p>Like the humanitarian decency at the root of all Americans when 
reaching out to immigrant populations having the usual difficulties of 
discrimination inflicted first by their cheap labor exploiters and later
 by the native people whose jobs they take and at whose expense they 
frequently survive. Not to mention the difficulty of having to step over
 the bodies of Americans reduced to sleeping in the street while on our 
way to rescue an animal to save it from, um, having to sleep in the 
street. Are we confused? Does a snake have wings? Is a bluebird blue?</p>
<p>Of course all of these systemic curses of inhumanity and often near 
madness can be written off as Russian and Chinese assault on our sacred 
democracy, enshrined in the constitution-bible written by slave owners 
and others of the 1% who believed the common people should leave the 
important business of ruling to those with the most money, purchased 
knowledge and sanctification by those biblical gifts handed down—or 
up?—by an invisible force called god, or later, high finance.</p>
<p>The financialization of capitalism has cursed the world with worse 
contradictions than existed in the time of the system’s birth when Marx 
pointed out most of them. Now, money makes money without the production 
of anything but more money which may soon lead to much of humanity with 
indoor toilets eating bitcoins and excreting buttcoins while trying to 
live with junk filled oceans, overflowing sewers and forests turned to 
deserts while praying that nobody pushes the nuclear button. On the 
hopeful side, workers here and all over the world are acting up, 
unionizing and fighting for democracy in political economic 
dictatorships worshipped as democracies by Wall Street and its wholly 
owned subsidiary: the American government.</p>
<p>Time is growing short for Americans to get beyond symbolic challenges
 to capitalism that merely offer more profits by “branding” various 
movements with marketplace stature assuring that Gay Inc., Feminist 
Inc., Black Lives Matter Inc., and Latino-a-x Inc. do not, perish the 
thought, turn into American Democracy Inc. That is still to come and as 
always, we’d better hurry to join up with much of the world our media 
mind managers don’t tell us about but which is setting an example for 
everyone by opting for a system that puts the public good before private
 profit. So far, as expected, the American regime of warfare, petcare 
and egomaniacal behavior personified by Trump – which is why they had to
 get rid of him for exemplifying what the nation really is – has 
succeeded in keeping division, individual mental illness and group 
therapy uppermost in consciousness while social reality sinks more 
deeply into a massive sea of moral sewage.</p>
<p>The “memes” of an all too often me-me-me-me culture need to and will 
soon become a plural “we “encompassing all of us and leaving no one out.
 Capitalism cannot be saved but humanity must be, from the social 
pandemic of private profit first, humanity later, if ever. The viral 
brain surgery performed on our collective consciousness by our rulers is
 an aspect of capitalism and could not exist without market forces under
 minority and anti-democratic control. The sooner “we” understand that, 
the sooner “we” end pandemics and thought control on our way to real 
democracy in a collective human environment favoring the best for all 
and leaving no one out.</p>
<p>You gotta problem with that?</p>
