Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Org Why our president did it – and why he

<p class="rm-manual"> Posted By <a href="http://www.ruthfullyyours.com/author/admin/" rel="author">Ruth King</a> on April 9th, 2019 </p>

<p>President Trump has decided to <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2019%2F04%2F08%2Fworld%2Fmiddleeast%2Ftrump-iran-revolutionary-guard-corps.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cbef260a16b824914d56008d6bc695d4c%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636903558061482892&amp;sdata=2Uy7GcfAUNQ5svc7cxGtq8uMS6TjpWDtPE7SGpjDYBo%3D&amp;reserved=0">designate the Iranian regime’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization </a>
 (FTO) to counter Iran’s global campaign of terrorism. “This 
unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognizes the 
reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the
 IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a 
tool of statecraft,” President Donald Trump said in a statement Monday 
morning. “This designation will be the first time that the United States
 has ever named a part of another government as a FTO.” The designation 
takes effect on April 15th.</p>
<p>The Iranian regime lives and breathes Islamic extremism, which it 
seeks to export through its global jihad terrorist network. The IRGC 
sits at the center of that terrorist network. It provides funding, 
equipment, training, and logistical support to terrorist proxy groups, 
including most notably Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. The IRGC has 
American blood on its hands, going as far back as bombings in Beirut at 
the Marine barracks in 1983 and at the U.S. Embassy annex in 1984. The 
IRGC also caused casualties to U.S soldiers in Iraq by providing 
roadside bombs to its proxies. As Special Representative for Iran and 
Senior Adviser to the Secretary of State Brian Hook explained on Monday,
 “The IRGC has been threatening American troops almost since its 
inception. And whenever we impose sanctions on Iran, it’s usually 
followed by a range of threats. What endangers American troops in the 
Middle East is an IRGC that operates with impunity and never has its 
ambitions checked in the Middle East. We’re taking an entirely new 
approach to this of significant sort of sustained maximum economic 
pressure to deny the IRGC and the Iranian regime of the revenue that it 
needs to conduct its foreign policy.”</p>
<p>The IRGC has sustained itself financially over the years through its 
deep penetration into virtually all major facets of Iran’s economy, 
including its black markets. Countries, companies and individuals that 
do business with the IRGC and the many enterprises it controls are 
supporting what Mohsen Sazegara, a founding member of the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps and now a U.S.-based dissident described, <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cfr.org%2Fbackgrounder%2Firans-revolutionary-guards&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cbef260a16b824914d56008d6bc695d4c%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636903558061492908&amp;sdata=oF%2BQAbD%2BMOr7kmz%2FAV7hKdFlMck0JqDWApAdTG3Idv4%3D&amp;reserved=0">according to the Council on Foreign Relations</a>,
 as “something like the Communist Party, the KGB, a business complex, 
and the Mafia.” Add to that sinister profile a well-funded global 
terrorist enterprise.</p>
<p>President Trump’s decision to designate the IRGC as a whole as an FTO
 builds on previous steps taken against the IRGC. In 2007, the IRGC’s 
“elite” paramilitary Quds Force was subjected to terrorism-related 
Treasury sanctions for providing material support to the Taliban, 
Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. The Quds Force has been the
 leading arm of the IRGC used to export the Iranian regime’s brand of 
Islamic extremism and to support terrorist groups to that end.</p>
<p>However, while the Quds Force is the tip of the IRGC’s spear, it is 
far from being the entire spear. The IRGC has five branches (Ground 
Forces, Air Force, Navy, Basij militia, and Quds Force special 
operations) in addition to a counterintelligence directorate and 
representatives of the regime’s Supreme Leader. The IRGC oversees the 
Iranian regime’s ballistic missile program. In October 2017, the U.S. 
Treasury labeled the IRGC itself as a Specially Designated Global 
Terrorist for its activities “in support of the IRGC-Qods Force 
(IRGC-QF) … for providing support to a number of terrorist groups, 
including Hizballah and Hamas, as well as to the Taliban.”</p>
<p>President Trump has now upped the ante further by designating the 
IRGC altogether as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in its own right, 
based on the finding that the IRGC meets the legal criteria of engaging 
“in terrorist activity or terrorism” which “threatens the security of 
United States nationals or the national security of the United States.” 
The IRGC has moved from being treated as a supporting actor in providing
 backing for terrorism that its proxies undertake to an organization 
branded as directly engaging in terrorism itself. As Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo put it in his remarks to the press on Monday, “The IRGC will
 take its rightful place on the same list as terror groups its supports:
 Lebanese Hizballah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas, Kata’ib 
Hizballah, among others, all of which are already designated as foreign 
terrorist organizations.”</p>
<p>The IRGC’s designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization triggers 
the provisions of a law making it a federal criminal offense punishable 
by up to 20 years in prison for any person in the United States or 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to knowingly provide 
material support or resources to a designated Foreign Terrorist 
Organization. Material support or resources include any property or 
service, money, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or 
assistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, 
communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, 
explosives, personnel or transportation.</p>
<p>The prohibition against providing material support or resources to 
the IRGC as a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization would appear to 
preclude any individual or company subject to U.S. jurisdiction from 
doing business with any individuals or entities affiliated with any part
 of the IRGC and/or the vast pieces of the Iranian economy it controls. 
Secretary of State Pompeo offered some direct advice that Iran’s friends
 in Europe should heed: “If you’re the general counsel for a European 
financial institution today, there is more risk. I think this will 
require more diligence be done by every business that is considering 
doing things that are even now second and third orders removed from what
 you might think of as a traditional connection to the Iranian economy.”</p>
<p>Some military and intelligence officials were reluctant to recommend 
taking this additional step. They feared it could come back to bite our 
own servicemen and our allies fighting ISIS who, under some limited 
circumstances, may find themselves on the same side as the IRGC against 
the common ISIS enemy, as they have in the past. The question is whether
 providing some sort of support to IRGC forces in such circumstances 
could trigger potential criminal penalties for technically providing 
material support or resources to the IRGC. Concerns have also been 
raised how U.S. and its allies’ diplomats might be affected if they are 
perceived as giving some sort of advice or assistance to IRGC personnel,
 even in the context of negotiating for the release of hostages held by 
the IRGC. The State Department’s answer is that the law will be applied 
carefully on a case by case basis. Moreover, argue the opponents of the 
FTO designation, the designation will cause the Iranian regime to 
retaliate against U.S. personnel and assets in the region. Iran’s 
Supreme National Security Council has already responded with a threat, 
designating the United States Central Command, whose area of 
responsibility includes operations in the Middle East, as a terrorist 
organization.</p>
<p>Such objections miss the big picture. The Iranian regime is always 
making threats and shouting “death to America.” The Obama administration
 cowered in the face of such threats. The result was the disastrous 
nuclear deal that rewarded the Iranian regime economically while failing
 to stop its ballistic missile tests and failing to obtain ironclad 
inspections of all regime facilities, including its military and IRGC 
facilities, capable of developing nuclear materials, triggering devices 
and nuclear weapon miniaturization technology. The Trump administration 
reversed course, exited the nuclear deal, and re-imposed tough economic 
sanctions. As a result, the Iranian economy is in free-fall. The U.S. 
sanctions have cut off Iran’s access to billions of dollars in oil 
revenue and are driving its exports lower than ever before, according to
 the State Department. Three of the remaining eight importers granted 
waivers by the United States to buy oil from Iran have now cut their 
shipments to zero. Iran’s total trade has declined by nearly 25 percent 
within the last year. Its rial currency has lost two-thirds of its 
value.</p>
<p>President Trump’s latest move adds even more economic pressure on the
 Iranian regime and its principal arm for the spread of terror in the 
name of jihad. It has further isolated this arm, the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps, placing it in the same rogues’ gallery of 
designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations as ISIS and al Qaeda. The 
designation strips away any pretense that the IRGC serves any legitimate
 governmental function whatsoever or that it will not hesitate to use 
its control of vast sectors of the Iranian economy to feed the terrorist
 monster it has created and nurtured.</p>
<p>President Trump is forcing other countries to make a choice. Either 
join the United States in combating the increasing danger that the 
Iranian regime poses to peace and security through maximum economic 
pressure or the United States will be willing to go it alone as the 
leader of the free world. Anyone who gets in the way will do so at their
 own peril.</p>
