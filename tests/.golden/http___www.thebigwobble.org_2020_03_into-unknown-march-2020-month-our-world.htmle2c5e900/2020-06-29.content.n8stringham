<p> <span>Untold billions of animals and marine life have died due to man, disease and pollution in February </span>2020:
 Avian Flu, African Swine Fever, algae bloom and greed all a 
contribution to the carnage. Below is a "small" list, showing deaths of 
animals killed by disease, pollution or man in the 2nd month of 2020 and
 let me tell you, I have hardly scratched the surface, many millions of 
more deaths don't get reported. As for marine life, most of the dead 
sink to the bottom, or the birds, die out at sea, so you see, below is 
just a tiny per cent of the real carnage.</p>
<p> <span>Have you seen any of these disasters on the media? (Apart from
 the billion deaths of animals reported in the Aussie bushfires). No, it
 never gets mentioned. </span></p>

<p> Has the Coronavirus put Al Gore, Greta Thunberg et al into an embarrassing corner: <span>As the world scrubs itself of Carbon Dioxide emissions</span>
 will our planet cool down? We have a very interesting scenario 
developing around the world ladies and gentlemen. Al Gore, Greta 
Thunberg et al, are going to be left with egg on their faces as the use 
of carbon dioxide emissions drop drastically (which they blame for 
global warming) due to the global Convid-109 lockdown, as factories and 
fuel emissions decline world-wide. March brought a substantial (more 
than 45 %) drop in global commercial air traffic. According to their 
mantra, as co2 use drops so will the temperature of our planet. <a href="https://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/03/has-coronavirus-put-al-gore-greta.html">TBW</a></p>

Amsterdam region as the world enters lockdown: Libertine, tolerant and 
free Amsterdam is at this moment just like the rest of the world, empty

across only occasional other dog walkers or runners who are only too 
ready to distance themselves from me, eying me with caution. Empty 
busses pass me by as do the occasional automobile, however, Holland 
wouldn't be Holland without bicycles and scooters and, this is the mode

 I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard
 one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, “Come!” 2
 I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, 
and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on 
conquest.</p><p class="rm-manual">Comment on above: Napolean?</p><p class="rm-manual">3
 When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living 
creature say, “Come!” 4 Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. 
Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make 
people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.</p><p class="rm-manual">Comment on above: Communists? </p><p class="rm-manual">5
 When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature 
say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider 
was holding a pair of scales in his hand. 6 Then I heard what sounded 
like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, “Two pounds[a] of 
wheat for a day’s wages,[b] and six pounds[c] of barley for a day’s 
wages,[d] and do not damage the oil and the wine!” </p><p class="rm-manual">Comment on above: Everyone, including the communists, give in to unbridled pure capitalism.</p><p class="rm-manual">7
 When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth 
living creature say, “Come!” 8 I looked, and there before me was a pale 
horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind 
him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, 
famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.</p><p class="rm-manual">Comment
 on above: This is what is happening now, and easily seen on 
thebigwobble.org, and the wild beasts aren’t attacking, unless you count
 the source of SARS-2 (Covid-19) </p><p class="rm-manual">9 When he 
opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had 
been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had 
maintained. 10 They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign 
Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and 
avenge our blood?” 11 Then each of them was given a white robe, and they
 were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their 
fellow servants, their brothers and sisters,[e] were killed just as they
 had been.</p><p class="rm-manual">12 I watched as he opened the sixth 
seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth 
made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, 13 and the stars in 
the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a 
strong wind. 14 The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and 
every mountain and island was removed from its place. </p><p class="rm-manual">Comment on above: This is next, folks. Hold on to your butts!</p><p class="rm-manual">15
 Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the 
mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among 
the rocks of the mountains. 16 They called to the mountains and the 
rocks, “Fall on us and hide us[f] from the face of him who sits on the 
throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! 17 For the great day of their[g] 
wrath has come, and who can withstand it?”</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> </dd> <dd> <span> <a href="http://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/03/into-unknown-march-2020-month-our-world.html?showComment=1585661461980#c4846210815979271158"> 31 March 2020 at 15:31 </a> </span> </dd> <dt class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/02037948324377909119" rel="nofollow">Gary Walton</a> said... </dt> <dd> <p class="rm-manual"> Interesting, thanks, Larry </p> </dd> <dd> <span> <a href="http://www.thebigwobble.org/2020/03/into-unknown-march-2020-month-our-world.html?showComment=1585661764123#c7271078835792656080"> 31 March 2020 at 15:36 </a> </span> </dd> <dt class="rm-manual"> Christopher said... </dt> <dd> <p class="rm-manual">
