<h2 class="rm-manual">Quds Force chief Qassem Suleimani is still dead, I’m pretty sure</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">December 27, 2015 by Thomas Wictor</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that virtually every significant Iranian and Hezbollah commander in Syria has been killed. <a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/fruit-of-the-new-alliance/">The list is incredible.</a>
 Though some people say that this is because Iranian leaders go to the 
front lines to rally their men, I don’t believe it. I think Saudi and 
allied commandos are doing the killing. The National Council of 
Resistance of Iran (MEK) reported that Quds Force leader <a href="http://freebeacon.com/national-security/whatever-happened-to-qassem-soleimani/">Qassem Suleimani was severely wounded in the head</a> when his car was hit by a missile. I think he’s dead.</p>
<p>The Quds Force was originally the unit of the Iranian Revolutionary 
Guard Corps (IRGC) that was responsible for extraterritorial activities.
 However, so many Quds Force operatives have been killed in Syria that 
the IRGC began fighting outside the borders of Iran, which it hadn’t 
done before. It’s not clear how many IRGC troops were sent to Syria, but
 <a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/paper-tiger-revealed-in-syria-say-israelis-guess-who/">Israel says that they’ve been withdrawn due to heavy losses.</a> I think that’s true. The IRGC isn’t trained for unconventional warfare.</p>
<p>On December 24, 2015, Iran released what it claims are photos of 
Qassem Suleimani hale and hearty in the village of Bashkwi (or Bashkoy),
 Syria, north of Aleppo.</p>
<p>Here are some of the images. He’s with members of Hezbollah, we’re told.</p>
<p>I believe that these photos were taken in Iraq last year. Suleimani 
is wearing a copy of the American M81 Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) with 
Velcro patches for a name tag, branch of service tag, and shoulder 
patches on the jacket. The Syrian Arab Army (SAA) doesn’t issue 
woodland-pattern BDUs with Velcro patches.</p>
<p>Although the Jihad Council of Lebanese Hezbollah uses copies of the 
American BDU in woodland pattern, the jacket also lacks Velcro patches.</p>
<p>These are all Lebanese Hezbollah who were either on their way to Syria or were killed in Syria.</p>
<p>Iran created the paramilitary Hezbollah Brigades in Iraq, which the 
Quds Force modeled on the Lebanese Hezbollah. Iraqis wear 
woodland-pattern BDUs with name tags, branch tags, and shoulder patches 
on the jacket.</p>
<p>Note the giant beard on the Iraqi Hezbollah Brigades leader above. It
 matches those worn by the two men allegedly photographed with Suleimani
 on December 24, 2015.</p>
<p>You rarely see beards like that on Lebanese Hezbollah, and almost 
never on Quds Force or IRGC. Iraqi militia also roll their sleeve cuffs 
the way Suleimani did in the photos. Lebanese Hezbollah don’t roll their
 cuffs.</p>
<p>So, the woodland-pattern BDU jacket with Velcro patches is Iraqi, not Lebanese. Here are men of the Mujahideen of Iraq Brigade.</p>
<p>Another Iraqi Shi’ite militia, the al-Abbas Brigade.</p>
<p>All were trained by the Quds Force, which is why Qassem Suleimani spent so much time in Iraq.</p>
<p>Lebanese Hezbollah recently copied the American Army Combat Uniform 
(ACU), which has Velcro patches and a Mandarin collar. The two 
effeminate, now-dead Asian Hezbollah recruits below wear the 
woodland-pattern BDU (left) and the new ACU with a digital pattern 
(right).</p>
<h2>Quds Force couldn’t</h2>
<p>The Iranians say that <a href="http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/islamist-rebels-suffer-heavy-casualties-in-a-failed-bid-to-capture-bashkoy-in-northern-aleppo/">the battle of Bashkwi was a game-changing victory over the terrorists.</a></p>
<p>On Christmas day in the Aleppo Governorate’s northern countryside, 
the Islamist rebels from Jabhat Al-Nusra (Syrian Al-Qaeda group) and 
Jaysh Al-Mujahiddeen launched a massive assault on the National Defense 
Forces (NDF) frontline positions at the village of Bashkoy in order to 
build a large buffer-zone around their main supply route from Turkey to 
the provincial capital.</p>
<p>Initially, Jabhat Al-Nusra and Jaysh Al-Mujahiddeen were successful, 
capturing several points outside of the village and inside its eastern 
flank; however, their success did not last long as the Syrian Armed 
Forces eventually forestalled the Islamist advance and pushed back the 
encroaching enemy combatants attempting to infiltrate into Bashkoy’s 
residential area.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.islamicinvitationturkey.com/2015/12/27/notorious-saudi-emir-of-al-nusra-killed-in-bashkoy-aleppo/">a lot of claims being made.</a></p>
<p>An infamous Saudi terrorist ringleader stationed in the strategic 
town of Bashkoy Northwest of Aleppo province was killed in a special 
operation of the Syrian army.</p>
<p>“The Syrian army units killed Abu Muthna al-Madanai, the al-Nusra Front’s emir of the region,” military sources said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The hunting operation was carried out after the terrorists failed to 
capture the strategic town of Bashkoy in another massive attack on army 
positions on Saturday. Hundreds of terrorists staged at least three 
major attacks on army positions near Bashkoy on Friday and Saturday to 
win control over the town.</p>
<p>After repelling the first attack on Saturday, sources told FNA that 
the Syrian army forces killed scores of Takfiri terrorists, destroyed 7 
tanks, a BMP vehicle and 23mm cannon and seized a tank.</p>
<p>Reports also said the Syrian army killed Mohammed A’war, the military
 commander of the Fajr al-Khelafa Battalions, in clashes with the 
terrorists in the vicinity of Bashkoy.</p>
<p>I can’t find any information on Abu Muthna al-Madanai. However, two months ago, <a href="http://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2015/19-october-alnusra-commanderemir-of-southern-aleppo-region">the Syrians said they’d killed the al-Nusra emir of the region, a guy named Khaled Ataua.</a> There’s no information on him either.</p>
<p>According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the Battle of Bashkwi <a href="http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=41369">killed 38 al-Nusra Front and Mujahedeen Army rebels, and at least 33 regime fighters.</a> Not a strategic win by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>The Iranians published some very gruesome video of dead men they 
claimed were al-Nusra Front terrorists. Some of them are seen in a photo
 of one of the beardos posing with Qassem Suleimani.</p>
<p>There’s no need to post the video or the uncensored photos, because 
it’s all fake. None of the bodies have any military equipment or shoes, 
and all were shot in the head and then dragged so that their shirts 
ended up around their necks, or they lost their pants. They may have 
been terrorists, but they were obviously killed after being captured.</p>
<p>Everybody’s playing games. Suleimani is said to have visited Iranian and Lebanese fighters <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/10/qods-force-commander-qassem-soleimani-rallies-iranian-officers-hezbollah-in-syria.php">in Syria on October 14, 2015.</a> Although Reuters allegedly verified Suleimani’s presence, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKCN0S81A320151015">the linked article makes no mention of him.</a>
 This has something to do with the fact that the 
Iranian-Russian-Lebanese-Afghan-Iraqi offensives that began on October 
7, 2015, were stopped in their tracks by Arab special forces.</p>
<p>Reuters reported on October 13 that<a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/rough-men-who-do-violence-on-our-behalf/"> the big offensives were hit by massive numbers of American BGM-71 antitank guided missiles (ATGMs).</a>
 Then Reuters stealth-edited the piece to make it sound as if the rebels
 were the ones in trouble. Videos show that people with amazing skill <a href="http://www.thomaswictor.com/arab-league-and-israeli-plan-for-the-middle-east-goes-forward/">are firing a special long-range version of the BGM-71 TOW that has a thermobaric warhead.</a> Officially, this weapon does not exist.</p>
<p>On December 26, 2015, the leader of Jaish al-Islam—Zahran Alloush—<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/syria-rebel-chief-zahran-alloush-killed-monitor-opposition-163954620.html#">was killed in an air strike.</a> Syria claimed responsibility.</p>
<p>Bull.</p>
<p>The Syrians are hopelessly incompetent. Jaish al-Islam said that this
 was a secret meeting of commanders, and they were all killed. My guess 
is that Alloush was told how post-Assad Syria is going to be, and he 
said, “No way! It’s gonna be sharia to the power of fifty, man!” He was 
known as an authoritarian hardliner. So the same people killing everyone
 who needs to be killed put him on the list too.</p>
<p>There comes a point when you’re done screwing around. The world has 
indulged the fantasies of violent jihadists for going on forty years 
now. It’s over. The jihadists are facing people who have much more to 
lose than do the mullahs or Hassan Nasrallah or Bashar al-Assad or the 
average young man dreaming of 72 houris. And now those with so much to 
lose have the means with which to stop the destruction.</p>
<p>Nobody fights more ruthlessly than a protector.</p>
<p>In conclusion, compare Qassem Suleimani on October 18, 2015 (left), to Qassem Suleimani on December 24, 2015 (right).</p>
<p>Do you really believe that two months of unrelenting combat will make a person look younger, healthier, and happier?</p>
