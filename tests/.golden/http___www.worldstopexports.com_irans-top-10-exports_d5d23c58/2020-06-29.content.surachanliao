<figcaption>Natanz City decoration</figcaption><p>Sharing its eastern 
borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran 
shipped an estimated US$27 billion worth of goods around the globe in 
2019. That dollar amount reflects a -55.1% decrease since 2015 and a 
-72.1% drop from 2018 to 2019.</p>
<p>The latest available country-specific data from 2018 shows that 60.5%
 of products exported from Iran were bought by importers in: China 
(14.7% of the global total), Iraq (14.3%), United Arab Emirates (9.5%), 
Afghanistan (4.7%), South Korea (4.1%), Turkey (3.8%), India (3.3%), 
Pakistan (2.0%), Indonesia (1.3%), Oman (1.2%), Thailand (1.1%) and 
Azerbaijan (0.7%).</p>
<p>Given Iran’s population of 83.3 million people, its total $27 billion
 in 2019 exports translates to roughly $350 for every resident in the 
Middle Eastern country.</p>
<h1>Iran’s Top 10 Exports</h1>
<h2>Top 10</h2>
<p>The following export product groups represent the highest dollar 
value in Iranian global shipments during 2019. Also shown is the 
percentage share each export category represents in terms of overall 
exports from Iran.</p>
<ol> <li>Mineral fuels including oil: US$16.4 billion (60.8% of total exports)</li> <li>Plastics, plastic articles: $3.1 billion (11.6%)</li> <li>Organic chemicals: $1.6 billion (6.1%)</li> <li>Ores, slag, ash: $1.3 billion (5%)</li> <li>Fruits, nuts: $835.8 million (3.1%)</li> <li>Iron, steel: $725.7 million (2.7%)</li> <li>Copper: $540.6 million (2%)</li> <li>Salt, sulphur, stone, cement: $412.1 million (1.5%)</li> <li>Fertilizers: $204.7 million (0.8%)</li> <li>Vegetables: $173 million (0.6%)</li> </ol>
<p>Iran’s top 10 exports accounted for 94.2% of the overall value of its global shipments.</p>
<p>Ores, slag and ash (up 18.1%) was Iran’s sole top export category to 
grow from 2018 to 2019, powered by higher international sales of iron 
ores and concentrates.</p>
<p>The leading decliner among Iran’s top 10 export categories was vegetables thanks to a -83.9% drop year over year.</p>
<p>At the more granular four-digit Harmonized Tariff System code level, 
crude oil represents Iran’s most valuable exported product at 51.1% of 
the country’s total. In second place were ethylene polymers (10.4%), 
iron ores and concentrates (4.7%), acyclic alcohols (4.6%), 
miscellaneous nuts (2%), refined copper and unwrought alloys (1.5%) and 
semi-finished iron or non-alloy steel products (1.2%).</p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>The following types of Iranian product shipments represent positive 
net exports or a trade balance surplus. Investopedia defines net exports
 as the value of a country’s total exports minus the value of its total 
imports.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, net exports represent the amount by which foreign 
spending on a home country’s goods or services exceeds or lags the home 
country’s spending on foreign goods or services.</p>
<ol> <li>Mineral fuels including oil: US$16.2 billion (Down by -75.5% since 2018)</li> <li>Plastics, plastic articles: $2.2 billion (Down by -47.8%)</li> <li>Ores, slag, ash: $1.3 billion (Up by 19.7%)</li> <li>Fruits, nuts: $737.4 million (Down by -44.3%)</li> <li>Copper: $522.7 million (Down by -23%)</li> <li>Organic chemicals: $381.6 million (Down by -86%)</li> <li>Iron, steel: $378.5 million (Down by -86%)</li> <li>Salt, sulphur, stone, cement: $349.3 million (Down by -49.8%)</li> <li>Zinc: $158.7 million (Down by -34.1%)</li> <li>Vegetables: $119.4 million (Down by -85.7%)</li> </ol>
<p>Iran has highly positive net exports in the international trade of 
mineral fuels-related products particularly crude oil and, to a lesser 
extent, refined oils, petroleum gases and petroleum residues including 
coke and bitumen. In turn, these cashflows indicate Iran’s strong 
competitive advantages under the mineral fuel products-related category.</p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<p>Iran incurred an estimated -$160.4 million deficit for 2019, reversing a $55.4 billion surplus one year earlier.</p>
<p>Below are exports from Iran that result in negative net exports or 
product trade balance deficits. These negative net exports reveal 
product categories where foreign spending on home country Iran’s goods 
trail Iranian importer spending on foreign products.</p>
<ol> <li>Cereals: -US$3.6 billion (Down by -17.2% since 2018)</li> <li>Machinery including computers: -$3.5 billion (Down by -51.7%)</li> <li>Electrical machinery, equipment: -$2.1 billion (Down by -39%)</li> <li>Optical, technical, medical apparatus: -$1.3 billion (Down by -3.5%)</li> <li>Pharmaceuticals: -$1.1 billion (Down by -27.2%)</li> <li>Oil seeds: -$1 billion (Down by -30.2%)</li> <li>Food industry waste, animal fodder: -$918.1 million (Up by 43.1%)</li> <li>Animal/vegetable fats, oils, waxes: -$815.4 million (Down by -15.7%)</li> <li>Paper, paper items: -$670.3 million (Down by -8.5%)</li> <li>Vehicles: -$670.2 million (Down by -50.4%)</li> </ol>
<p>Iran has highly negative net exports and therefore deep international
 trade deficits for rice, corn and barley under the cereals category.</p>
<h2>Companies</h2>
<h1>Iranian Export Companies</h1>
<p>According to global trade intelligence firm Zepol, the following companies are examples of diverse exporters from Iran.</p>
<ul> <li>Pars Pak (carpets, other textile floor coverings)</li> <li>Sana T Tejarat Anahita (grapes, raisins)</li> <li>Khadem Trading (cereals, aerated/mineral water)</li> <li>Dezdasht Agro Industry (juice, jams)</li> <li>Omid Nikan (acyclic polyhydric alcohols)</li> <li>Kayson (grinding machines, tubes/pipes/hoses, doors)</li> <li>Dashte Morghab (flour, meal)</li> <li>Celulose Irani (wooden furniture)</li> <li>Bushehr Marine Products (citrus fruit, melons)</li> <li>Axis Global Trading (pistachios)</li> </ul>
<p>In macroeconomic terms, Iran’s total exported goods represent 1.8% of
 its overall Gross Domestic Product for 2019 ($1.471 trillion valued in 
Purchasing Power Parity US dollars). That 1.8% for exports to overall 
GDP in PPP for 2019 compares to 4.1% for 2018. Those metrics suggest a 
relatively decreasing reliance on products sold on international markets
 for Iran’s total economic performance albeit based on a short 
timeframe.</p>
<p>Another key indicator of a country’s economic performance is its 
unemployment rate. Iran’s average unemployment rate was 14.481% for 2019
 down from 16.784% one year earlier, according to the International 
Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Iran’s capital city is Tehran.</p>
