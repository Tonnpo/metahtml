<p class="rm-manual">Before the using of military force, the US is 
trying to engage China to the solution of the North Korean problem. If 
the United States persuades China to solve this issue with the benefit 
for both countries, Kim Jong-un's regime can face catastrophic 
consequences</p>

<p>Military and political tension around the Korean peninsula does not 
cease. Since the beginning of the year, under the order of supreme 
leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea has conducted six nuclear missile tests.
 The last unsuccessful test of a ballistic missile was conducted by the 
North Korean authorities on April 5. The current sanctions of the US, EU
 and Japan against individuals and legal entities of the DPRK did not 
persuade the North Korean regime to abandon the development of new 
missiles. In the United States, various pressure options are being 
worked out for North Korea, in addition to sanctions. The National 
Security Council of the United States considered options for placing 
nuclear weapons in South Korea and even physical elimination of Kim 
Jong-un.</p>
<p>We recall that, in conjunction with US military experts, South Korea 
is preparing by 2019 a special military unit of up to 2 thousand people 
to eliminate the North Korean leadership in the case of Pyongyang's 
military aggression and the use of nuclear weapons. However, before 
starting to use force, the White House is trying to invite China to 
solve the North Korean problem.</p>
<p> Advice of "elder brother"</p>
<p>Despite a difficult period in US-China relations, US President Donald
 Trump recently invited his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to visit his 
estate in Florida. During the dinner they discussed the problem of North
 Korea. The US knows firsthand about the fact that China has an 
influence on the dynasty of North Korean dictators. Without China's 
military intervention in the Korean War (1950-53), American troops 
wouldn’t have succeeded in completely destroying a group of North Korean
 troops. If at one time China gave impetus to the development of the 
communist regime in North Korea, then the Chinese Communists have more 
chances to convince their North Korean counterparts to abandon the 
nuclear missile program. China is not interested in escalating the 
conflict on the Korean peninsula near its borders. In this case, a large
 number of North Korean refugees will appear in China.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping offered Donald Trump his version of solving the problem. 
China will try to persuade Kim Jong-un to stop the development and 
testing of nuclear weapons. In return, the United States and South Korea
 will stop conducting joint military exercises aimed at deterring and 
intimidating Pyongyang. China has all the conditions for imposing 
sanctions on North Korea, if Kim Jong-un will not listen to the advice 
of his "elder brother". China is the main foreign economic partner of 
the DPRK. Turnover between China and North Korea in 2014 amounted to 6.8
 billion dollars - 70% of the total trade turnover of Pyongyang. North 
Koreans depend on the supply of food and energy from China. The problem 
of food in the DPRK is really acute. In the 90s from 800 thousand to 2.4
 million North Koreans died because of famine. After DPRK conducted a 
nuclear test in 2006, China supported the UN Security Council resolution
 1718, which provided imposing sanctions against North Korea. After 
another nuclear test in the DPRK in 2013, China has limited the supply 
of energy to the North Koreans.</p>

<p>North Korea has experience in reaching compromises with the United 
States. The previous leader of the DPRK Kim Jong Il (Kim Jong-un's 
father) signed with the US President Bill Clinton the Framework 
Agreement in 1994. According to the document, in exchange for freezing 
the nuclear program, the United States pledged to supply North Korea 
with fuel oil and build two nuclear reactors (which have not been 
built). The United States also provided North Korea with food and 
medicine.</p>
<p>China, no less than the US, is concerned about North Korea's nuclear 
missile tests. It is not so much scared of potential threat of nuclear 
weapons use by the DPRK but of the sale of ballistic missiles with 
nuclear warheads to radical Islamists. In the opinion of Wallace 
Gregson, Lieutenant-General of the Marine Corps of the United States, 
North Korea is making profits in the black market bypassing 
international sanctions through the sale of counterfeit products and the
 drug trade. The DPRK can take a firm position in the black arms market,
 and its clients are China's opponents - the radical Islamists. In the 
Chinese Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (East Turkestan) there are 
separatist tendencies. The Uighur armed formation "Islamic Movement of 
East Turkestan" is interested in seceding from China and creating an 
independent theocratic state. Uygur Islamists are suspected of having 
links with Al-Qaida terrorist organizations and the Taliban.</p>
<p>One good turn deserves another The very fact that the United States 
has sought assistance from China to resolve the North Korean problem is a
 signal that the Donald Trump Administration is considering the 
possibility of sharing responsibility for the maintenance of 
international security with Chinese counterparts. In view of the 
existing economic interdependence, for the United States and China it is
 more profitable to cooperate and divide spheres of influence in the 
world than to oppose each other. China is the main creditor of the 
United States. According to the US Congress, bilateral trade turnover 
between the two countries has grown from $ 2 billion to $ 579 billion 
over the past 37 years.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Chinese leadership expects from its American 
counterparts certain concessions on existing disputable issues in the 
Asia-Pacific region (APR) if assistance in resolving the North Korean 
problem proves successful. The US and China are long-standing rivals in 
the APR. China claims to the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, 
which are disputed by the ASEAN countries, including the regional 
partners of the United States in the face of Malaysia, Taiwan and the 
Philippines. Also, China wants to take the Senkaku Islands, which are 
part of Japan, the US support point in the Far East since the end of the
 Second World War.</p>
<p>Beijing is interested in Washington not hindering the strengthening 
of its navy and the militarization of the South China Sea. The Pacific 
Fleet is the most powerful naval group in the Asia-Pacific region and 
former President Barack Obama has repeatedly sent US ships to patrol the
 South China Sea in order to restrain China's activity – this country 
continues to build military facilities on natural and artificial 
islands.</p>
<p>Another point is the further development of North Korea. China is 
interested in the US secretly recognizing the DPRK as the sphere of 
influence of Beijing and not contributing to the change of the communist
 regime, not aiming to unite the "two Koreas" into a single state under 
the jurisdiction of Seoul. The maximum that Beijing can be interested in
 is the change in the regime of Kim Jong-un to a more predictable power 
that will preserve the communist system and orient itself in social and 
economic development to neighboring China, where the market economy is 
thriving.</p>

<p>It is difficult to guess whether the US will backtrack in favor of 
China in the APR, which is perceived as an area of interest of the White
 House, for the sake of resolving the North Korean problem. It is 
doubtful that cooperation in stabilizing the situation in the DPRK will 
entail resolving all the controversial issues of the United States and 
China.</p>
<p>Plan B</p>
<p>Maybe the Chinese leadership's attempt to persuade North Korean 
colleagues to stop the development and testing of nuclear weapons will 
not result with success. According to the CNN news agency, after coming 
to power in the DPRK, Kim Jong-un systematically conducts repressions 
against political opponents who maintain ties with China. He is a 
typical dictator of a totalitarian state, which seeks to hold all the 
power in its hands and prevents outside influence on the political 
processes in North Korea.</p>
<p>In this case, the Pentagon is working on options for using military 
force against the DPRK, if other means of persuasion or coercion prove 
their ineffectiveness. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that if 
North Korea threatens South Korea and the US military (there are 28 
thousand US troops in South Korea), then the US will have to give an 
adequate response. The White House is already demonstrating the power to
 Kim Jong-un, sending a group of US naval forces of two destroyers, a 
cruiser and an aircraft carrier "Karl Vinson" from Singapore to the 
Korean coast. The Pentagon makes it clear to Kim Jong-un that if 
necessary, the US military are ready to fire several dozen cruise 
missiles and conduct air strikes on North Korea's military facilities, 
just like it was in Syria.</p>
<p>An alternative option for restraining North Korea's military activity
 could be the use of American warships equipped with the Aegis missile 
defense system (a similar missile defense system is located in Romania).
 These ships can carry on duty in Korean waters and shoot down missiles 
launched from the territory of the DPRK during the tests or exercises.</p>
<p>The death of Kim Jong-un is unlikely to solve the problem of the 
North Korean nuclear missile program. The totalitarian communist regime 
in North Korea is a system where Kim is a cog, who inherited the powers 
of the head of state from his father. His place, if necessary, will be 
occupied by some general or political figure. As after the death of 
Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union did not cease to exist, so after the 
death of Kim Jong-un, the DPRK's behavior may remain unpredictable and 
dangerous. In its political culture, North Korea has borrowed a lot from
 Stalinism - the cult of personality, repression and the constant search
 for external enemies.</p>
