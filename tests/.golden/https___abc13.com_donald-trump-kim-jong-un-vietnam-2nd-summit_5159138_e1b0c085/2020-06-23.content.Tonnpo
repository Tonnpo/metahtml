<h1 class="rm-manual">President Trump and Kim Jong Un meet for the opening of second nuclear summit</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>AP</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual">By JONATHAN LEMIRE, FOSTER KLUG and DEB RIECHMANN</p>
<p>HANOI, Vietnam -- U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim 
Jong Un, leaders of nations with a long history of hostilities, opened 
their second summit Wednesday with smiles and friendly banter before 
sitting down for a dinner that will set the stage for difficult talks 
about North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>"I think it'll lead to really a wonderful situation long term," Trump said as he sat beside Kim at the dinner table.</p>
<p>Asked if the summit would yield a political declaration to end the Korean War, Trump said, "We'll see."</p>
<p>Kim, speaking through an interpreter, told Trump he was "confident of achieving the great results that everyone will welcome."</p>
<p>The venue, the colonial and neoclassical Sofitel Legend Metropole in the old part of Hanoi, came with a bit of irony.</p>
<p>Trump will be trying to convince Kim to give up his pursuit of 
nuclear weapons at a hotel that has bomb shelter that protected the 
likes of actress Jane Fonda and singer Joan Baez from American air raids
 during the Vietnam War. According to the hotel's website, the bunker 
was closed and sealed after the war ended in the mid-1970s. It was 
rediscovered by chance during a bar renovation project in 2011.</p>
<p>Trump was joined at dinner by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and 
acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Kim was accompanied by 
Kim Yong Chol, a former military spy chief and Kim's point man in 
negotiations, and Ri Yong Ho, the foreign affairs minister. Interpreters
 for each side also attended.</p>
<p>Anticipation for what will be accomplished at the summit ran high in 
Hanoi. But the carnival-like atmosphere in the Vietnamese capital, with 
street artists painting likenesses of the leaders and vendors hawking 
T-shirts showing Kim waving and Trump giving a thumbs-up, contrasted 
with the serious items on their agenda.</p>
<p>Scoring a victory at the summit would offset Trump's political troubles back in Washington, where <a href="https://abc13.com/politics/cohen-says-trump-knew-about-wikileaks-email-dump-beforehand/5159156/">Michael Cohen</a>,
 his former personal attorney, was prepared to tell lawmakers that Trump
 is a "racist," a "conman" and a "cheat." Earlier in the day, after 
meeting with the president of Vietnam, Trump was unable to ignore the 
drama playing out thousands of miles away. </p>
