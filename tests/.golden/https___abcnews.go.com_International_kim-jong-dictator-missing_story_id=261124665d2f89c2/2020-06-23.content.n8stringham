<p>— -- This isn't the first time that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/eyes-kim-north-korea-preps-anniversary-26064013">Kim Jong-un</a> has gone missing but the North Korean leader is breaking his own record by staying out of the public eye for this long. </p>
<p> Purposefully disappearing for long periods of time is a move long used by dictators, including former Venezuelan President <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-hugo-chavez.htm">Hugo Chavez</a> and Cuban President <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-fidel-castro.htm">Fidel Castro</a>, and though Kim Jong-un's absence for more than a month has sparked the international rumor mill. </p>
<p> The 31-year-old dictator learned the power of the vanishing act from the best of them: his father. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/kim-jong-il.htm">Kim Jong-il</a>
 "went missing" for up to 80 days when he reportedly had a stroke in 
2008. Potential health issues remains the most likely reason for Kim 
Jong-un's notable absence, and it is a reason he has not used before.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/sister-north-koreas-kim-jong-likes-power-eric/story?id=26081187">Meet Kim Jong-un's Mysterious Sister</a></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/10/where-is-kim-jong-un-and-six-more-questions-about-north-koreas-leader/">Where Is Kim Jong-un? And 6 More Questions About North Korea’s Leader</a></p>
<p> "No one knows why Kim Jong-un is out of sight, but he has been the 
most public of the three dynastic leaders," Katherine Moon, a senior 
fellow for the Center for East Asia Policy Studies, told ABC News, 
referring to the line of leadership that began with Kim Jong-un's 
grandfather, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/eternal-president-kim-il-sung.htm">Kim Il-sung</a>. She said that his increasing weight, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/lifestyle/health/alcoholism.htm">alcoholism</a>,
 heart or ankle problems and stress are all among the health factors 
that could be ailing him, though nothing has been confirmed. </p>
<p> "He may also be facing personal challenges -- he does have a family 
-- a wife and at least one child. Perhaps there is illness or some other
 problem. Again, who knows?" Moon said. </p>
<p> North Korea expert Michael Madden, who runs a leadership watch blog 
and contributes to Johns Hopkins University's Korean Studies site, told 
ABC News that there were two other times that he has gone missing since 
taking control of the country following his father's death in December 
2011.</p>

<p> The first came in June 2012, when he went missing for about three 
weeks. As with many things in North Korea, the lack of transparency 
means that nothing is known for sure, but Madden said that this absence 
lined up with when the supreme leader's wife would have been entering 
the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/lifestyle/health/second-trimester.htm">second trimester</a> of her pregnancy, leading him to believe that it was his wife's health that kept him out of the spotlight rather than his own. </p>
<p> "There's no reason to really think it was his health back then," Madden said. "He was more muscular than he is now." </p>
<p> The second absence came in April 2013, though he was only out of the
 public eye for about two weeks immediately after a rather turbulent 
political period, so it may have been a strategic move on the part of 
his advisers. </p>
<p> "Given that the DPRK regime is the most opaque on earth, it's not 
surprising that there is very little reliable and publicly available 
information about this," <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/national-security-council.htm">National Security Council</a>
 spokesman Patrick Ventrell told ABC News regarding Kim's latest 
disappearance, referring to North Korea by its official name, the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. </p>
<p> Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez remained out of sight for 
more than two months while he recovered from his fourth cancer-related 
surgery in December 2012, according to the Associated Press. </p>
<p> At the time, the state's foreign minister made regular public 
updates, at one point telling how Chavez was "in charge and making 
decisions." One noted difference between the Chavez absence at the time 
and Kim Jong-un's latest vanishing period is the relative openness that 
Venezuelan officials used to address the issue. Chavez was seen waving 
to supporters as he boarded the plane to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/cuba.htm">Cuba</a> for his surgery, and officials told the Associated Press that "it's a slow, slow recovery process." </p>
<p> When Kim Jong-il is believed to have had his stroke in 2008, North 
Korean press officials did their best to prevent any admission of ill 
health. Madden said that officials claimed Kim Jong-il attended two 
public events during his roughly 80-day absence, though there were no 
photos taken at one event and the images released from the second were 
believed to be doctored. </p>
<p> One factor that makes Kim Jong-un's ongoing absence different from 
the rest of the dictatorial pack is his age. Though his health is 
clearly a cause for concern -- since he has grown noticeably larger and 
was seen limping in his last public appearance -- his age makes the 
prospect of a grave medical issue less of a concern.</p>

<p> Each time Fidel Castro is not seen for long periods, which occurs 
regularly, a fresh crop of death rumors begins to circulate. One of the 
longest stretches came last year, when, at 87, he wasn't seen for eight 
months and, according to the Associated Press, that stretch was broken 
on Jan. 8 when he attended a gallery opening in Havana. </p>
<p> Kim Jong-un acknowledged his absence from Friday's celebration of 
the national party's anniversary by sending flowers that were placed in 
front of statues of his father and grandfather. </p>
<p> "I'm going to give Kim Jong-un until Monday to show up," Madden said. </p>
