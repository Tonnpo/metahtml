<p>MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Texas teenager known for using an "affluenza" 
defense in a fatal drunken-driving accident likely won't return to the 
U.S. anytime soon because of a Mexican judge's decision to delay his 
deportation Wednesday, but a Mexico immigration official said his mother
 was being flown to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Richard Hunter, chief deputy for the U.S. Marshals Service in South 
Texas, said during a news conference in Houston that a three-day court 
injunction granted to Ethan Couch will likely take at least two weeks to
 resolve.</p>
<p>Later in the day, however, the teen's mother, Tonya Couch, was put on
 a plane to be flown from Guadalajara to Los Angeles, an official with 
Mexico's National Immigration Institute told The Associated Press. The 
official said she would be turned over to U.S. marshals.</p>
<p>The official, who was not authorized to discuss the case and spoke on
 condition of anonymity, said the woman was sent to the United States 
because immigration authorities did not receive a judge's injunction 
like the one that temporarily blocked her son's deportation.</p>
<p>Ethan Couch was transported late Wednesday to Mexico City, the 
official said. The decision to move Couch was made because the Mexico 
City facility for detaining migrants is larger and better equipped to 
hold someone for days or weeks. The official would not say if he was 
being moved by air or ground.</p>
<p>Authorities believe the 18-year-old Couch, who was sentenced only to 
probation for the 2013 wreck in Texas, fled to Mexico with his mother in
 November as prosecutors investigated whether he had violated his 
probation. Both were taken into custody Monday after authorities said a 
phone call for pizza led to their capture in the resort city of Puerto 
Vallarta.</p>
<p>The ruling earlier Wednesday by the Mexican court gives a judge three
 days to decide whether the younger Couch has grounds to challenge his 
deportation based on arguments that kicking him out of the country would
 violate his rights.</p>
<p>Hunter said the legal maneuver basically takes the decision out of an
 immigration agent's hands and asks a higher authority to make the 
deportation decision. He said such cases can often take anywhere from 
two weeks to several months, depending on the priorities of the local 
courts.</p>
<p>"It also depends on the fact the Couches have legal counsel. And it 
seems to me, if they wanted to, they could pay them as much money as 
they want to drag this thing out," Hunter said. "We're hopeful that's 
not the case. We're hopeful the Mexican immigration court will make a 
quick and decisive decision and return the Couches to America."</p>
<p>During the sentencing phase of Couch's trial in 2013, a defense 
expert argued that his wealthy parents coddled him into a sense of 
irresponsibility — a condition the expert termed "affluenza." The 
condition is not recognized as a medical diagnosis by the American 
Psychiatric Association, and its invocation during the legal proceedings
 drew ridicule.</p>
<p>"Couch continues to make a mockery of the system," said Fort Worth 
attorney Bill Berenson, who represented Sergio Molina, who was paralyzed
 and suffered severe brain damage in the crash.</p>
<p>Couch's attorneys in the U.S. issued a statement Wednesday saying 
they couldn't comment on the case because they weren't licensed to 
practice law in Mexico. It wasn't immediately clear which attorneys were
 handling the case in Mexico.</p>
<p>Mexican police say Couch and his mother spent three days in a rented 
condo at a resort development in Puerto Vallarta before finding an 
apartment. One of the Couches' telephones had been used to order 
delivery from Domino's Pizza to the condominium complex in Puerto 
Vallarta's old town, far from the glitzy resorts of the city's newer 
section, according to a police report issued by the Jalisco state 
prosecutors' office.</p>
<p>Agents from the prosecutors' office went to the complex, where a 
tourism operator told them that the people who had occupied the condo 
were asked to vacate because the owners were coming to stay over 
Christmas, the report said. The Couches then moved to an apartment, and 
the agents set up a surveillance operation in the surrounding streets.</p>
<p>On Monday evening, two people matching the Couches' description were 
spotted and intercepted. The police report said they behaved evasively, 
claimed to be carrying no IDs, gave inconsistent stories about their 
names and failed to provide proof of their legal migratory status in 
Mexico.</p>
<p>They were taken into custody and handed over to immigration officials.</p>
<p>In Texas, Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson said Tuesday that the 
Couches had prepared to be gone a while, even dyeing the teenager's 
blond hair black.</p>
<p>"They had planned to disappear. They even had something that was 
almost akin to a going-away party before leaving town," Anderson said. 
He declined to detail the party, including how many people attended.</p>
<p>Anderson said Couch and his mother apparently crossed the border in 
her pickup and drove to Puerto Vallarta. No immediate charges were 
planned for others who may have known about or assisted with the plan, 
Anderson said. He noted that authorities have no evidence that Couch's 
father, who owns a sheet metal factory in North Texas, was involved.</p>
<p>The sheriff has said he believes the two fled in late November, after
 a video surfaced that appears to show Ethan Couch at a party where 
people were drinking. If found to be drinking, Couch could see his 
probation revoked and face up to four months in jail.</p>
<p>Authorities began searching for him and his mother after he missed a 
mandatory appointment with his probation officer on Dec. 10.</p>
<p>Tarrant County District Attorney Sharen Wilson said Tuesday that she 
planned to ask that Couch's case be transferred to adult court, where he
 could face up to 120 days in an adult jail, followed by 10 years' 
probation. If he violates that probation, he could face up to 10 years 
in prison per death, Wilson said.</p>
<p>Anderson said an arrest warrant was being issued for Tonya Couch on 
charges of hindering an apprehension, a third-degree felony that carries
 a sentence of two to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>Couch was driving drunk and speeding near Fort Worth in June 2013, 
when he crashed into a disabled SUV, killing four people and injuring 
several others, including passengers in his pickup truck.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty to four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two
 counts of intoxication assault causing serious bodily injury. A judge 
sentenced him in juvenile court to 10 years' probation and a stint in a 
rehabilitation center.</p>
