 Finds White Liberal Women Prone to Mental Health Issues - The Question 
Here Is Are They Drawn To Liberalism Because They Are Crazy, Or Did 
Liberalism Drive Them Crazy?</h2> <p class="rm-manual">By Susan Duclos - <a href="">All News PipeLine</a></p> <p>A
 study done by Pew Research back in March 2020, but received little to 
no attention until recently, provides even further evidence that those 
that self-identify as liberals, also report they have been diagnosed 
with a mental health issue at a much higher rate than those that are 
listed as "moderate," or "conservative."</p> <p></p><p>In an analysis of that Pew Research study, <a href="https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/over-50-percent-white-liberal-women-under-30-mental-health-condition">Evie Magazine found the numbers for "white liberal women," are even worse.</a></p><p></p> <blockquote>The
 study, which examined white liberals, moderates, and conservatives, 
both male and female, found that conservatives were far less likely to 
be diagnosed with mental health issues than those who identified as 
either liberal or even “very liberal.” What’s more, white women suffered
 the worst of all. White women, ages 18-29, who identified as liberal 
were given a mental health diagnosis from medical professionals at a 
rate of 56.3%, as compared to 28.4% in moderates and 27.3% in 
conservatives.</blockquote> <p>This also helps explain the constant 
video uploads by liberals, mostly women," melting down and thinking it 
is somehow normal behavior.</p> <p>This backs up previous studies, but the numbers are becoming worse, as the "politics" become more unhinged as well.</p> <p>A few examples of the most radicalized ideological and/or cultural issues that liberals are pushing.</p> <p>"Chestfeeding"
 versus breastfeeding, which is yet another push to erase women in the 
name of "inclusion," because they insist that to "identify" as a women, 
makes on a women no matter what genitalia they were born with.</p> <p>Insistence on a new "American flag" to represent "everyone," by <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/for-juneteenth-its-time-for-a-new-flag-11623958522">claiming Old Glory is the new "confederate" flag</a> and inherently racist.</p> <p>Claims
 that to be white is to automatically be a racist, which means whites 
identifying as liberal are calling themselves racist for nothing more 
than the color of skin they were born with.</p> <p>Isn't that a form of self-hatred? </p> <p>Abortion
 is referred to as "reproductive rights," when frankly abortion has 
nothing to do with reproduction because it is the exact opposite. 
Killing a child is in no way, shape or form, "reproduction."</p> <p>Liberals
 push to have transgenders allowed to compete in women's sports despite 
the physical disparity, no matter what the person in question 
"identifies" as. White liberal women are pushing the hardest for this, 
which again, go against everything true feminists fought for. </p> <p>(Note)
 There are some feminists against the men in women's sports and the 
"chestfeeding" terminology, but their voices are drowned out by the 
harpies screaming bigotry if anyone dares speak out against the erasing 
of women. </p> <p>There are so many ideological topics that are 
counter-productive to women, yet white liberals rush to jump on the 
bandwagon to support those issues.</p> <p>It is nothing short of supporting gender suicide.</p> <p>Related - <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/04/22/study-young-white-liberals-more-likely-to-have-mental-health-problems/">Study: Young White Liberals More Likely to Have Mental Health Problems</a></p> <p><span>(ANP NEEDS YOUR HELP: </span><span>Before continuing, we wanted to thank everybody who has </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/AllNewsPipeLine">donated to ANP</a><span> over the years.

bit helps more than you could know!)</span></p> <p>CRAZY PEOPLE DRAWN TO LIBERALISM? OR DOES IT MAKE THEM CRAZY? </p> <p>Some
 may think I am being snaky or sarcastic here with that question, but I 
am not. There is nothing amusing about mental health issues, but the 
question does need to be asked.</p> <p>Does liberalism draw people with 
mental health issues, or do the ideological and cultural stances of the 
Democrat/ liberal party, drive them to insanity, anxiety, and/or 
depression?</p> <p>It is a question that mental health professionals 
should be asking and studying but they do not because their industry is 
disproportionately liberal itself.</p> <p>How do you study or treat a mental problem you have?</p> <p>We
 asked that back when mental health professionals gave the name "Trump 
Anxiety Disorder," to what others referred to as Trump Derangement 
Syndrome.</p> <p>The stories reported on, with direct quotes from those 
in the mental health industry, in some cases admitting they found 
helping those afflicted difficult because they themselves were busy 
suffering from the same anxiety.</p> <p><a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2019/07/14/dc-types-flocking-shrinks-trump-therapists-miserable/">2019, via the Washingtonian</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>On
 Election Day in 2016, psychologist Julie Bindeman put on a white 
pantsuit, the outfit of choice for hardcore Hillary Clinton voters. She 
went to work excited about the prospect of America’s first female 
President. Like many therapists in Washington—in fact, all but one of 
those I contacted, at random, for this story—Bindeman votes Democratic. 
The following morning, she cried in the shower and had trouble preparing
 herself for the day.</p> <p>Once at work, Bindeman saw seven clients, 
all but one of whom wanted to talk about Donald Trump’s surprise win. “I
 had clients who were traumatized” by it, Bindeman says. “And having to 
hear it all day, there was an element of trauma that my colleagues and I
 experienced.” She left the office completely overwhelmed.</p> </blockquote> <p>How do you treat others for a condition you cannot successfully treat yourself for?</p> <p>With
 liberal, socialist, and communist indoctrination of our nation's 
students,. from pre-school to college, the numbers from studies like the
 Pew Research study cited above, will continue to rise as they have been
 over the last decades.</p> <p>As socialism and radical liberalism has 
infiltrated one complete political party and part of another in America,
 this should be treated as a national security issue. </p> <p>BOTTOM LINE</p> <p>According
 to the Pew study liberals across the board are more prone to mental 
health issues, with white liberal women showing an extreme propensity 
for a variety of mental health afflictions, such as anxiety and 
depression.</p> <p>Whether or not liberalism is the cause or the draw 
for white liberal women is something that needs unaffiliated, and 
non-political research, because at some point one of these crazy people 
are going to have access to the nuclear football.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Related: <a href="https://amzn.to/3wDckua">Liberalism Is A Mental Disorder T-Shirts</a></p> <span class="rm-manual"><span>ANP FUNDRAISER: With non-stop censorship and 'big </span>tech'
