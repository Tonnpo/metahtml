 Korean leader Kim Jong-Un salutes as he watches a military parade to 
mark 100 years since the birth of the country’s founder and his 
grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, in Pyongyang on April 15, 2012.</span></p>
<p>This week, South Korea’s defense minister revealed that the country 
has troops on standby ready to assassinate North Korean leader Kim 
Jong-un if need be.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/23/asia/south-korea-plan-to-assassinate-kim-jong-un/">CNN reports</a>,
 when South Korea’s Minister of National Defense Han Min-koo was asked 
during a session of parliament this Wednesday whether he had a plan to 
eliminate the North’s leadership, he replied, “Yes, we do have such a 
plan.”</p>
<p>He then elaborated upon the South’s overall preparedness to strike 
against the North: “South Korea has a general idea and plan to use 
precision missile capabilities to target the enemy’s facilities in major
 areas as well as eliminating the enemy’s leadership.”</p>
<p>Given the bitter, entrenched state of cold war between the two 
countries, many had long suspected that such plans were in place. But 
now, in the wake of North Korea’s most threatening nuclear test earlier 
this month, the South has stepped up their state of alert.</p>
<p>That nuclear test may very well warrant such a heightened state of 
readiness. The September 9th test marked not only North Korea’s largest 
device ever detonated but also the first time they were able to mount a 
nuclear device on a ballistic missile, which exponentially increases the
 ways in which they could actually use such a device in a nuclear 
strike.</p>
<p>Many world leaders swiftly condemned the test, with President Obama <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/asia/north-korea-seismic-activity/">stating</a>,
 “To be clear, the United States does not, and never will, accept North 
Korea as a nuclear state,” adding that North Korea will face 
“consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions.” </p>
<p>Of course, as dangerous as North Korea’s test may be to the country’s
 enemies abroad, like the United States, it’s that much more dangerous 
to the country’s neighboring enemies, like South Korea and Japan. Just 
after the test, Obama stated that he spoke with the leaders of both 
countries by phone and that they would “take additional significant 
steps, including new sanctions.”</p>
<p>However, given this week’s statements from defense minister Han 
Min-koo, we can be sure that South Korea has some even more severe 
countermeasures in mind.</p>
