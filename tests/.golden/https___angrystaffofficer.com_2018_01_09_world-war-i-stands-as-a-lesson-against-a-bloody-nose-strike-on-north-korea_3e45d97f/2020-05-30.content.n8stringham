<h1 class="rm-manual">World War I Stands as a Lesson Against a “Bloody Nose” Strike on North Korea</h1>
<p>How do you solve a problem like North Korea? This is the song that Pentagon planners have been singing for decades now.</p>
<p>We’re told that there are plans to use a limited strike on a North 
Korean target that would send a message to the dictator that the U.S. 
isn’t playing around. A strike that would hopefully not develop into a 
full blown conflict. Hopefully. But last I checked, hope wasn’t a course
 of action.</p>
<p>Thankfully, from <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/at-the-pentagon-little-appetite-for-a-bloody-nose-strike-on-north-korea/article/2645421" rel="noopener">recent news reports</a>,
 the Pentagon is not fond of what is being called the “bloody nose” 
option, for the simple reason that there is no such thing as limited 
conflicts between nation states.</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong; have limited conflicts occurred before? Yes,
 of course. Actions in Afghanistan and Iraq could properly be considered
 as “limited,” albeit somewhat open-ended. Operations in Panama and 
Grenada would also fall into that category, since those countries could 
not mount a military threat that the U.S could not conceivably control.</p>
<p>Now, some might point to Operations Desert Storm/Desert Shield as 
successful examples of military intervention in what could be considered
 a conventional war. But there’s a big difference between 1991 Iraq – 
which had been decimated by a ten year war with Iran and had terrain 
that was admirably suited for maneuver warfare – and North Korea, which 
is mountainous and has been preparing for war with South Korea and the 
U.S. since the end of the Korean War.</p>
<p>The myth of limited conflict is not new; it is tantalizing enough 
that nations have fallen for it over and over again throughout history. 
The most famous, of course, is the First World War. The Austro-Hungarian
 Empire sought to end the problem of a troublesome Serbia in 1914 
following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by declaring war
 on Serbia. The Balkans had long been a troubled hotspot of conflict, 
but these flare-ups were managed by the Great Powers and remained 
regional. Based on the failed belief that they could again limit the 
conflict, Austro-Hungary issued an ultimatum in July of 1914 that they 
knew would provoke Serbia to war. While they expected that small Serbia 
would mobilize, they didn’t expect that Serbia would then call on its 
much larger friend Russia for help. Which it did.</p>
<p>Russia then began mobilizing, so Austro-Hungary nervously asked 
Germany for help. Germany demanded that Russia cease and desist, Russia 
replied with a big ol’ middle finger, and suddenly this conflict wasn’t 
quite so regional. To make matters worse, when Germany asked France to 
remain neutral and France responded with a firm Gallic “non,” Germany 
decided to knock France out of the war quickly by going through neutral 
Belgium. Aaaaand that brought Great Britain rushing into the fight with 
all the rapidity of a sergeant major who spots troops walking across 
their grass. Hey presto, the “limited conflict” in the Balkans put all 
of Europe into war. And we know how great that turned <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I/Killed-wounded-and-missing" rel="noopener">out</a>.</p>
<p>This idea of a limited conflict is predicated on the notion that the 
enemy doesn’t get to have a say and that we can predict the reactions of
 all actors in the region. Both of these assumptions are patently and 
dangerously false. And while conflagrations on the Korean peninsula 
between the North and South since the Korean War have historically been 
well-contained by both parties, nothing is to say that a strike by the 
U.S. would follow the same path. In all likelihood, in fact, it would be
 substantially different.</p>
<p>Thinking of conflicts in merely regional terms is to ignore how 
globalization and shifting trends of political and military power 
influence our actions and our opponent’s counteractions. Merely calling a
 crisis “regional” is farcical when most nation states can project power
 at a global level. We ignore the lessons of history at our own peril. 
And to do so during the centennial of World War I is particularly 
egregious.</p>
