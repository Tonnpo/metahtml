 is a great country for many reasons, but with just 8.4 million citizens
 and locked in the center of the European continent, it is hardly a 
global player. However, even here the death of Kim Jong Il, the details 
of the mourning procedure, and the assignment of titles and functions to
 his son Kim Jong Un, were reported by almost all media as top news.</p> <p>This
 tells us something about globalization and our own profession. News is 
being produced and fed by a few globally operating press agencies that 
make hundreds of national media outlets look like clones with minor 
local mutations. It also shows how visually oriented the consumption of 
news has become. We have reason to believe that without the particular 
features of Kim Jong Il’s appearance, and without the TV broadcasts of 
thousands of ecstatic mourners [Erich Weingartner: <a href="http://38north.org/2012/01/eweingartner010512/">The reality of tears</a>],
 attention in the West would have been much lower. I was asked by one 
journalist why our public does not seem to be too worried about the 
humanitarian situation in North Korea. My answer was: because they 
cannot see it on their TV screens.</p> <p>By now, to most of our fellow 
countrymen in Austria, in Europe, in the United States or elsewhere, Kim
 Jong Il and Kim Jong Un have become just a distant memory, another blip
 in a constant flow of dramatic events. Much more substantial issues 
like the drama in Fukushima have already faded away and seem like a 
thing from a long bygone past. The public in the neighboring countries 
like South Korea, Japan and China will be more attentive, but even 
there, the initial excitement is diminishing.</p> <p>In any case, the 
media party is over, and so is the hangover. Countless interviews have 
been given and hasty commentaries written. Public interest in the West 
vanishes, but things do not stop taking shape in North Korea. A new myth
 is in the making, and we can observe it in real time. Countless 
important signals have been sent in just two weeks. They form the 
foundation of what might be a short-lived intermezzo between a 
monolithic state and its transformation, or a shaping of the North 
Korean system for the next decades. The successor has been announced, he
 has made his first steps and public appearances. New buzzwords have 
emerged in the mass media, new rituals and icons are appearing, and the 
first New Year joint editorial of Kim Jong Un’s North Korea has been 
published.</p> <p>In other words, we still know too little, but we know 
more than on Dec. 19th, the day when Kim Jong Il’s death was officially 
announced. It is thus time to take stock of what happened, of what we 
know, and of what we don’t know. This remains a complicated endeavor, 
and educated guessing is often the best we can hope for. I therefore 
begin with a short but necessary excurse into methodology.</p> <p>What does it take to be a North Korea expert?</p> <p>This
 was on the smarter side of questions I was asked during my own media 
speed battle around Dec. 19th. It is no doubt a valid one, given the 
amazing discrepancies between questions and knowledge, and between 
actual expertise and the number of experts. Having worked on North Korea
 for over 20 years now, my answer is this: There is no single factor; 
rather, it is a combination of a few components that makes a good North 
Korea expert.</p> <p>(1) Use common sense. After all, North Koreans are 
human beings and can thus be understood as such. It takes no rocket 
science to see that they need food, shelter and all the other elements 
of the basic levels of Maslow’s pyramid of needs [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">link</a>].</p> <p>(2)
 Make use of universal knowledge and meta-theories. Sometimes we become 
victims of our own propaganda and forget that despite its 
particularities, North Korea is a state in Northeast Asia. It has a 
government, a leadership, an economy, a people and a history. No 
specific expertise is needed to understand that survival is the regime’s
 key goal, and hardly any realist would have difficulties explaining 
North Korea’s foreign policy. But strangely, these simple facts are 
often either ignored or lauded as deep insights. It is not enough to 
know Korea; knowing your social science is imperative to avoid 
amateurism. American scholars, among others, have impressively 
demonstrated what can be learned about North Korea that way.</p> <p>(3) 
Know the system. North Korea is not the only place in the world where 
state socialism has been practiced. As a minimum, one should be informed
 about the functioning and the effects of a one-party state, systematic 
repression, a state-owned economy, a non-convertible currency, central 
planning, or the absence of competition and markets. Actual experience 
of having lived (in my case often frustrated, but also surprisingly 
happily) under such conditions is even more helpful. It is no 
coincidence that Russian names appear so high in the ranks of the most 
knowledgeable North Korea scholars.</p> <p>(4) Know Korea. Common sense,
 meta-theories and systemic knowledge will get us far, but not far 
enough. After all, North Korea is (North) Korea, with a history that has
 led to a unique set of institutions also known as culture, customs, 
values, and traditions. Uncritically applying our own cultural and moral
 standards as a yardstick will often lead to more or less significant 
misunderstandings. True, cultural determinism is an extreme that needs 
to be avoided; but so should ignorance. This is why South Korean 
scholars, and Chinese experts of Korean origin, are able to offer 
particularly deep insights.</p> <p>(5) Know your sources. Yes, the 
amount of foreign language materials on North Korea is increasing, and 
one can communicate with North Koreans or defectors through an 
interpreter. But if you agree that a proper understanding and 
appreciation, not to speak of expert knowledge of Shakespeare’s pieces 
requires command of English, then you will agree that Korean is 
indispensable for studying the inner workings of the North Korean 
system. That’s why Koreanists often have a competitive advantage in 
particular in the understanding of subtle messages.</p> <p>(6) Commit 
yourself. It takes time and a long-term effort to develop experience, 
the ability to see what is extraordinary, and to understand the 
background and the context of events. This is why students of any 
subject are required to read more than just one book, and why learning 
is said to be life-long. As dreadful as it often is, only a long-term 
reading of propaganda will let you see what is hidden between the lines 
(to discard this as Kremlinology reminds me of Aesop’s tale of the fox 
and the grapes). The same applies to travelling. First-time visitors to 
North Korea often feel like Columbus, discovering “new” things 
everywhere that have been seen and reported dozens of times before. Even
 if they can avoid that trap, they get just a static image, a snap-shot.
 Only going to the same places again and again will let you notice 
significant developments.</p> <p>In addition to these six points, one 
could think of other factors such as the command of Russian, Chinese or 
Japanese to have access to valuable secondary sources. Being as free as 
possible of positive or negative emotions is also helpful to minimize 
biases.</p> <p>It is admittedly very difficult to find all these 
criteria combined in one person. The list above looks more like an 
outline of the various approaches taken to North Korea. Maybe that is 
why none of us can seriously claim to possess superior knowledge or full
 understanding. But I would nevertheless argue that the above is the 
ideal that we should strive to get as close to as possible.</p> <p>With 
this in mind, what do we know about the recent events in North Korea, 
and what can be said about its future? I will structure my remarks 
according to questions I received, and statements that I encountered. 
The six points above shall serve as an implicit guideline. Your topic of
 interest is not included? Drop us a comment!</p> <p>Q&amp;A on Kim Jong Un’s North Korea</p> <p> Does Kim Jong Un have the power, and will he keep it?</p> <p>Common
 sense is a bit at a loss here. He is the son of Kim Jong Il, but only 
the third son. North Korea is not a monarchy, but we nevertheless 
witness a third-generation succession. Kim Jong Un has been announced as
 the successor and assigned a leading role, but he is very young and 
inexperienced. This list of contradictory statements can be continued, 
so it is better to turn to a more structured analysis.</p> <p>Gregory 
Henderson’s study of Korean politics suggests that the emergence of 
alternative centers of power is relatively unlikely [Gregory Henderson 
(1968): Korea. The Politics of the Vortex. Harvard University Press]. 
Rather, we can expect various individuals and groups to compete for 
control of the center, which is formed by or around Kim Jong Un. At his 
young age and with only a short grooming period, he will have to rely on
 others to maintain and expand his power. Before Kim Jong Il’s death, 
Karoly Fendler, an insightful veteran Hungarian diplomat with decades of
 experience in North Korea, in a private conversation with the author 
suggested a triumvirate: Kim Jong Il and his son responsible for army 
and ideology, Kim Yong Nam for protocol, and Choe Yong Rim for the 
economy. This makes sense in many ways. Yoram Barzel in his study on 
dictatorships points out that any dictator “must form long-term 
relations with at least some of his subjects to secure their 
cooperation”. [Barzel, Yoram (1968): The State and the Diversity of 
Third Party Enforcers. mimeo, University of Washington, p. 8]</p> <p>So 
Kim Jong Un will share power, but he is also needed by the system as a 
single leader. Brian Myers shows that Koreans seem to have a certain 
preference for a parental leader and, most importantly, that the state 
as such shows no signs of undergoing a legitimacy crisis [Myers, Brian 
R.: North Korea’s State-Loyalty Advantage. Journal of International 
Affairs, Fall/Winter 2011, Vol. 65, No. 1., pp. 115-129]. Along the same
 line, Cheong Seong-chang argues that instead of a collective 
leadership, we will see the emergence of another single-person 
leadership system under Kim Jong Un. [정성장: 2012년 북한 정세 전망, 정세와 정책 
2012년1월호, <a href="http://www.sejong.org/pub_ci/PUB_CI_DATA/k2012-01_6.PDF">link</a>]</p> <p>My
 own assessment is slightly different. True: now that the power vacuum 
left after the death of Kim Jong Il has been so quickly and massively 
filled with Kim Jong Un, he will be the man in the spotlight. But at 
least for the next few years, he will not have the capacity to control 
the country without having to rely heavily on support by powerful 
individuals. This, however, is risky. I agree with Andrei Lankov who 
expects a power struggle in NK, one level below KJU: “...we might soon 
witness advisors and officials jockeying for power behind the throne and
 their struggle may become quite violent”. [<a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/NA05Dg01.html">link</a>]</p> <p>In
 fact, I believe that the hasty efforts at elevating Kim Jong Il 
posthumously to the same status as his father Kim Il Sung might come too
 late. They are the only choice the leadership thought it had after the 
sudden death of its top man, but it is only the second best option. Kim 
Jong Il knew very well why he avoided a real take-over during his 
lifetime. His legitimacy was built almost exclusively on being the sole 
prophet of his towering father Kim Il Sung. As such, he was accepted and
 untouchable. Kim Jong Il had very good reasons not to erect any statues
 of himself, and not to give his name to streets, plazas etc.</p> <p>The
 country of Kim Il Sung - this is what most North Koreans, as defectors 
confirm - subscribe to with little hesitation. Kim Il Sung has liberated
 the country from the Japanese and won a shining victory against 
American aggression in the Korean War. This is what people have been 
told, this is what they believe, this is what in their view granted Kim 
Il Sung every right to govern the country that he singlehandedly created
 and protected. Not least, he had his old guard of loyal followers 
around him, and I mean really loyal as they had gone through all kinds 
of ordeals together ever since the days of the Minsaengdan incident, a 
massive purge of Koreans in the Chinese revolutionary forces in the 
early 1930s when they were suspected of being agents of the Japanese [<a href="http://www.researchgate.net/researcher/21143594_Hongkoo_Han">Hongkoo Han</a>
 (1999): Wounded nationalism: The Minsaengdan incident and Kim Il Sung 
in Eastern Manchuria, Seattle: University of Washington]. Parts of this 
old guard were alive and in control in 1994. But time took its toll. 
Their places have meanwhile been taken by the next, much better educated
 generation that grew up under more regular conditions. Now even the 
third generation is ready, career-oriented children of apparatchiks. Can
 they replicate the Kapsan faction’s unconditional, grim personal 
loyalty? Or is their primary concern the preservation of the system that
 has formed them and that they benefit from? Make no mistake, both forms
 of loyalty can have the same result, i.e. support of the leader. But 
the latter form is open to alternatives.</p> <p>For two decades since 
the mid 1970s, Kim Jong Il was promoted as the only person in the world 
who could fully grasp the wisdom of Kim Il Sung, who joined him on his 
numerous journeys through the country, who learned from him (or should 
it be Him?), who assisted him, and who then humbly continued his work. 
Kim Jong Il’s position after 1994 was weaker than that of his father, 
but he could convincingly claim to be the only logical choice for the 
continuation of a path and leadership that was largely undisputed and 
beyond any doubt. And he could count on the old guard to support him.</p> <p>One
 does not need to be a North Korea expert to understand that the same 
degree of legitimacy simply cannot be passed on to Kim Jong Un. Kim Jong
 Il did not fight against Japan, but he was at least (allegedly) born at
 Mt. Paektu. Kim Jong Il for a long time in his career was a moon, not a
 sun. He shone because Kim Il Sung was shining on him, and he reflected 
his light. This was part of the “text”, as Brian Myers calls it. But how
 can a moon illuminate the next generation as brightly as a sun could?</p> <p>The
 trouble is that even dictators need legitimacy. The logical choice 
would have been to enshrine the two eternal leaders, father Kim Il Sung 
and son Kim Jong Il, forever and create a system that would claim to 
fulfill their legacy in the most perfect way. This would require a 
collective of trustees with a primus inter pares at their helm, very 
much like China’s Central Committee and the Party’s General Secretary, 
or the Catholic Church and the Pope. God and Jesus, Allah and Mohammed, 
Lenin and Stalin - religion and history know many relatively successful 
cases where after only one successor, a new collective mode of 
leadership was chosen.</p> <p>However, Kim Jong Il’s untimely death 
means that a backup plan is now being implemented - hastily, massively, 
too quickly. Suddenly we hear about Kim Jong Il country, about the need 
to erect statues to his honor, about Kim Jong Un being Kim Jong Il, 
about Kim Jong Un being the supreme leader of the Party, the state, and 
the military. But will this be enough? The North Korean population does 
not consist of mindless robots. They are well educated, and they are 
tough. The elite have acquired self-confidence and power in the last 
years. They know their country has problems. They desperately want a 
solution. And so far they have little reason to believe that Kim Jong Un
 is the right man for the job.</p> <p> How is Kim Jong Un’s legitimacy being built?</p> <p>Any
 leader, in any political system, needs legitimacy to maintain his claim
 to power. Not incidentally did Max Weber [Weber, Max (1972): Wirtschaft
 und Gesellschaft. Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, p. 122] suggest use of the 
claim to legitimacy as the sole criterion for classifying various types 
of rule. It would be outright naive to expect that all it takes in North
 Korea is an article in the Rodong Sinmun, and everyone will stop asking
 questions and just follow the new top man.</p> <p>Legitimacy in 
autocratic systems is a tricky issue. It is hard to acquire, and it 
lacks a mechanism of permanent renewal (like elections in democracies). 
Merkel [Wolfgang Merkel (1999). Systemtransformation. Opladen, Germany: 
Leske+Budrich, pp. 25-28] associates North Korea with the 
Communist-totalitarian subtype, not with a monarchy. Bursens and 
Sinardet [Peter Bursens and Dave Sinardet, Democratic Legitimacy in 
Multilevel Political Systems: The European Union and Belgium in 
Comparative Perspective. Paper presented at the European Union Studies 
Association 11th Biennial International Conference, May 23-25, 2007, Los
 Angeles] show that there are two interrelated sides to legitimacy. In 
addition to the expected outcomes, an important source of legitimacy 
seems to be that the decision-making process including the selection of 
the leadership follows approved rules.</p> <p>My own research confirms 
that legitimacy in North Korea is performance-based, and that this 
includes a certain compliance with rules and formalities. This is why 
Kim Jong Un is still addressed with the title Vice Chairman of the WPK 
Central Military Commission. This is why the eldest son Kim Jong Nam is 
so obviously unqualified for the post: he does not behave in a way that 
would be regarded as sufficiently dignified. On a side note, my 
suspicion is that he did so purposefully: what is better than being the 
offspring of a rich and powerful family, without the burden of actual 
government and the permanent power struggle behind the scenes? What a 
smart decision.</p> <p>As indicated above, Kim Il Sung based his claim 
to power on his feats including the liberation of Korea from the 
Japanese, and the victory in a war of defense of Korea against an 
invasion by the United States. As so often, what matters is not the 
actual truth of such claims, but their perception by the target group, 
i.e. the North Korean population. Kim Jong Il, too, had to earn the 
right to rule. He was given a number of tasks to prove that he was 
capable. This included most prominently work in the film studios and the
 development of the chuch’e ideology as the country’s guiding principle.
 He went through a rather long period of training and grooming before he
 was designated as successor at the 6th Party Congress in 1980. Ever 
since, he was portrayed as a tireless worker on behalf of the people. 
Take for example a 1980 painting shown at the North Korean art 
exhibition in Vienna in 2010, titled: The endlessly burning light of the
 Party Center (a codeword for Kim Jong Il at that time).</p> <p>Another example shows him caring for the livelihood of soldiers:</p> <p>But
 what about Kim Jong Un? He had little time to accomplish any major 
feat, or claim to have done so, although there are unproven rumors that 
he was involved in a number of military operations vis-à-vis South 
Korea. We could thus in the days after the announcement of Kim Jong Il’s
 death observe a massive, multi-layered strategy to build at least a 
provisional legitimacy for Kim Jong Un. I can only agree with Ken 
Gause’s assesment: “the regime appears to have launched a blitz campaign
 to portray him as the legitimate successor to his father, removing any 
doubt within the mind of the public and elite alike over who is in 
charge“ [<a href="http://blog.keia.org/2012/01/kim-chong-un-and-pyongyangs-signaling-campaign">link</a>].</p> <p>It
 started with the inclusion of him as the “great successor” in the 
official obituary. The very moment North Koreans learned that Kim Jong 
Il was dead, they were also told who was going to be his heir. Note that
 Kim Jong Un had not been announced to be in that position during Kim 
Jong Il’s lifetime; it was the Party who acted as the Kingmaker [<a href="http://38north.org/2011/12/rfrank122111/">link</a>]. Even the introduction of Kim Jong Un to the public was done in the context of a Party Conference [<a href="http://38north.org/2010/10/1451">link</a>].</p> <p>Then,
 a sense of guilt was instilled in the people. The very circumstances of
 Kim Jong Il’s demise on the way to another on-the-spot guidance 
suggested that he worked himself to death for the people. The 
appropriate reaction is reported by none other than the Associated 
Press, which was told by the Vice Minister of Mining Industry Pak Thae 
Gu: "We lost the great Kim Jong Il because we did not do our work well. 
How can we have a rest?" [The Guardian, 01.01.2012, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10019703">link</a>].
 This theme - which is Korean, not North Korean - was repeated a couple 
of times in KCNA and Rodong Sinmun reporting. Particularly noteworthy 
was the regret expressed by citizens about having failed to erect a 
statue of Kim Jong Il during his lifetime. We can expect Kim Jong Un to 
take up this task very soon.</p> <p>Next came portrayals of Kim Jong 
Un’s caring love for the people. Two examples stood out: the provision 
of fresh fish to the citizens of Pyongyang, and the provision of hot 
drinks for mourners [장군님께서 오시였다!, <a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/calendar/2011/12/12-25/2011-1225-010.html">link</a>]
 (some interesting details regarding North Korea’s middle class that 
emerged in related reporting will be discussed below). This was mixed 
with references to Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un being one inseparable 
entity. In principle, this is very much the procedure followed through a
 generation earlier, when the transfer of legitimacy from Kim Il Sung to
 Kim Jong Il took place.</p> <p>Over the next days, Kim Jong Un was 
assigned various titles and functions. The functions included: successor
 to the revolutionary cause of Juche (주체혁명위업의 계승자), standing at the helm
 of the Korean revolution, the head (수반) of the WPK Central Committee, 
the Great Sun of the 21st Century (21세기의 태양), reputable leader of our 
Party, State and Army (우리 당과 국가, 군대의 영명한 령도자), supreme leader (최고령도자) of
 Party, state and army, and supreme commander of the Korean People's 
Army. The latter, interestingly, was announced to have happened before 
Kim Jong Il’s death on Oct. 8th, 2011.</p> <p>However, the only formal 
title he holds and that is repeated constantly is that of Vice Chairman 
of the WPK Central Military Commission (조선로동당 중앙군사위원회 부위원장). By early 
January 2012, the title “Dear respected Comrade Kim Jong Un“ (경애하는 
김정은동지) has become a standard form of address.</p> <p>All this was an ad 
hoc reaction. A look at the frequency of KCNA reporting about Kim Jong 
Il and Kim Jong Un in the table below reveals that the departure of the 
leader was unexpected for the North Korean propaganda machine. With the 
exception of July, the average monthly number of articles with Kim Jong 
Un’s name was less than 10 until November 2011, as opposed to over 300 
for Kim Jong Il. The total number of such appearances in 2011 until 
November was 141 for Kim Jong Un and 3471 for Kim Jong Il. This suggests
 that the campaign to promote Kim Jong Un has not even remotely been in 
full swing.</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p>Number of KCNA articles with the names of Kim Jong Un and Kim Jong Il, Jan.-Dec. 2011 (not weighted)</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>We
 have other indications that the succession was unexpected and 
ill-prepared. It seems there weren’t even enough of the classic 
father-and-son pictures taken, a motive we have known from Kim Il Sung 
and Kim Jong Il. Take the stamps issued on Dec. 30th, 2011. One of them 
shows an image of Kim Jong Un with his father during a field inspection 
against the backdrop of the revolution’s sacred Mt. Paektu. The Korea 
Times writes that this image is an attempt at justifying the 
third-generation hereditary transfer of power [Korea Times, 31.12.2011, <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/12/120_101973.html">link</a>].
 It is hard to object; what I find remarkable, however, is the obvious 
and hasty editing that has taken place (others are erased, Kim Jong Un 
is moved closer to his father, shadows remain intact). If this is such a
 central element in building Kim Jong Un’s legitimacy, why hasn’t the 
propaganda machine produced dozens of father-and-son pictures in time?</p> <p> Do the Party and the military compete for power in North Korea?</p> <p>This
 is one of the most commonly made assumptions about power in North 
Korea: that the military and the party compete. Our minds seem to have a
 general inclination towards simple dichotomies: good and evil, black 
and white, civilians and military, yin and yang, sweet and sour, man and
 woman and so forth. I am afraid that this predisposition is responsible
 for a great deal of the popularity of the “military versus party” 
theory. To put it very bluntly: I disagree.</p> <p>The reasons for this 
are manifold. To begin with, it is hard to imagine that a reasonable 
dictator would allow the military to become a political force in his 
country. He will use the military as a tool, he will stress military 
values like hierarchy, obedience of orders, and self-sacrifice. All 
socialist societies that we have known used militant language (the 
economic front, shock brigade, fresh advance, speed-battle, struggle 
etc.). They all had large militaries, huge budgets (alas, this is what 
eventually broke their economies’ backs), para-military training, a 
preference for uniforms, mass rallies and marches. Leonid Brezhnev often
 wore a military uniform, and he was surrounded by Generals.</p> <p>I 
spent five years as a child in his Soviet Union in the 1970s. Despite my
 German parents’ disapproval, I grew up there playing military games, 
reading military stories, watching military movies, and wearing a school
 uniform. Each year, the Red Square in Moscow hosted military parades of
 a scale that easily let anything we have seen in Pyongyang pale in 
comparison. Tanks, artillery, gigantic missiles and goose-stepping 
soldiers were passing by an embalmed Lenin. Still, few observers would 
have characterized the Soviet Union as a country ruled by the military. 
Ruled through the military, maybe, but not a military dictatorship.</p> <p>North
 Korea is admittedly an extreme case; but it iw not unique. Part of our 
perception problem is that since 1991, it is the only such system that 
is left. Many of those who today watch parades on Kim Il Sung square 
have no memory of any similar case and easily think that nothing like 
this has existed on earth before. Well, wrong. Extreme, 
North-Koreanized: yes. But unique: no.</p> <p>Most seasoned observers of
 North Korea agree that the country is ruled by a kleptocracy. It 
consists of a few families, including the one of Kim Il Sung and of 
those 50 comrades who entered the country with him in late 1945. This 
top elite has had seven decades to settle in. It assumed control of all 
positions of power, be it the Party, the military, the security organs, 
the state, or the parliament. They intermarried, they produced 
offspring, they expanded. This is in no way unique. In medieval Europe, 
it was common to marry within the aristocracy, to have at least one son 
becoming a knight, and another a cleric. In North Korea, it is the same 
families that control the Party and the military. If there is any 
rivalry, and we have no reason to believe that there is none, it will be
 between the families, not between the institutions. It will be army 
units against army units, Party leaders against Party leaders, 
ministries against ministries; not army against Party.</p> <p>Another 
fact that seems hard to grasp for Westerners is that the glue that holds
 North Korea together is not direct repression, but ideology. This is 
not to say that North Korea is not a highly repressive system; of course
 it is. This repression is systemic, and it is omnipresent. But it is 
not the only and probably not even the most powerful element of regime 
stability. It is no coincidence that Kim Jong Il identified ideological 
weakness as the reason for the collapse of socialism in Europe [<a href="http://www.korea-dpr.com/lib/101.pdf">link</a>].
 And indeed, North Korea is particularly strong in this respect. It has 
successfully merged anti-Japanese and anti-American nationalism, the 
fear to again lose independence, a crude type of Leninism, xenophobia 
(Myers calls this racism) and traditional familism into one.</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p>Use of key ideological terms in KCNA articles, 1997-2010 (weighted and rounded)</p> <p>Source: author’s own calculations, based on www.kcna.co.jp</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>As
 the graph above shows, the use of typical North Korean orthodox and 
conservative terminology, exemplified by the words “socialism” and 
“juche”, has declined after 2000 but picked up since 2005. The new term 
“songun” was added in 2003 and developed in line with the other terms. 
All three have developed more or less in parallel throughout most of the
 observation period, with correlation coefficients [We use Pearson’s 
Product Moment Correlation, also known as Person’s r. Values for r range
 from +1 to -1. A correlation of +1 means that there is a perfect 
positive linear relationship between variables, 0 indicates no 
correlation, and -1 implies a perfect negative linear relationship.] 
ranging from r=0.7 to as much as r=0.9 for socialism/songun in the 
2004-2010 period. In 2010, however, we see a slight drop year-on-year of
 the use of “socialism” and “songun”, but an increase in the nationalist
 term “juche”.</p> <p>For the ordinary North Korean, the leader and 
socialism are the same as national independence and the nation. The 
latter are beyond any doubt, and so are automatically the former. And 
the owner of ideology is the Party. For reasons that are subject to 
speculation, the Party was pushed into the background for a while, but 
not by the military. Rather, it was the leader himself who after having 
solidified his position decided to put a check on this powerful 
institution. The graph below shows this; in 2000, Kim Jong Il almost 
stopped using his Party title for a few years, which coincide with a 
period of unfinished economic reform.</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p>Use of key titles for Kim Jong Il in KCNA articles, 1997-2010 (weighted and rounded)</p> <p>Source: author’s own calculations, based on www.kcna.co.jp</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>For
 the period 1997-2010, we see a strongly negative correlation (r = 
-0.72) in the use of what we could classify as a worldly, 
management-oriented title (Great Leader, 위대한 령도자) and a spiritual, 
ideologically oriented title (Secretary General, 총비서). Two points stand 
out: the clear identification of the reform period 2001-2006, when the 
negative correlation gets close to perfect at r = -0.90, and the new 
heights the mentioning of Kim Jong Il in his function as the Party’s 
General Secretary has reached since 2008, the year of his alleged 
stroke.</p> <p>My interpretation in 2003 of the Military First Policy 
was not that of a radical turn towards militarism; how much more 
militaristic could North Korea become anyway? Rather, I suggested seeing
 it as the ideological component of a market-oriented economic reform 
drive that the Party obviously opposed [<a href="http://www.nautilus.org/publications/books/dprkbb/transition/Ruediger_Socialism.html">The End of Socialism and a Wedding Gift for the Groom? The True Meaning of the Military First Policy</a>,
 NAPSNET Special Report and DPRK Briefing Book, Dec. 11th, 2003]. Then, 
in 2008, I noticed unusually enthusiastic reporting about the Party 
Foundation Monument [<a href="file:///-Ruediger-Frank/2930">Has the Next North Korean Leader Been Announced?</a>,
 Japan Focus, No. 43, 27.10.2008] and interpreted this as the expression
 of a decision on a new, collective leadership model. In 2010, the WPK 
experienced another significant formal upgrading of its role with the 
Party Conference, where its power organs were rejuvenated and its status
 was reconfirmed. Very recently, the WPK Central Committee even managed 
to squeeze itself into a slogan that for years existed without it: 
“Let’s protect the Central Committee of the Party with Kim Jong Il as 
its head with our lives”. The last time the formulation “the WPK Central
 Committee headed by Secretary Kim Jong Il” was used was in autumn 1997.
 It only reemerged on Sept. 29, 2010 in connection with the WPK 
Conference. In the 13 years in between, this and similar slogans were 
used without reference to the Central Committee.</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p>Picture published by KCNA on the occasion of a troop visit by Kim Jong Il on Dec. 13th, 2011</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>After
 Dec. 19th, the state media picked up this slogan and substituted Kim 
Jong Il by Kim Jong Un. On a side note, however, it seems that part of 
the country was lagging behind in the implementation of that change. On 
the picture below, published by KCNA on the occasion of one of the first
 troop visits by the new leader, Kim Jong Il’s name was still there.</p> <p>A
 strong signal regarding power in North Korea was sent through the very 
funeral held on Dec. 28th. Based on our stereotypical knowledge, what 
would we expect? Kim Jong Il, Great General, the man of the Military 
First Era era, would get a military ceremony with soldiers carrying his 
coffin, or would it be mounted on a gun carriage or even a tank? Well, 
none of this happened, as we know. The whole ceremony was largely 
civilian, except the salute shots.</p> <p>Most important, however, is 
this. If a country’s leader dies, wouldn’t his body usually be wrapped 
in the national flag? Not in this case. Kim Jong Il’s coffin was covered
 by the flag of mother Party. How much more do we need to understand 
where power resides in North Korea?</p> <p>The Worker’s Party controls 
the governmental institutions including economic and foreign policy, and
 it controls the military. This, too, is not at all an exception. Ever 
since Lenin took over power in the middle of the World War and thus 
could not afford disbanding the Tsarist army and killing its officers, 
political officers aka Commissars were put alongside military men down 
to the lower levels of military hierarchy in the Red Army. Each and 
every officer in East Germany’s National People’s Army was also a Party 
member who had two lines of command to follow. North Korea is no 
different.</p> <p>In his analysis of the role of the Central Military 
Commission (CMC) since its establishment in 1962, Cheong Song-chang 
shows not only that the CMC has played a particular role within the 
Party structure, but also that the Party hierarchy has been superior to 
the military hierarchy. His analysis of the relationship between the 
Central Committee and the CMC, however, implies a power struggle within 
the Party, which makes sense in light of our above remarks on familism. 
[Cheong, Seong-chang: The Status and Role of the WPK Central Military 
Commission in the Kim Jong-il Era, Vantage Point, 11/2001, pp. 48-59]</p> <p>If
 you look for a much more typical example of a military dictatorship, 
South Korea in 1961 would come to mind. A young general named Park 
Chung-hee assumed power through a coup, took off the uniform after a 
while but ruled the country with an iron fist while relying on his army 
networks. He was assassinated by his Intelligence Chief in 1979, only to
 be followed by two more generals, the last of whom ensured a smooth 
transition to a democracy after 1987. I believe that this experience 
compels many Korea watchers to apply a similar logic to North Korea. But
 despite the obvious militarism and the iron fisted rule, North Korea is
 not a military dictatorship; rather, it is an extreme case of a 
state-socialist autocracy in a constant state of emergency and under 
quasi-martial law.</p> <p> How will China behave?</p> <p>China is often 
portrayed in Western media as North Korea’s only ally. This is hard to 
deny but it is only one side of the coin. History knows very few cases 
where the relationship between a gigantic and a small neighbor has been 
positive from the perspective of both sides. The two countries have a 
long tradition of close cooperation, but also of tensions and mistrust. 
In the 16th century, China was Korea’s ally but only sent troops after 
Toyotomi Hideyoshi had occupied half of Korea. Elder brother China 
failed as Korea’s protector in the late 19th century, which led to 
colonization by Japan. China came to the rescue of North Korea in the 
Korean War, but not entirely free of selfish concerns, and it stayed 
until the late 1950s. A coup against Kim Il Sung during a trip to Europe
 in 1956 was led by pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese Koreans. During the 
Cultural Revolution, Chinese Red Guards heavily criticized Kim Il Sung 
and his leadership style, and even tried to trigger a similar movement 
in North Korea. There were territorial conflicts involving, among 
others, the sacred Mt. Paektu. Beijing’s claim that the ancient Kingdom 
of Koguryŏ was actually Chinese prompted outrage in both Koreas. The 
reforms in the neighboring country are met with a mix of fascination and
 suspicion, and China’s obvious hyper-presence in today’s North Korean 
economy worries many Koreans.</p> <p>Given North Korea’s nationalist 
ideology and its fear of external interference, China looks like more 
the biggest threat than the best friend. The massive economic dependence
 on China only supports that feeling of malaise. Yonhap News reported on
 Dec. 29th that in the first ten months of 2011, China's trade with 
North Korea jumped 73.5 percent year-on-year to reach a new record high 
of 4.67 billion US$ [<a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/business/2011/12/29/0502000000AEN20111229001500320.HTML">link</a>].
 In particular, China increased its imports - anthracite coal, alloy and
 non-alloy steel - from North Korean by a whopping 124.8 percent last 
year. North Korea's trade reliance on China jumped from 25 percent in 
1999 to 83 percent in 2011. The next largest trading partner in 2010 was
 Russia - with a mere 2.6% of the total! [KOTRA (2011): 2010 북한의 대외무역 
동향, KOTRA 자료 11-033, Seoul: KOTRA].</p> <p>When I first visited North 
Korea in 1991, most foreign-made goods, if there were any, came from 
Japan. By contrast, in 2010, the whole country seemed to be flooded with
 Chinese goods of all types, from textiles to cars, repair shops, and 
restaurants.</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p>Photo: Rudiger Frank 2010</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The
 Pyongyang International Trade Fair was dominated by Chinese firms 
selling computers, home appliances, trucks and all other kinds of 
products. The few Western companies had only very humble presences. 
Mutual suspicion prevails. Chinese are still often called by the 
derogatory term 돼넘 in private conversations, while Chinese businessmen 
complained about the low willingness of their North Korean partners to 
adhere to contracts.</p> <p>Officially, it is all friendship; just as it
 was between the Soviet Union and its satellite states. If you have a 
chance, ask a Hungarian or a Czech how they really felt about their Big 
Brother. I remember how “die Freunde” (the friends) was used in an 
openly ironic way when referring to Russians in East Germany. In 2010, 
the mass spectacle Arirang contained a full chapter only on 조중친성 (North 
Korea-China friendship). Here, too, the North Koreans could not refrain 
from issuing a side blow by showing a slogan from the Cultural 
Revolution: If there were no Communist Party, there would be no New 
China. This can be interpreted as indirectly accusing Beijing of having 
betrayed what Mao had fought for.</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p>Photo: Rudiger Frank 2010</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Be
 it true friendship or a rational alliance: In the context of its 
regional and global strategy, China is primarily interested in a stable 
North Korea. A collapse would bring Beijing into a complicated 
situation. If it sent in troops, this would trigger angry reactions 
worldwide and, in an instant, would discredit all of the past decade’s 
painstaking attempts at portraying the giant’s rise as peaceful. But if 
it just watched the existing order disintegrate, Korea would quickly be 
reunified under South Korean leadership, which means an expansion of the
 U.S. zone of influence right up until China’s Northeastern border. This
 would be a strategic disaster. Not least, the thus proven inability to 
save a client state would drastically reduce the PRC’s chances to 
convince any other smaller country to trade protection by Washington 
against protection by Beijing. Dreams to become a regional superpower 
would be set back. We should also not forget that the North Korean 
nuclear program can be used in various ways. Deterrence against China is
 not the most publicized option in our Western media, but that does not 
mean that Chinese are not nervous about this dangerous possession in the
 hands of its unruly neighbor.</p> <p>It was therefore little surprise 
that China was quick to express support for the new leadership in North 
Korea. The Korea Development Institute on Jan. 1st, 2012, declared that 
it expects China to provide economic assistance to North Korea in the 
near future to help stabilize its socialist neighbor. [<a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/business/2012/01/01/0503000000AEN20120101001400315.HTML">link</a>]</p> <p>We
 can also expect a continuation of the policy of the past years: 
Invitations to the leader and high level North Korean officials; tours 
of Shenyang, Beijing, and Shanghai; the building of personal networks 
with the North Korean elite; and patience. Only if Pyongyang is seen as 
going too far, for example in the nuclear question, will Beijing 
interfere - but as quietly as possible. Meanwhile, new economic zones 
will be built, old ones rejuvenated. It seems that the allegedly 
Communist Chinese trust the transformatory power of the market more than
 the capitalist West does. The world is an ironic place.</p> <p> What will happen to North Korea’s nuclear program?</p> <p>Common
 sense suggests that a change in policy would require a change in 
conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that any of the 
rationales for the nuclear program’s existence has changed. North Korea 
uses its nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence according to the same 
logic as it was applied during the Cold War between East and West. The 
program is one of the few major achievements that Kim Jong Il could 
present to his people, and Kim Jong Un will not be stupid enough to shed
 it as long as he builds his legitimacy on the legacy of his father. 
Most importantly, the nuclear program keeps the neighbors worried and 
the world interested. This attention translates into diplomatic and 
economic gains that are desperately needed. Last but not least, this is 
about the only way North Korea can provide some counterbalance to the 
massive weight of China. The South Korean public seems to share my 
pessimism. In a poll conducted in November 2011, over 80 percent of 
respondents believed North Korea will not abandon its nuclear weapons. 
[국민 81%, 북한 핵포기 안할것, Hanguk Ilbo, 02.01.2012, <a href="http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/politics/201201/h2012010209093321000.htm">link</a>]</p> <p>On
 the other hand, before Kim Jong Il died, a new round of talks was on 
the horizon. The experience of 1994 shows that despite the death of the 
supreme leader (July 1994), major progress can be achieved (Framework 
Agreement in October 1994). None of the official announcements since 
Dec. 19th 2011 includes any reference to nuclear weapons; neither 
directly nor implicitly through using code words (invincible might백승의 
위력, treasured sword위력한 보검). According to Yoo Ho-yeol, this leaves room 
for the chance of improved ties with the United States. [The Guardian, 
01.01.2012, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/01/north-korea-new-year-message">link</a>]</p> <p>Last,
 but not least: the biggest danger stemming from the North Korean 
nuclear program might not be its military use. As the events in Japan in
 March 2011 have shown, even in rich and technologically highly 
developed economies, accidents cannot be excluded. We can only hope that
 maintenance work is done properly, and that the nuclear facilities do 
not become the target of any natural or man-made disaster.</p> <p> What will Kim Jong Un’s policy be?</p> <p>Obviously,
 very little aside from “continuity” can be said at this point. It is 
also easy to see that he must find a way to resolve his country’s 
economic shortages. From the study of socialist systems done by Janos 
Kornai [Kornai, Janos (1992). The Socialist System: The Political 
Economy of Communism. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press] and 
others, we know that such shortage is chronic and systemic. In other 
words, it requires a change of the system rather than mere coping 
measures. True, North Korea was able to survive for a rather long time 
on a muddle-though strategy. But this does not change the fact that it 
is unsustainable. The Chinese example is the obvious solution, but will 
Kim Jong Un be willing, able, and allowed to follow it?</p> <p>For the 
time being, we find a number of indicators that the economic well-being 
of his people is one of his top priorities. Remember that his 
introduction as successor on Dec. 19th was soon supplemented by news 
like this: “Leader Kim Jong Il, who had always been concerned for fish 
supply to Pyongyang citizens, took a measure for fish supply on the 
evening of December 16, a day before his demise. Respected Comrade Kim 
Jong Un, who has been overcome with the deepest grief at his demise, 
took all necessary measures to truck fresh fish to the capital city in 
time and supply the fish to the citizens even in the mourning period.” [<a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2011/201112/news23/20111223-55ee.html">link</a>]</p> <p>This
 was followed by reports on the provision of hot water for mourners. On 
January 3rd, 2012, the third Pyongyang Department Store No. 1 goods 
exhibition was held [제 3차 평양제 1 백화점 상품전시회 개막, Rodong Sinmun, 04.01.2012,
 p. 3]. In the related article, Kim Jong Un is quoted with a number of 
remarks in the spirit of his father who had the previous exhibition held
 in July 2011. In other words, this emphasis on consumer goods is 
relatively recent, and it is upheld by Kim Jong Un.</p> <p>To add one 
more hint at the future policy: At the mass rally held on Dec. 30th, two
 slogans were displayed prominently (and carried in the North Korean 
media). They read: “Improvement of People’s Living Conditions”, and “The
 Principle of Light Industry First”.</p> <p>Looking at the slogan to the
 left, have you noted the replacement of “Strong and Prosperous Great 
Country” (강성대국) with “Building an Economically Strong Country” (강경국가 
건설)? Again, we must be careful not to jump to premature conclusions, but
 as a matter of fact, the central slogan of the past years has been 
modified in a way that emphasized the economy and drops military might.</p> <p>The
 emphasis on light industry and agriculture, i.e. consumer goods, is 
also reflected in a new buzzword that emerged in close connection with 
the succession: “flames of Hamnam” (함남의 불길). It was first mentioned in 
Rodong Sinmun on Oct. 26th [<a href="http://www.rodong.rep.kp/srchview.php?gno=13&amp;srchcont=%ED%95%A8%EB%82%A8%EC%9D%98%20%EB%B6%88%EA%B8%B8&amp;dF=&amp;srchkey=1">link</a>]
 and refers to an on-the-spot guidance by Kim Jong Il in October 2011. 
The 2012 New Year Joint Editorial says: “The flames of Hamnam for great 
innovation should flare up more fiercely in the sectors of light 
industry and agriculture, the leading sectors for the building of a 
thriving country”. On Youtube, you can find a song emphasizing the role 
of the youth in building the economy [소개편집물 우리도 함남의 불길이 되리 함경남도청년들, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3wRCRdEh4w">link</a>]</p> <p>This
 reference to economic policies, the improvement of the living standard,
 the production of consumer goods and the satisfaction of the citizen’s 
material needs is no coincidence. Kim Jong Un and those behind him know 
their country well, and they are aware of what even we outsiders can 
note with a sharp eye. Among the many examples are two still images I 
generated from official KCNA video footage on the mourning. Even this 
carefully assembled reporting provides interesting insights into how 
North Korea’s society is changing.</p> <p>Aside from the regular 
pictures of orderly lined-up masses, a solemn atmosphere and citizens 
overcome with grief, there was a TV interview with a lady in one of the 
shops where fresh fish was distributed. She could hardly hold back her 
tears when praising the two leaders for taking such good care of their 
people. What struck me, however, was the fact that her haircut was very 
similar to what we would expect from a South Korea woman of her age, and
 the fact that she had obviously undergone a form of “enhancement” that 
is extremely popular in SOUTH Korea: eyelid surgery. Is this so common 
now among middle-class women in Pyongyang that the state TV did not even
 notice?</p> <p>This was not the only example. Among the masses standing
 at the roadside when Kim Jong Il’s hearse passed by, one could find 
images of women with dyed hair and a haircut that in no way complied 
with “our style”.</p> <p>Care is advised not to overstate the importance
 of such examples, but they provide a stark contrast to the image 
produced by the North Korean state, and readily accepted by Western 
media, of uniformity and lack of individuality. As anyone who has been 
visiting North Korea in the past decades can confirm: this country is 
changing rapidly, self-confidence and individualism are growing, and a 
middle class has emerged. The old leadership initiated this process and 
then struggled to find a way to deal with the phenomenon. The new 
leadership has the task to continue this search for a way to move 
forward, to accommodate the demands of its citizens. All this must be 
done without being self-destructive. This is clearly not an easy task.</p> <p> Conclusion: What should we expect for 2012?</p> <p>The
 year 2012 will no doubt be an interesting one for North Korea and its 
observers. The first thing in chronological order would be the birthday 
of the new leader. In past years, it was reported that it is on January 
8th. Filial piety would suggest restraint, but no mentioning at all 
could best be explained by the lack of time for a proper preparation. Or
 maybe we got the date wrong?</p> <p>Next on the list is February 16th, 
the 70th birthday of the late Kim Jong Il. This would be a good occasion
 to unveil the first statue, and to assign him the title Eternal General
 (thus also having a chance to lay the Military First Policy to an 
honorable rest). As the benefactor of the Korean people, Kim Jong Un 
will hand out presents and extra food rations to his citizens and loyal 
followers.</p> <p>We already learned from official publications that the
 100th birthdays of the country’s founder Kim Il Sung on April 15th will
 be celebrated despite the demise of his successor and eldest son.</p> <p>This
 leads us to the question of the formalization of Kim Jong Un’s rule. If
 he and his supporters manage to consolidate his power, at some point he
 needs to be given official and formal titles. The two on the list are 
General Secretary of the KWP, and Chairman of the National Defense 
Commission. On the other hand, Kim Jong Un must show proper piety to his
 father so as to earn the respect by Korea’s tradition-oriented 
citizens. Let’s not forget that Kim Jong Il only became Secretary 
General of the Party in 1997, after a three year mourning period for Kim
 Il Sung was over.</p> <p>In any case, given the role as Kingmaker 
played by the Party so far, the 7th Party Congress of the WPK - whenever
 it takes place - would be an appropriate event to assign Kim Jong Un 
the title of Secretary General. If another mode is chosen, or if he is 
not assigned this title at all, we will have to ask ourselves why and 
what this tells us about Party support.</p> <p>In 1998, the constitution
 was changed to make Kim Il Sung the Eternal President of the country, 
and to elevate the role of the National Defense Commission Chairman. 
Another amendment is not impossible, and a similar honor could be given 
to Kim Jong Il. The post held by Kim Jong Un could be upgraded.</p> <p>On
 the policy side, it is fair to say at this point that a quick 
improvement of relations with Lee Myung-bak’s South Korea is not on the 
top of the to-do list of Kim Jong Un. The accusations of disrespectful 
behavior have become so massive that we can only hope this to be the 
usual bellicose rhetoric, and not the prelude to another military 
incident. However, unification remains a state goal, and South Korea is 
the most natural cooperation partner for economic exchanges. The latter 
are crucial for achieving the promised improvement in the North Korean 
people’s living standard. I would thus be rather optimistic about the 
prospects of an inter-Korean reconciliation. Whether this will happen 
under the current president is, however, questionable.</p> <p>This means
 that for the time being, dependence on China as the only significant 
economic partner will remain high or even grow. Neither Seoul nor 
Pyongyang will be too happy about this, and alternatives will be 
actively sought. This opens new opportunities for Russia, the United 
States, and the EU. I would also keep a close eye on Southeast Asia and 
the Middle East.</p> <p>However, a President Obama running against a 
conservative challenger will probably avoid anything that could be 
interpreted as appeasement and lack of toughness. The EU is more than 
ever preoccupied with itself. Another open window of opportunity might 
thus end up being closed unused, and North Korea could apply its old and
 proven strategies to keep us attentive. This includes the nuclear card 
in all of its variations.</p> <p>Looking further into the future, 
missing the potential for improvement might turn out particularly 
unfortunate. If Kim Jong Un manages to survive the first years in power,
 he will gradually but steadily tighten his grip on the Party and the 
families. He will get rid of opponents, increase his group of loyalists,
 and thus weaken the institutions that at this moment seem to enjoy more
 power than they had in North Korea’s history at any time since 1956. 
The quasi-collective leadership we are faced with right now will over 
the years turn into another one-person dictatorship as in the past. 
Unless the world seizes this opportunity for a breakthrough in 
relations, we might soon find ourselves in the same situation as it used
 to be in the past decades, with the same problems - except that, in the
 meanwhile, they might have grown in size.</p> <p class="rm-manual"><a href="http://wirtschaft.ostasien.univie.ac.at/">Ruediger Frank</a>
