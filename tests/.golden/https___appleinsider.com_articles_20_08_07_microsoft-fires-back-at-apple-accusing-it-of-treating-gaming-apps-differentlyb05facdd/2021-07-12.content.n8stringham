<p class="rm-manual"> By <a href="https://appleinsider.com/editor/Mike+Peterson">Mike Peterson</a> <span> | Aug 07, 2020</span> </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Aug 07, 2020</p>
<p>Hour after Apple explained why Microsoft's xCloud wouldn't be coming 
to iOS, Microsoft shot back and accused the company of "consistently 
treating gaming apps differently." </p>
<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft ended its xCloud TestFlight program on iOS and said that the service would not be arriving on <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/08/05/microsoft-ends-ios-xcloud-testing-as-it-plans-to-launch-service-as-android-exclusive">iPhone and iPad</a>. In a statement on Thursday, Apple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/08/06/apple-explains-why-microsoft-xcloud-wont-be-coming-to-the-iphone">explained</a> that it bars apps which rely on cloud streaming, per its <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/app-store">App Store</a> guidelines. </p>
<p>Microsoft shot back at the Cupertino tech giant later on Thursday, issuing a <a href="https://twitter.com/iansherr/status/1291531485275656193">statement</a> to CNET that accused Apple of treating gaming apps unfairly compared to other apps on its app marketplace. </p>
<p>"Apple stands alone as the only general purpose platform to deny 
customers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox 
Game Pass," a Microsoft spokesperson said. "And, it consistently treats 
gaming apps differently, applying more lenient rules to non-gaming apps 
even when they include interactive content." </p>
<p>Microsoft admitted that it doesn't currently have a path to bring its
 gaming service to the App Store. However, it also said that "we are 
committed to finding a path to bring cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass 
Ultimate to the iOS platform." </p>
<p>"We believe that the customer should be at the heart of the gaming 
experience, and gamers tell us they want to play, connect, and share 
anywhere, no matter where they are," Microsoft added. </p>
<p class="">The specific rule in Apple's App Store <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">guidelines</a>
 that prohibits gaming apps from offering a catalog of games streamed 
from the cloud is guideline 3.1.2(a), which says that "each game must be
 downloaded directly from the App Store." </p>
<p class="">Apple's own <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>
 is subject to the same rules. Instead of streaming the catalog from 
Apple servers, users must individually download each Apple Arcade game 
directly to their device before playing them. </p>
<p class="">As AppleInsider <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/03/25/app-store-guidelines-limit-what-gaming-services-players-can-access">reported</a>
 in March 2020, gaming services also can't offer any third-party games —
 which would limit the number of titles available on platforms like 
Google Stadia or Microsoft xCloud. </p>

<p class="rm-manual">I agree with Microsoft on this, but Apple (if they

<p class="rm-manual"> When you have 1.7 million apps on your platform, 
you don't get the pleasure or the privilege of saying you're not a 
general purpose platform. If they did, that would be a BS argument. MS 
is the only competitor that has the size and economic clout to go after 
Apple on this and I'm glad that they're raising the issue regarding 
Apple's dogmatic handling of the App Store.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> Apple is on point here. If you want to play on our
 platform play by our rules. I may be wrong, but I’m sure Microsoft is 
not letting Sony games stream to Xbox. Microsoft can’t be trusted. Why 
would they undermine their own development platform? If game developers 
were wooed to this and stopped developing for iOS directly, it would 
make us dependent on Microsoft like we were for the first Macintosh. 
Then when Microsoft looses interest like the tend to do, the platform 
would suffer. </p>

<p class="rm-manual"> Exactly. Microsoft is being a hypocrite when one 
realizes Microsoft is (arguably) even more stringent about the Xbox Live
 store. </p>

<p class="rm-manual"> Apple isn't on point. It is their platform and 
their rules, but that doesn't make them on point. Yes you are wrong. 
Microsoft has nothing to do with Sony games not streaming on XBox. Sony 
ain't letting their exclusive IP play on XBoxes. If Sony would let it 
happen, MS would sacrifice virgins to be able to have games like 
Uncharted, God of War, or the Last of US on their console. That's not to
 say they won't play nice in the future since the groundwork is already 
being laid. <a rel="nofollow ugc" href="https://news.microsoft.com/2019/05/16/sony-and-microsoft-to-explore-strategic-partnership/">https://news.microsoft.com/2019/05/16/sony-and-microsoft-to-explore-strategic-partnership/</a> But make no mistake, that ball is firmly in Sony's court to play. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Your dev theory makes no sense at all. Any dev 
wanting to code on either platform can do so now, without restriction. 
iOS and XCloud gaming is fundamentally different and targeted at 
completely different play styles. No disrespect to iOS devs, but why 
would MS want to woo them? It's not like they have any AAA game 
development experience. They have experience primarily in mobile game 
development. That's not what XCloud is about. It's about bring the AAA 
experience to any and every device possible. They're trying to bring Red
 Dead Redemption 2 and it's gargantuan 100+GB file size to iPads.</p>
