<p>By the time he was 17, Charles Ryu had escaped <a href="http://aplus.com/a/north-korea-give-up-nuclear-weapons-south-korea-moon-jae-in">North Korea</a>
 not once but twice. Now, he's working with a California-based 
organization to help other North Korean refugees make their own journeys
 to freedom through a series of clandestine, underground networks. </p>
<p>The organization, called <a href="https://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/">Liberty in North Korea</a>
 (LiNK), was started by a group of Korean-American students at Yale in 
2006. Since then, it has evolved into a wide-reaching program that is 
both aiding North Koreans who want to escape the oppressive regime and 
changing the narrative about what life for North Koreans is really like.
 </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span> Recommended </span> </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="file:///"> More Videos </a> </p>
<p>"The media tends to focus on the regime, Kim Jong-un and nuclear 
weapons," Ian McKay, the marketing and communications coordinator for 
LiNK, told A Plus. "And those are serious issues that deserve to be 
highlighted…But that's what the regime wants. They know how to respond 
to that. What gets tricky for the regime is when the focus is on the 
human rights abuses of the North Korean people."</p>
<p>Ryu's story is a good illustration of those abuses. </p>
<p>Now an advocacy intern with LiNK, Ryu was born in <a href="http://aplus.com/a/north-korea-map-south-korea-missile-diplomacy?no_monetization=true">North Korea.</a>
 According to Ryu, his father, left him when he was a young child, his 
mother died of starvation when he was 11, and as a teenager, he lived 
with an aunt and uncle who loathed him because he ate their limited 
food. That's when he finally cracked and decided he wanted to escape the
 country.</p>
<p>"The true motivation for trying to escape is usually hunger," Ryu told A Plus. </p>
<p> <span>Charles Ryu poses for a picture wearing a LiNK t-shirt.</span> <span>Liberty In North Korea</span> </p>
<p>After Ryu wrote to his father, then living in China, Ryu's 
stepbrother, who is Chinese, used a coveted passport to enter North 
Korea alone and leave with Ryu in tow. The trio reunited in China, where
 Ryu's new surroundings were intoxicating. He no longer had to beg for 
food or sleep outside, and he felt safe in his new home knowing that his
 father was Chinese. </p>
<p>He was 14 years old and experiencing life outside of North Korea for 
the first time. But he didn't know that the hardest part was yet to 
come. He never imagined he'd be sent back to North Korea.</p>
<p>Ryu told A Plus that a Chinese citizen reported him to the 
government, though he never figured out whether he was friends with the 
person who turned him in. He heard later that the reward for reporting 
him was 800 yuan — about $126. </p>
<p>In a "friendship treaty" that was signed between North Korea and 
China in 1961, Chinese government officials and North Korea's government
 agreed to cooperate with each other on a number of social, economic and
 military issues. Today, the treaty is often cited as motivation for the
 Chinese government to send any North Koreans they find in China back 
home. The government in China refuses to recognize North Korean refugees
 as anything but illegal immigrants. The U.N., in contrast, classifies 
them as asylum seekers or political refugees. </p>
<p>The agreement protects China from a massive influx of immigrants, and
 repatriates many refugees to North Korea, where they are summarily 
punished.</p>
<p>Ryu was sent to a labor camp, a dreaded outcome for North Korean 
refugees who manage to escape the regime. Some experts estimate that 
there are as many as 120,000 North Koreans in similar political labor 
camps. Ryu says he was fed 50 kernels of corn three times a day while 
doing 12 hours of hard labor. He nearly died of starvation, he said. 
Once again, he felt the desperate desire to leave, but now he had an 
added motivation: he knew what the outside world was like. </p>

their families who are still in North Korea.</span> <span>Liberty In North Korea</span> </p>
<p>"For me, because I already had experience in China and had already tasted it, I could not really give up on that," Ryu said.</p>
<p>Pushed to the edge of death, Ryu was released from the labor camp 
with his punishment complete. He said it took half a year to recover, 
and by then his family had completely abandoned him. But he was grateful
 to get out of the camp.</p>
<p>"Some people are actually born in there and never get out," he said. 
"I couldn't stand the lies that [the] North Korea government told me 
when I was repatriated back to North Korea. In the labor camp, hard 
manual labor made me realize what I was capable of, that I am strong and
 not going to die, I will survive no matter what."</p>
<p>In May of 2011, he decided he would try to escape again. Ryu had been
 working in coal mines, a job he came to appreciate because he was fed 
well and paid in rice. But he couldn't shake his memories of the outside
 world, and when a train broke down outside the mine where he worked, he
 didn't hesitate to board it. Ryu tried to fit in with other passengers 
and became elated when he found out that it was headed to a border town 
near China. In the middle of the ride, though, he was asked for his 
tickets and paperwork and could not produce them. Train security locked 
him in a holding area but, again, Ryu managed to escape. </p>
<p>This time he went through a window, and managed to reach the border 
of China by hopping trains, swimming across rivers and hiking barefoot —
 sometimes days at a time — until he collapsed on a highway in Chinese 
territory. A Chinese man took him in and introduced him to a South 
Korean pastor who said he'd try to help him get to South Korea safely.</p>
<p> <span>The route many North Koreans take to be resettled in South Korea.</span> <span>Liberty In North Korea</span> </p>
<p>Because Ryu's father was Chinese, South Korea would not resettle him 
as a North Korean refugee. Instead, he was granted political asylum in 
the United States, where he lives today. Ryu's second escape was a 
daring journey he took mostly on his own, but now he's helping others 
inside <a href="http://aplus.com/a/north-korea-yeonmi-park-one-young-world?no_monetization=true">North Korea </a>find their way out. </p>
<p>McKay says LiNK has built a network of partners on the ground, none 
of whom are associated with any government entities. They run special 
rescue routes through China to South Korea, and have established groups 
of people they can trust to help them move refugees discreetly through 
North Korea, China and Southeast Asia to get to asylum in countries like
 South Korea or the United States. LiNK claims to have a 95 percent 
escape success rate, which McKay described as "above the industry 
standard" of 70 percent for organizations that do similar work.</p>
<p>LiNK has rescued 756 refugees since it began helping North Koreans 
escape, and it polls each of them on their reasons for trying to leave 
the country. Often times, McKay said, the outside influence refugees 
came in contact with could be as basic as South Korean or American 
television dramas. In those shows, they would see regular people driving
 nice cars or eating white rice, and wonder why they weren't afforded 
the same luxuries. </p>
<p>"One of the biggest poll factors for North Koreans leaving the 
country is they have been exposed to the outside world," McKay said. 
"For last 10 years, the regime has said it wanted to control the info. 
They did a pretty good job at for a long time. But now there is so much 
dissemination of outside info coming into the country… and it's creating
 awareness of the outside world."</p>
<p> <span>A collage of North Koreans that LiNK has helped escape. </span> <span>Liberty In North Korea</span> </p>
<p>In the last year, though, those rescues have been happening less 
often. McKay says just 1,200 North Korean refugees safely resettled in 
South Korea in 2017, a significant drop from years prior. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/03/china-redoubling-crackdowns-fleeing-north-koreans">Human Rights Watch has also documented</a>
 an increase in the number of North Korean refugees that China is 
detaining and sending back home. Chinese officials have cracked down on 
routes used by LiNK and similar organizations to help North Koreans 
escape, and the North Korean regime has increased security on border 
areas like the one Ryu crossed to safety. In part, the regime is 
responding to the growing amount of outside information that is 
spreading throughout the country and leading people to try and make an 
escape.</p>
<p>"When they [refugees] leave or when their parents leave, then North 
Korean refugees are calling their friends and family still inside the 
country and telling them, 'I made it out, I'm safe, and guess what? The 
world outside North Korea is so much better,'" McKay said. "Every time 
we help the North Korean refugees and resettle them, they are sending 
money and information back into the country, which is just accelerating 
more change and putting pressure on the regime to adapt."</p>
<p>Now McKay, Ryu and the LiNK team are focused on changing the 
narrative about North Korea as they help refugees escape. For a long 
time, LiNK tried to change policy in Washington D.C. — but they realized
 their effort would be better spent educating Americans about North 
Korea and helping liberate the North Korean people directly. Both Ryu 
and McKay said the best thing Americans can do to help is to donate to 
organizations like LiNK. A group of "Vision Donors" supports LiNK's 
operations budget, but 100 percent of any outside donations goes 
directly to the refugee rescue program, its "Changing the Narrative" 
work, and a refugee empowerment program for North Koreans who have been 
resettled. </p>
<p>McKay compared what's happening in North Korea to the <a href="http://aplus.com/a/unhcr-refugee-statistics-countries-syria-crisis-united-nations?no_monetization=true">crisis in Syria</a>,
 pointing out that Americans often recognize the Syrian people as being 
separate from the Syrian government, but struggle to show the same 
empathy for North Korean citizens living under the North Korean regime. 
Ryu agreed.</p>
<p>"I want people to know that North Korean people are normal," Ryu 
said. "They have dreams and they want better life as we all do."</p>
<p>With tensions high between North Korea and the U.S., despite the 
historic potential of an in-person meeting between the two countries' 
leaders, his emphasis on the humanity of his former countrymen may be 
more important now than ever.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: A previous version of this story noted Charles Ryu was 
imprisoned in a "political labor camp." He was held in a labor camp.</p>
