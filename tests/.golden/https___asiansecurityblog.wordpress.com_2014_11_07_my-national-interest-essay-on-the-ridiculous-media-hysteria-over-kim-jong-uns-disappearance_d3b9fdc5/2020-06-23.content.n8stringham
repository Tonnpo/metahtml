<p>Admit it, you miss the wild speculation about Kim Jong Un’s 
disappearance last month. It was lunatic fun, right? Was he dead? Was 
his sister in charge? WAS HE REPLACED BY ALIENS?!! Run for the hills! </p>
<p>To me, in retrospect, the big story was not KJU’s disappearance, but 
the wild, almost lunatic conspiracy-theorizing it unleashed in the West.
 </p>
<p>North Korea is a running punch-line in the West. Kim Jong Il was the 
villain in Team America. The story that the Norks found a unicorn a few 
years ago got play for weeks in the US for its sheer laugh value. So 
this essay was an effort to get a handle on this – why do Western media 
feel license to make any wild, preposterous claim they want about North 
Korea? Where does this bizarre obsession come from? There’s probably a 
good MA thesis in here actually if you were serious about it. </p>
<p>The following essay was first published by the <a href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/10/30/What-did-we-learn-from-all-the-Kim-Jong-Un-has-dissappeared-hysteria.aspx?COLLCC=2212766809&amp;">Lowy Institute</a>, and then <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/north-korea-the-mafia-lessons-the-kim-jong-un-has-11584">picked up by The National Interest</a>. This was the first time I was published by TNI, so that was pretty cool. My thanks to the TNI editor, my friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/GrecianFormula">Harry Kazianis</a>. </p>
<p>“For six weeks, from September 3 to October 14, Kim Jong Un, the 
leader of North Korea disappeared from view. The rumors it triggered 
became increasingly outlandish – he was dead or dying; body doubles were
 being prepared (a <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/12/21/was-kim-jong-il-murdered-in-power-struggle-with-north-koreas-military/">favorite theory</a>
 about his father); his sister was running (a female leader in North 
Korea – seriously?); factional infighting had broken out in the 
backrooms of Pyongyang; he had been pushed aside in a coup. As if to 
illustrate just how untethered the commentary had become, <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/where-is-kim-jongun,37147/">the Onion</a> ran its own pretty funny mock story. </p>
<p>Now that the Young General is back, the <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/10/15-kim-jong-un-disappearing-reappearing-act-pollack">hangover has kicked-in</a>.
 Increasingly the noteworthy story is of the last two months is not Kim 
Jong Un’s disappearance itself, but the explosion of increasingly 
over-the-top media speculation it unleashed in the West particularly. In
 South Korea (where I live) the media coverage was obviously sustained, 
but not nearly as unhinged. I think we can draw a few conclusions from 
the <a href="https://twitter.com/Robert_E_Kelly/status/521447868154933248">speculative fun we all had</a> last month: </p>
<p>1. The Kims get sick too, but the regime can stumble on for awhile. </p>
<p>This seems pretty banal – no, it is pretty banal – but everyone 
seemed to forget that Kim Jong Un’s father Kim Jong Il suffered from a 
stroke and disappeared from view for twice as long back in 2008. At that
 time too, there was some hysteria, but nothing like this time around, 
even though it was longer. I am not sure why. </p>
<p>It is worth noting that the Kims, obviously, lead pretty unhealthy 
lives. All three Kim monarchs were seriously overweight, if not obese, 
in their prime. All were rumored to be very heavy drinkers and smokers, 
possibly abusing narcotics. Kim <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kim+jong+il+alcohol&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-US:IE-Address&amp;ie=&amp;oe=&amp;gws_rd=ssl#rls=com.microsoft:en-US:IE-Address&amp;q=kim+jong+il+hennessy">Jong Il’s consumption of Hennessey</a> was legend. North Korea even has a semi-formal prostitution service – the ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippumjo">joy brigade</a>’
 – for its elites, presumably including the top leader. The Kims are the
 modern versions of the self-indulgent tyrants of antiquity, like Nero, 
living a lifestyle of gross over-indulgence. Not surprisingly, they have
 recurrent health issues. </p>
<p>But this does not mean that the state falls apart immediately. 
Presumably even North Korea, focused as it is on the ‘Sun-King,’ can 
muddle through on autopilot for at least a few months, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC0IJpAbJA4&amp;index=44&amp;list=PLaLCR_fe1FTuJZE4H61P373QmzqJTatN6">prediction I made</a>
 before Kim Jong Un resurfaced this month. The Kims are the focus of 
global media attention, but there is a whole cluster of family, of 
retainers, flunkeys, high-ranking KPA (Korean People’s Army) and KWP 
(Korean Worker’s Party) officials deeply vested in the continuation of 
the Kim monarchy. If these figures did not turn on each other in a 
factional power-struggle after Kim Jong Il unexpectedly died in 2011 
(which many of us expected), it was hard to see them doing so in these 
circumstances. </p>
<p>I’ve often thought a good analogy for North Korea is <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2011/12/19/kim-jong-il-the-don-corleone-of-north-korea-has-died/">the mafia</a>.
 North Korea engages in all sorts of illicit activities, from its 
well-known proliferation efforts to its less well-known meth operations 
and insurance fraud. The DPRK is what happens when the godfather and his
 cronies manage to take over a whole country; the Kims are the Korean 
version of the Corleones. In such a structure, all the top players are 
bound to each other by blood, shared knowledge of each other’s 
criminality, and desire to keep the lifestyle and money rolling in. In 
the same way the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yY-Glhs8ns">Corleone family survived the don’s near assassination</a>
 and semi-retirement, so will the Kim gangster-ocracy. No one (in either
 family) wants the structure to fall apart, because they are all 
complicit in its awfulness and enjoying its rewards, so the incentives 
are huge to put the system on autopilot when el hefe is temporarily 
incapacitated. </p>
<p>2. The Media Over-focus on the Kims </p>
<p>Part of the problem must be the unique global media focus on the Kims, specifically the leader. In my experience <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaLCR_fe1FTuJZE4H61P373QmzqJTatN6">with media as a commenter/talking head</a>,
 I am routinely asked about the Kims themselves – their personal habits,
 their mental state, their absurdities (Kim Jong Il’s platform shoes and
 bouffant hair-style were favorites). The working assumption is often 
that they’re just <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0tWoguayXM&amp;index=10&amp;list=PLaLCR_fe1FTuJZE4H61P373QmzqJTatN6">‘bonkers,’ as a Sky TV reporter</a> asked me once. </p>
<p>But clearly no country with a large population can function without 
some manner of institutions tying the society together. And North Korea,
 in its own unique, gangster-ish way, has those. The most important are 
the army and the party (probably – we don’t really know), soldered 
together by the personal relationships of the extended Kim clan. It is a
 curiously feudal or patrimonial structure, <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2010/10/16/on-the-kim-family-succession-in-north-korea/">especially for a state that, in its ideology, formally condemns feudalism as backward and reactionary</a>.
 It is not ‘weberian’ or rational. It is massively economically 
dysfunctional; it led, for example, to the famine of the 1990s. For this
 reason political scientists often define the DPRK as fragile or 
brittle; it is regularly near the top of the Fund for Peace’ annual <a href="http://ffp.statesindex.org/">Failed State Index</a>. </p>
<p>But North Korea has managed to survive far greater challenges and 
hurdles than many of us would have thought it could have overcome if 
asked, say, twenty or twenty-five years. Despite the death of Kim Il 
Sung, the cut-off of Soviet subsidies, the famines, the extreme 
isolation following the nuclear tests, the sudden death of Kim Jong Il, 
and Kim Jong Un’s disturbing desire to party with Dennis Rodman, the 
regime lurches on. Clearly there is much more going on that just a 
sun-king monarchy, however relentless the <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2013/04/13/the-awful-state-of-us-punditry-on-the-north-korea-crisis-bill-richardson-called-kim-il-sung-kim-yun-sum-or-something-like-that-on-cnn-yesterday/">media focus on the top leadership</a>. </p>
<p>3. The Media enjoys the sheer Lunacy and Freedom to wildly speculate that North Korea opens up </p>
<p>Perhaps I watch too much media coverage of North Korea, but I am 
always struck by how ‘unplugged’ North Korea allows otherwise bland 
media networks and reporters to be. A year ago, wild unsubstantiated 
rumors circulated that Kim Jong Un’s uncle (Jang Song-Thaek) had been 
executed by <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/kim-jong-uns-uncle-was-shot-not-fed-to-a-pack-of-wild-dogs-2014-1">wild dogs tearing him apart</a>.
 This ‘story’ originated in some obscure Chinese paper but was quickly 
picked up by western media with little fact-checking. Almost certainly, 
the sheer luridness of it was appealing: North Korea is a black-hole; 
the boy-king is probably bonkers anyway; sure, why not run that story. </p>
<p>Similar media hype of <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/13/communist-kitsch-update-north-korean-traffic-cops-gone-wild/">North Korean kitschy ridiculousness</a> can seen in the stories about its <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/30/unicorn-lair-discovered-north-korea">discovery of a unicorn</a>.
 Once again, the story went viral (google it and see), probably for the 
sheer lunatic fun of reporting on North Korea. It’s almost like you can 
say anything. That must be fun in a way. Consider all those ‘Kim looking
 at things’ tumblrs (best one <a href="http://kimjongillookingatthings.tumblr.com/">here</a>). At some point, this is almost not really news anymore. It’s comedy. But they are actually really serious <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/is-it-moral-to-find-humor-in-north-koreas-bizarreness/">ethical issues about laughing</a>
 over North Korea, a place where hundreds of thousands are executed or 
imprisoned in appalling conditions. Remember that next time you hear 
some gratuitously parodic depiction of North Korea.</p>

 think the reason for the intense speculation is no one believes that 
Kim Jong Un has the same grip on power as his father had, people are 
waiting for some blow back from the purges, and generally everyone is 
hoping he’ll hurry up and die because – in human rights terms – nothing 
has improved under his reign.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I think some 
satire and humor is allowable and even a strong weapon, especially if 
North Koreans (say in China) could ever get online and see it, or it 
could be smuggled into the country. Treating the “image” of the state 
overly seriously would accord it the international respect it craves. 
Internationally the regime wants to appear stately and threatening.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I agree, though, the tabloid style interest in KJU as just another reality show celebrity is ethically more depressing.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/my-national-interest-essay-on-the-ridiculous-media-hysteria-over-kim-jong-uns-disappearance/?replytocom=25329#respond">Reply <span>↓</span></a> </p> </article> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>keneckert</span> on <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/my-national-interest-essay-on-the-ridiculous-media-hysteria-over-kim-jong-uns-disappearance/#comment-25395">November 11, 2014 at 10:14 pm</a> <span>said:</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual">If I can plug my own posting on this from over a year ago: <a href="http://keneckert.com/academic/essays/north-korea.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://keneckert.com/academic/essays/north-korea.html</a></p> <p class="rm-manual">To
 summarize the argument I made, does it not seem odd to anyone that 
North Korea is so prickly about its “dignity,” but mostly says little 
about media depictions of itself as wacky, zany, and unhinged? My theory
 is that it tacitly encourages a western portrayal as barmy or insane, 
in order to distract from its own actions and to posture for aid and 
loot. Pretending to be crazy brings attention and fear whenever it 
completes another nuclear test or carries out some bizarre, inexplicable
 display of power. This swagger of being a rebel plays well domestically
 and keeps international observers nervous.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/my-national-interest-essay-on-the-ridiculous-media-hysteria-over-kim-jong-uns-disappearance/?replytocom=25395#respond">Reply <span>↓</span></a> </p> </article> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>Anonymous</span> on <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/my-national-interest-essay-on-the-ridiculous-media-hysteria-over-kim-jong-uns-disappearance/#comment-25411">November 12, 2014 at 1:37 pm</a> <span>said:</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual">From
 my non-academic point of view, western hysteria about Kim Jeongun’s 
disappearance is due to the opaqueness of the North Korean situation 
itself. In a world connected with instant news coverage, North Korea is a
 unique realm shrouded with ancient mysteries and barbarism. Western 
Media have always been intrigued about their pre-modern brutality and 
atrocity commited by their ancestors which are still being perpetrated 
by non-western people. Kim Jeongun is an archytipical figure in this 
regard. Any hint of his action or whereabout leaked from North Korea has
 to be a piece of meat thrown into a pack of wolves.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/my-national-interest-essay-on-the-ridiculous-media-hysteria-over-kim-jong-uns-disappearance/?replytocom=25411#respond">Reply <span>↓</span></a> </p> </article> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>keneckert</span> on <a href="https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/my-national-interest-essay-on-the-ridiculous-media-hysteria-over-kim-jong-uns-disappearance/#comment-25617">November 26, 2014 at 4:00 pm</a> <span>said:</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual">Robert,</p><p class="rm-manual">
 This isn’t totally germane to the thread, but I’m interested in your 
view on this, and maybe it’s the foundation for a future column– what do
 you make of the NK rally yesterday to denounce the UN court decision? I
 find it very odd. </p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">I 
know the regime tries to benefit from an 
us-against-the-entire-subhuman-world sentiment, but it seems to me that 
by trying to assert “231 countries are wrong about our forced-labor 
camps, which by the way don’t exist” they invite uncomfortable 
speculation among citizens. There’s a literary technique called 
disnarration (“Gentlemen, they say my honorable opposition is a 
horse-stealing whiskey-drinker, but let us take the high road; not a 
word of it shall pass my lips.”), which obviously calls attention to 
what ISN’T said, but for NK themselves to pregnantly express outrage at 
what they supposedly didn’t do feels odd–why not just suppress any news 
or reporting of this within the country?

 Your point is actually a good one. Why draw attention to it? Maybe
