<h1 class="rm-manual"> Murder charge dropped in Kim Jong Nam assassination </h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> Vietnamese suspect is given a lesser charge of 
causing harm and will soon walk free, a verdict that leaves the nerve 
agent killing of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's half brother unsolved

held in connection with the February 2017 assassination of North Korean 
leader Kim Jong Un’s half-brother Kim Jong Nam, is expected to walk free
 after pleading guilty to a lesser charge than murder in a Malaysian 
court.</p>
<p>A Malaysian judge today sentenced the 30-year-old Vietnamese national
 to three years and four months in jail for causing harm using dangerous
 means rather than murder, which under local law carries the death 
penalty by hanging.</p>
<p>Her legal team said that with usual sentence reductions for good 
behavior she would be released by “the first week” of May. Huong said 
she welcomed the “fair sentence” after the verdict was handed down in a 
case that involved the use of the lethal nerve agent VX.</p>
<p>Prosecutors offered the reduced charge after receiving representations from the Vietnamese embassy and the woman’s lawyers.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry reportedly stepped up lobbying 
efforts in recent weeks after prosecutors withdrew a similar murder 
charge against a second defendant, Indonesian national Siti Aisyah, last
 month.</p>
<p>Le Thi Thu Hang, a foreign ministry spokesperson, was quoted in 
Vietnamese media saying that officials from Hanoi have been in regular 
contact with Malaysian authorities “at the highest level to ensure a 
fair trial and freedom for Doan Thi Huong.”</p>
<p>Aisyah’s release on March 11 was largely attributed to a sustained 
high-level lobbying campaign by the Indonesian government, which 
included a personal appeal from President Joko Widodo to Malaysia’s 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.</p>
<p>The Indonesian embassy flew the 27-year-old to Jakarta on the same day that she was released.</p>

High Court, outside Kuala Lumpur, on March 11, 2019, after being 
acquitted of killing Kim Jong Nam. Photo: AFP/Mohd Rasfan</figcaption><p>Prosecutors
 sprung a surprise decision to drop the murder charge against Aisyah but
 later declined to do the same for Doan, who was seen sobbing and 
shaking violently in the dock when her appeal was rejected three days 
after her co-defendant walked free.</p>
<p>Vietnamese Ambassador to Malaysia Le Quy Quynh at the time expressed 
disappointment over the decision, saying Hanoi would push for her 
release “as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Pham Binh Minh, Vietnam’s foreign minister, had even called his 
Malaysian counterpart with an unprecedented public request for her 
release.</p>
<p>Hanoi does not ordinarily get involved in overseas criminal cases 
involving its citizens, though Huong’s case had been followed closely by
 the country’s senior leaders and citizens.</p>
<p>Analysts previously said that Malaysia risked creating a rift with 
Hanoi if their citizen was not afforded similar treatment to that given 
to her Indonesian co-defendant.</p>
<p>So far no other suspects apart from the two women have faced charges for the high-profile killing.</p>

 women maintain their innocence and say they were duped by North Korean 
agents into believing they were participating in a prank for a hidden 
camera TV show that saw them smearing lotion on the faces of strangers 
in exchange for cash.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Nam was assassinated at the Kuala Lumpur International airport before he was due to board a flight to Macau.</p>
<p>Police quickly apprehended both women shortly after closed-circuit 
television cameras showed them accosting the 45-year-old North Korean in
 the airport terminal.</p>
<p>Security footage appears to show the women smearing his face with a 
substance investigators believed to be the toxic nerve agent VX.</p>
<p>The use of a banned chemical substance classified by the United 
Nations as a weapon of mass destruction immediately raised questions of 
state complicity. US officials and South Korean intelligence regard the 
killing as a political assassination orchestrated by North Korean 
operatives, an accusation that Pyongyang adamantly denies.</p>
<p>Four North Korean men who boarded flights out of Kuala Lumpur on the 
morning of the incident are still wanted over the murder and remain at 
large. It is unlikely that North Korea would ever repatriate the 
individuals who are believed to have supplied the banned chemical used 
in the killing to Malaysia to face trial.</p>
<figcaption>Kim Jong Nam (L) had spoken out publicly against his 
family’s dynastic control of the isolated, nuclear-armed nation and Kim 
Jong Un had reportedly issued a ‘standing order’ for his half-brother’s 
assassination in 2012. Photo: AFP</figcaption><p>The two women are 
widely viewed as scapegoats for a North Korean state-sponsored crime. 
Other North Korean citizens of interest and diplomatic staff were 
permitted to exit Malaysia in a subsequent deal with Pyongyang to ease a
 tense diplomatic row that had flared between the two countries over the
 incident.</p>
<p>North Korea had then accused Malaysia, one of its few diplomatic 
partners, of working with Seoul and other “hostile forces.” Both 
countries recalled their ambassadors and barred diplomats from leaving 
during the short-lived spat.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Nam’s body was returned to Pyongyang after an autopsy was concluded as per the deal.</p>
<p>Defense lawyers for the women at the time said Malaysian authorities 
had compromised the proceedings by allowing the North Korean suspects to
 flee the country, who travelled on a circuitous journey through 
Jakarta, Dubai and Russia before returning to Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Video recordings show the women accompanied by the four men before the poisoning took place.</p>
<p>The incident brought North Korea’s relations with members of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) into harsh new focus, 
prompting scrutiny of a stance some diplomats had viewed as too 
permissive and accommodating. That openness is said to have enabled 
Pyongyang to entrench its espionage and commercial networks across the 
region.</p>

embassy in Kuala Lumpur following the murder of Kim Jong Nam in February
 2017. Photo: Reuters/Athit Perawongmetha</figcaption><p>North Korea has
 never acknowledged the deceased – who traveled on a diplomatic passport
 under the name “Kim Chol” – as the half-brother of supreme leader Kim 
Jong Un, or as the eldest son of late leader Kim Jong Il.</p>
<p>North Korean officials have only referred to Kim Jong Nam as “a citizen of the DPRK” and blamed his death on a heart attack.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Nam, who was once considered heir apparent to the North 
Korean leadership before falling out of favor, had been based in Macau 
since the early 2000s and kept a very low profile.</p>
<p>He was, however, publicly critical of his younger half-brother’s 
ascension to North Korea’s leadership and enjoyed well-established ties 
with the Chinese government, according to US intelligence reports.</p>
<p>Analysts believe his killing may have been motivated by the belief 
that a foreign government could utilize him to replace his half-brother –
 whom he apparently never met – as a political figurehead who shares the
 Kim family bloodline.</p>
<p>The incident, however, has since largely faded from public view as 
North Korea’s push for wider diplomatic normalization, witnessed in Kim 
Jong Un’s recent summit meetings with US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p class="">Malaysia has never outright accused North Korea of 
complicity in the killing. Tensions have since appeared to ease, with 
Mahathir saying last year that Kuala Lumpur would reopen its embassy in 
Pyongyang, which has reportedly not been staffed since April 2017.</p>
