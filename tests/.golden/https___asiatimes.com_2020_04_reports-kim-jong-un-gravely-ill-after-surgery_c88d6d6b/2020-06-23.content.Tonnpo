<p> 'Cardiovascular surgery performed April 12' on the obese scion of a ruling clan with bad health genes </p>

The network quotes “a US official with direct knowledge.”</p>
<p>There has been no official confirmation of that prognosis. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-21/kim-surgery-report-fuels-speculation-about-north-korean-leader">Bloomberg News </a>in
 its follow-up quoted unnamed US officials as saying the White House had
 been told Kim took a turn for the worse after surgery last week and his
 condition had become critical. But the Bloomberg report emphasized that
 the US administration was not certain about the current condition of 
Kim.</p>
<p>Both the CNN and Bloomberg dispatches followed <a href="https://www.dailynk.com/english/source-kim-jong-un-recently-received-heart-surgery/">a report by Daily NK</a>,
 a Seoul-based news service partially staffed by defectors and with 
contacts inside North Korea, quoting one such source as saying Kim 
underwent “urgent” cardiovascular surgery April 12 at a hospital near 
one of his many villas. </p>
<p>“Excessive smoking, obesity, and fatigue were the direct causes of 
Kim’s urgent cardiovascular treatment,” Daily NK cited the unidentified 
source as saying.</p>
<p>He was “recuperating” with doctors in attendance at his Hyangsan 
villa, in the Mount Myohyang area north of Pyongyang, Daily NK added.</p>
<p>The source “suggested” that the surgery took place at Hyangsan 
Hospital, which Daily NK said is reserved for members of the Kim family.</p>
<p>“A doctor from the Kim Man Yoo Hospital in Pyongyang reportedly 
managed Kim’s heart operation along with other doctors with the Korean 
Red Cross General Hospital and the Pyongyang Medical University who 
typically handle medical issues concerning the North Korean leader,” 
Daily NK said.</p>
<p>Tending to call into question the US media reports, Daily NK added: 
“Most of the doctors reportedly returned to Pyongyang after Kim’s 
condition was considered stable following the surgery. Only some of the 
doctors have remained near Kim to monitor his health, the Daily NK 
source said.”</p>
<p>Of course Kim’s condition could have changed after some docttors had 
returned to Pyongyang and/or after the Daily NK source reported, and 
that new development could have come to the attention of US 
intelligence.</p>
<p>In addition to the doctors still attending him, Daily NK said, 
“around 30 members of Kim’s personal guard along with other guard units 
are reportedly watching over Hyang San Villa. Guards who were at the 
villa before Kim arrived have reportedly been stationed elsewhere for 
the time being.”</p>
<h4>Skeptical responses</h4>
<p>A spokesman for South Korea’s presidential Blue House said in an 
early statement: “We have nothing to confirm and no special movement has
 been detected inside North Korea as of now.” </p>
<p>Later on Tuesday, the Blue House said, in a text message sent to 
foreign reporters, that Kim was “with his aides” and was “carrying out 
normal duties.” However, the Blue House did not mention Kim’s state of 
health, nor the source of their information.</p>
<p>The South’s unification ministry – which handles inter-Korean 
relations – and the defense ministry declined to comment and Moon 
Chung-in, the security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, 
told AFP that he had not heard anything on Kim’s health.</p>
<p>Thae Yong Ho, a former senior North Korean diplomat who last week 
became the first defector ever to be directly elected to the South’s 
parliament, was skeptical about the reports. </p>
<p>“The movements and personal affairs of the Kim family are national 
top secret issues which are little known to not only ordinary people but
 also high-ranking officials,” he said in a statement. </p>
<p>Thae recalled that Kim’s father Kim Jong Il died on December 17, 
2011, but even two days later it was still business as usual at the 
North’s foreign ministry. “Everyone was caught by surprise” when the 
announcement was made, he said.</p>
<h4>Speculation rife</h4>
<p>Kim had last been seen publicly as he presided over a meeting of the Political Bureau of the ruling Workers’ Party on April 11.</p>
<p>His subsequent absence from April 15 rites celebrating the 108th 
birthday of his grandfather, the country’s first president, Kim Il Sung,
 had <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2020/04/where-art-thou-supreme-leader-kim-five-theories/">aroused intense speculation</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding that, Daily NK had reported: “‘On Monday night [April 13] ,
 the authorities suddenly announced that many of the events celebrating 
Kim Il Sung’s birthday have been canceled,’ a Ryanggang Province-based 
source told Daily NK on April 14. Daily NK sources also reported that 
representatives from around the country were told to watch a rally held 
on the afternoon of April 14 on TV.”</p>
<p>On the 15th, Kim Il Sung’s actual birthday and North Korea’s most 
important holiday, “A skeleton crew was at hand for a flag-raising 
ceremony.” </p>
<p>Speculation on Jong Un’s health has been rife for years as he’s 
bloated himself up into a facsimile of his popularly revered 
grandfather, smoking all the while.</p>
<p>He was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-kim-north-korea-dominated-wheezing-dmz-tucker-carlson">audibly out of breath last June 30 when he met US President Donald Trump in the Demilitarized Zone</a>.
 Earlier, reporters who covered the first-ever summit between Kim and 
South Korean President Moon Jae-in in 2018 were surprised to hear heavy 
puffing from Kim being picked up on audio as he and Moon walked up a low
 flight of steps.</p>
<p>Anna Fifield, author of a <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2019/08/kims-the-most-machiavellian-figure-of-our-time/">biography of Kim</a>, describes him as five feet seven inches tall and weighing around 300 pounds, making his body mass index 45: “extremely obese.”</p>
<h4>Unhealthy Kims</h4>
<p>While the ruling Kim clan have access to the very best health care in
 North Korea – from “wizard’s pillow” herbal health packs to imported 
Western doctors who enter the country when the need arises – the family 
genes are not good.</p>
<p>“It is definitely not a healthy family,” <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2018/06/tracking-the-man-behind-the-myth-of-kim-jong-un/">Sebastian Falletti, author of the biography</a>
 La Piste Kim: Voyage au coeur de la Coree du Nord (On the trail of Kim:
 A voyage into the heart of North Korea), told Asia Times. “We know he 
probably has chronic hereditary issues.”</p>
<p>Grandfather Kim Il Sung suffered from a huge tumor on his back/neck – which photographers were not allowed to capture – and by <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312323226">some reports</a>
 died of apoplexy. The middle-generation ruler Kim Jong Il, father of 
Kim Jong Un, apparently suffered from diabetes and also suffered 
cardiovascular issues that resulted in his disappearance for several 
months. </p>
<p>“Two years before he died in December 2011, Kim Jong Il, in August 
2008, went through a cardiovascular incident and was in a coma for 
several weeks,” Falletti said. “You had this phase of total silence from
 North Korea. We had no clue what had happened. We learned the story 
afterward from a French doctor who went to North Korea to examine him.”</p>
<p>Moreover, in 2014, Kim Jong Un himself disappeared for several weeks 
in 2014, apparently due to foot or heel surgery, which raised the 
question of whether he was suffering from gout.</p>
<p>In the smoke-and-mirrors world of North Korea, one expert questioned the veracity of the nascent reports.</p>
<p>“These are major state secrets and if Daily NK can come up with that 
kind of information, then US intelligence might have picked up some 
chatter from North Korean communications networks,” Go Myong-hyun, a 
North Korea watcher at Seoul’s Asan Institute told Asia Times. “Or, 
their information could just be the Daily NK article.”</p>
<p>A National Security Agency listening station is, indeed, set inside a
 secure compound on Camp Humphrey’s the main US base in South Korea. And
 Falletti suggested that if a Western doctor had been brought into the 
country to oversee Kim’s health, that person could also be a source of 
intelligence.</p>
<h4>Succession possibility</h4>
<p>The risk of Kim falling ill with no successor in place has always existed.</p>
<p>“The geopolitical risk of the health of the leader is crucial it is 
such a pyramidical system, if the leader passes away the entire system 
is impacted; there is a risk of a vacuum,” Falletti said. “That is the 
Achilles heel of the North Korean system.”</p>
<p>However, in the event of a crisis, there is another Kim on hand – and
 one who is already in a position of some authority: Kim Yo Jong. </p>
<p>She had been restored on Saturday to an alternate membership in the 
Politburo, a post she had vacated after failure of diplomatic efforts 
she’d been involved in with the US Trump administration. Most Pyongyang 
watchers would consider her the regime’s logical choice as a dynastic 
successor.</p>
<p>“This is the theory of succession in North Korea,” said Choi 
Jin-wook, a former head of the Korea Institute of National Unification 
and currently a North Korea watcher at Seoul’s Hankook University of 
Foreign Studies. “Even though she is not a man, it would not be 
surprising if she took over the leadership.”</p>
