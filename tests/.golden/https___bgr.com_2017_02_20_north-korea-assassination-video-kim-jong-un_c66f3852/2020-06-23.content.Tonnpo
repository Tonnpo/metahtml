<h1 class="rm-manual">Insane video shows the moment Kim Jong Un’s brother was assassinated</h1>

<p class="rm-manual">February 20th, 2017 at 4:48 PM</p>
<p class="">Last week, Kim Jong Nam, better known as Kim Jong-un’s 
estranged half -brother, was attacked and poisoned with a mysterious 
substance at an airport in Malaysia. Earlier today, video of the 
incident obtained via security cameras was released to the public.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://bgr.com/2017/02/20/iphone-8-facial-recognition-realface/">Don't Miss<span>:</span> <span>This new iPhone 8 feature might end up blowing our minds</span></a></p>
<p>Per the video below, posted this afternoon on NBC News, we see Kim 
walking leisurely through the airport before a woman — believed to be a 
North Korean agent — accosts him from behind and wipes a cloth across 
his face before fleeing the scene. From start to finish, the entire 
attack was over in just five seconds.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Kim approached airport security to discuss what 
happened and to ask for assistance. Unfortunately, Kim ultimately passed
 away before he could even reach the hospital.</p>
<p>The video capturing the chain of events is rather harrowing.</p>
<p>Predictably, Kim’s murder has become an extremely volatile political and diplomatic incident.</p>
<p>“Malaysia has recalled its ambassador from Pyongyang for consultations,” <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/kim-jong-nam-murder-video-shows-moment-kim-jong-un-n723236" rel="nofollow">NBC News notes</a>, “and summoned the North Korean ambassador in the country to explain the allegations.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, North Korea is accusing Malaysia of working with South Korea in an effort to paint North Korea in a bad light.</p>
<p>“The investigation by the Malaysian police is not for the 
clarification of the cause of the death and search for the suspect,” a 
North Korean official said, “but it is out of the political aim.”</p>
<p>The motive behind the attack remains unclear, but reports indicate 
that Kimg Jong-un became aware of his half-brother’s intent to defect 
from North Korea and decided to take lethal action.</p>
<p>Since the video became public, four individuals believed to be 
involved in the attack have been apprehended. It’s also been suggested 
that the female attacker may have actually been a man in disguise.</p>
<p>As for the substance of the poison used in the attack, it’s believed 
that the cloth rubbed across Kim’s face may have been laced with “either
 ricin or deadly puffer fish toxins.”</p>
