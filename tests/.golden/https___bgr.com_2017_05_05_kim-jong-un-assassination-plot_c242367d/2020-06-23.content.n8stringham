<p>Does the US want to assassinate North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un? If
 real, a plan like that would certainly address a bunch of problems for 
the Trump administration, and for the rest of the world. Or, it would be
 just the kind of pretext the totalitarian regime north of the wall 
needs to start a nuclear war.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out North Korea really believes that the US and South 
Korea have been working together to kill Kim by using biochemical 
weapons.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://bgr.com/2017/05/04/iphone-8-leaked-image-design-render/">Don't Miss<span>:</span> <span>New iPhone 8 design leak may bring some very good news</span></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/05/asia/north-korea-kim-assassination/" rel="nofollow">CNN</a>, North Korean state news agency KCNA uncovered a “hideous” plot by a terrorist group that attempted to kill the supreme leader.</p>
<p>In a 1,800-word report, the agency said that the plot involved a 
North Korean citizen and the use of “biochemical substances including 
radioactive substance and nano poisonous substance” to target Kim during
 a major event such as a military parade. No evidence whatsoever was 
provided in the report.</p>
<p>This CNN paragraph tells the whole story and reads like a synopsis 
for an action movie that Hollywood should really consider making.</p>
<p>KCNA laid out the alleged plot in great detail, saying it was hatched
 in 2014 when the South Korean and US intelligence agencies recruited a 
North Korean working in the timber industry in eastern Russia. Further 
contacts were made over subsequent years, and the assassination attempt 
was to have taken place at a military parade, KCNA said.</p>
<p>The report didn’t say when the plot was foiled, but only that it was “uncovered and smashed” recently.</p>
<p>CNN points out that South Korea’s plans to kill Kim aren’t secret — 
well not all of them. There is at least one retaliatory plan that 
includes targeting North Korea’s leadership if South Korea feels 
threatened by nuclear attack.</p>
