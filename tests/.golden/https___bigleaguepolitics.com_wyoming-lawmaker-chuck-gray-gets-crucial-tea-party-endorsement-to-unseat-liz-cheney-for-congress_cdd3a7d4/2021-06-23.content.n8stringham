<p class="rm-manual">Jun 23, 2021</p>
<p>Wyoming state representative Chuck Gray has secured the crucial tea 
party endorsement of renowned political advisor Dick Morris in his bid 
to unseat Rep. Liz Cheney from office.</p>
<p>Morris became a popular pundit after dishing the dirt on the Clintons
 in books and media appearances. He believes that Gray is the best shot 
for conservatives to unseat Cheney after betraying her nation by voting 
for the Democrats’ blatantly unconstitutional impeachment of Donald 
Trump.</p>
<p>“If you are like me, your blood boiled when Congresswoman Liz Cheney 
threw President Trump under the bus by voting for his impeachment after 
he had left office… Fortunately, a great candidate has emerged in 
Wyoming to oppose her in next year’s election and everyone knows who he 
is: Chuck Gray,” Morris announced.</p>
<p>“I first met Chuck when I invited him to be my guest on my new TV 
show on NewsMax, Dick Morris’ Democracy. He is a true conservative and a
 devoted supporter of President Trump. As a Wyoming Republican State 
Rep, he has amassed quite a record of conservative action,” he added.</p>
<p>Morris explained that Gray has the bonafides to be a worthwhile 
replacement for Cheney, who was removed from her position of power 
within House GOP leadership due to her disreputable and disloyal 
actions.</p>
<p>“Pro-choice radicals, climate change militants, and those bent on 
winning elections through voter fraud do not intimidate Chuck. He has 
gotten awards from the American Conservative Union and Wyoming Right to 
Life for his service as a state legislator. He is just the kind of 
pro-Trump conservative we can rally behind to send Liz Cheney back to 
her Virginia home,” Morris said.</p>
<p>“I am beyond honored to have received Dick’s support in my campaign 
for Congress,” Gray said on Wednesday in response to Morris’ effusive 
praise.</p>
<p>Political consultant Rory McShane, who is working as a campaign 
strategist for Gray, believes that this news makes his candidate the 
presumptive frontrunner among the grassroots to unseat Cheney.</p>
<p>“At this point between leading cash on hand, leading in endorsements,
 leading in press coverage, and now the endorsement of Dick Morris, 
Chuck Gray has demonstrated he’s the only proven conservative who can 
take on Liz Cheney and win,” McShane said.</p>
<p>Big League Politics <a href="https://bigleaguepolitics.com/traitor-liz-cheney-argues-for-endless-war-in-the-middle-east-in-shameful-house-speech/">has reported</a>
 on how Cheney continues to lead the GOP astray with support for endless
 wars that put the troops in harm’s way for the prestige and profit of 
defense contractors, Pentagon brass, and other loyal servants of the 
military-industrial complex:</p>
<p>“Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/17/liz-cheney-puts-the-forever-in-forever-war/#.YMvABhcZuvw.twitter">argued for endless war in a Congressional speech</a>
 on Thursday calling for a reauthorization for the Authorization for Use
 of Military Force, which was used by former president George W. Bush as
 a pretense to invade Iraq.</p>
<p>“AUMF repeal without comprehensive replacement is dangerous, 
misguided, and ignores the security challenges facing our nation. This 
legislation removes a critical tool used by previous administrations – 
Republican and Democrat – to defeat terrorist threats originating in 
Iraq,” she said.</p>
<p>“This repeal would send a message of weakness to our adversaries and 
allies alike. Repealing this AUMF could prevent the U.S. from taking 
necessary action to counter Iranian proxies’ malign behavior, eliminate 
dangerous terrorists like Qassem Soleimani, and counter ISIS,” Cheney 
added…</p>
<p>The Cheney political dynasty is destined for disgrace, but that is 
too good for them. For their extensive war crimes, they should face 
tribunals as well.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Gray has received endorsements from over half a dozen 
current and former members of the Wyoming state legislature, showing 
that is he is revered by his colleagues. He has also earned Wyoming 
Right to Life’s highest honor for his legislative achievements on behalf
 of the unborn and has been rated the most conservative candidate for 
Congress in Wyoming by the American Conservative Union Foundation as 
well.</p>
