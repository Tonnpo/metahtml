<p class="rm-manual">North Korea's Great Leader would rather not fly for
 his second summit with Trump – but the trip is also a political message
 to China.</p>

<ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual">Kim Jong-un is already traveling for his summit with Trump on Wednesday.</li>
<li class="rm-manual">Rather than flying, he's taking a 60-hour train trip through China.</li>
<li class="rm-manual">The trip is a closely guarded secret, but this map shows the most likely itinerary.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Wednesday and Thursday, Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump will have their second summit, this time in Vietnam.</p>
<p>But while the U.S. president is still in DC, North Korea's Great 
Leader is already en route. That's because Kim is covering the distance 
between Pyongyang and Hanoi by slow train rather than fast plane.</p>
<p>The train trip is not just a vote of no confidence in the 
airworthiness of North Korea's winged fleet (1), it's also a political 
signal to China – the biggest (and only) ally the Hermit Kingdom has 
left in the world. And an example of the delightful weirdness the world 
will have to do without once the world's only remaining Stalinist 
dictatorship inevitably crumbles. </p>
<p>On Saturday, Kim boarded his special train in the North Korean 
capital Pyongyang. It's a 21-carriage, bullet-proof, army-green train 
that because of its armor plating reportedly can travel no faster than 
35 mph (56 km/h).</p>
<p>For China, the trip is a way of showing Kim what a communist regime 
that engages with capitalism can achieve: Bustling cities, a productive 
countryside, and a populace (largely) content to concentrate on the 
business of becoming rich (or at least less poor). </p>
<p>For North Korea, it's a clear admission of the indispensable role 
China plays in the survival of its hard-line regime. The hope may very 
well be that this show of allegiance will mollify Beijing enough to 
plead at the UN for some relief of the sanctions against Pyongyang – and
 to provide some food aid to prop up Kim's regime. </p>
<p>Kim's luxury train comes equipped with satellite telephone, 
conference rooms, dining cars and sleeping quarters. As shown on North 
Korean state media, some carriages have pink leather chairs and 
wide-screen TVs. Not shown: The carriage that, according to South Korean
 media, holds Kim's personal Mercedes-Benz. </p>
<p>North Korea's leaders love trains. The two previous members of the 
Kim dynasty had their own love affair with state trains. The first one, 
Kim Il Sung, regularly traveled abroad on his personal train – as far as
 Eastern Europe, back in 1984. His son (and the current Kim's father) 
Kim Jong-il, who ruled from the older Kim's death in 1994 to his own in 
2011, even died on his own train. The carriage in which Kim Jong-il 
expired is on display at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where he lies 
in state. </p>
<p>The exact itinerary and timetable of (this) Kim's slow train through 
China is a closely-guarded secret – but bits of his passage through the 
country have been recorded and posted on social media (<a href="https://twitter.com/shuangyinghe/status/1099702927839645696">here</a>, as the train drives through Zhengzhou, Henan province; and <a href="https://twitter.com/shuangyinghe/status/1100005838335422466">here</a>,
 in Yongzhou, Hunan province). Some show streets crossing the train's 
path completely empty, apparently closed off for traffic. </p>
<p> Satellite phones, pink leather chairs and Kim's own private 
Mercedes-Benz: if you're a Great Leader, you don't travel light - not 
even by train.Image: Dhaka Tribune</p>
<p>This map shows Kim's most likely itinerary, from the Sino-Korean 
border at Dandong via Beijing to Zhengzhou and Wuchang, crossing Nanning
 before arriving at the Vietnamese border at Dong Dang.</p>
<p> Undoubtedly playing havoc with China's decidedly high-speed train 
schedule, Kim's slow-speed trip is supposed to take about 60 hours (or 
two and a half days), which means he should arrive at the 
Sino-Vietnamese border some time on Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p> Vietnam, wary of Chinese invasion, has a different train gauge than 
China, so Kim's luxury vehicle can't make it any further without a 
complex and time-consuming change of wheels. When the Great Leader 
arrives at the Vietnamese border, he is expected to switch to cars for 
the last 105 miles (170 km) of the trip to Hanoi. </p>

<ul class="rm-manual">
<li class="rm-manual">During the coronavirus pandemic, students in close
 to 200 Big Picture Learning (BPL) schools worldwide have continued 
their education, thanks to BPL's unique school design. </li>
<li class="rm-manual">At BPL, each student is part of a small learning 
community of 15-20 students called an Advisory, led by a teacher called 
an Advisor. Students have community mentors, do off-campus internships, 
and even tackle college courses.</li>
<li class="rm-manual">Each Advisor truly knows the students in their 
Advisory. These close ties have allowed learning at BPL to respond and 
adapt to the challenges presented by coronavirus.</li>
</ul>
<p class="rm-manual"> &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a 
href="https://www.bigpicture.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Big Picture 
Learning&lt;/a&gt; (BPL) approaches its 25th year, we always ask the 
perennial questions: How are we positioned to grasp emerging 
opportunities that transform education systems and awaken the 
possibilities of an engaged population of learners? How might our vision
 and practice reflect the current, turbulent conditions? With the rules 
of engagement always being rewritten and old assumptions no longer 
viable, how do we "up our game" as an organization? We do this by 
constantly responding with our 'one student at a time, within a 
community of fellow learners' approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the 
current coronavirus crisis, our students in close to 200 schools 
worldwide have continued to engage in their learning because their BPL 
schools&lt;em&gt; know them&lt;/em&gt;—they are supported right now, 
wherever they are, to use their skills, interests and 
creativity.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;blockquote&gt;As one of our students stated 
early on to an Advisor, "We don't care what you know until we know that 
you care. Know us." &lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;Here's how BPL is different. We are a 
lively non-profit that proves all young people, including (and 
especially) our under-served urban and rural students, can succeed in 
high school, college, or any other post-secondary learning path, trade, 
service, business or professional career. We make it happen by sticking 
to three basic principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learning must be
 based on each student's interests and 
needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curriculum must be relevant to the student 
and allow them to do real work in the real world that also includes real
 work online.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students' growth and abilities must be
 measured by the quality of their work and how it changes 
them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, we strive to form deep 
ties that connect students, teachers and advisors, parents, mentors, and
 their entire community.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">How Big Picture Learning's schools work</h3>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;span 
style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"

<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;At BPL, each student is part of a small 
learning community of 15-20 students called an Advisory, led by a 
teacher called an Advisor. The Advisor helps each student create their 
own curriculum, a personal one that reflects and expands their own 
interests and aspirations. School days include off-campus internships 
generated from and guided by each student's interest—real-life training 
in real-world work. It could be in a design studio, research lab, 
recording studio, law office, bank, airport hangar, hospital—it could be
 anywhere, including online. BPL students also take college courses. 
Every quarter they exhibit their work to their Advisor, peers, parents, 
mentors and the community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each student also
 has an adult mentor outside of school. The parent or adult advocate of 
each student is also actively enlisted as still another resource for 
student learning and for the school community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big 
Picture Learning clicks because the student is the curriculum and the 
community is the school, where everyone is engaged in the learning 
journey of each and every student.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;During the coronavirus pandemic, our 
students have continued their education, fully supported. We have many 
students who have continued their community-based internships remotely 
because they have close ties with their mentors and Advisors. Four of 
our students who have had an internship with a newspaper recently 
published &lt;a 
href="https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/special/coronavirus/teens-interrupted-569735292.html"
 target="_blank"&gt;their coronavirus experiences&lt;/a&gt; in their 
city newspaper. A student with a &lt;a 
href="https://www.harborfreightfellows.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Harbor 
Freight Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; in the skilled trades is continuing to 
build a Tiny House with online mentor and advisor 
support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Advisors are not only in contact with 
each other and their students, but they are connecting across schools, 
districts, states and internationally. Advisors in California and 
Washington are arranging for their students to connect with BPL students
 in Europe to build relationships, collaborate on projects and to attend
 each other's online exhibitions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;Twelve years ago,&lt;a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Christensen" 
target="_blank"&gt; Clayton Christensen&lt;/a&gt; spent time with&lt;a 
href="https://www.bigpicture.org/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;BPL and
 here's what he said, "Big Picture Learning is a perfect example of a 
heavyweight team that has redefined—indeed, revolutionized—schooling. By
 bringing students and their interests to the forefront, Big Picture 
Learning is a model of student-centered learning, which is key to 
intrinsically motivating students to provide them with the education 
they deserve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clay makes great points about BPL. He 
captures our essence. We strive to make the shift from an intervention 
model of education to a prevention design where learning is 
interest-driven, productive and self-directed, where teachers are with 
students on their learning journeys and not constantly doing something 
to students. This is how students get engaged. As one of our students 
stated early on to an Advisor, "We don't care what you know until we 
know that you care. Know us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on BPL's 
work, David Gersten, one of our board members, told me today, "Pain that
 is not transformed is transmitted." In these times and always, this is 
BPL. This is how we tick and why we click.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;In January, China made history when it 
landed its &lt;a 
href="https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/china-lands-craft-on-far-side-of-moon"
 target="_blank"&gt;Chang'e-4 spacecraft on the far side of the 
moon&lt;/a&gt;. The mission was also the first to experiment with 
growing plants on the moon, and it brought to the lunar surface a 
mini-biosphere called the Lunar Micro Ecosystem (LME). The conditions 
within this small, cylindrical biosphere were similar to those on Earth,
 besides the microgravity and cosmic radiation. The LME 
contained:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;potato 
seeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cotton seeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;rape

except the cotton. Now, a &lt;a 
href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/china-change-4-plants/" 
target="_blank"&gt;new 3D reconstruction shows that the cotton plant 
grew not one, but two leaves&lt;/a&gt; before dying due to the cold 
temperatures after about two weeks. The results suggest that the

thought.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leader of China's experiment, 
Xie Gengxin of the advanced Technology Research Institute at Chongqing

research. But he hopes to continue studying how various lifeforms might 
be able to survive on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">Why NASA wants to grow plants in space</h3>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;Learning how to reliably grow plants in 
space is necessary if NASA or other space agencies want to launch 
long-term missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Simply packing some 
multi-vitamins will not be enough to keep astronauts healthy as they 
explore deep space," NASA &lt;a 
href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/growing-plants-in-space" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in April. 
"They will need fresh produce."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Some reasons are 
logistical. For example, the nutrients in supplements and prepared meals
 will break down over time, and radiation could accelerate that process.
 So, growing fresh produce would give astronauts access to fresher 
nutrients, not to mention better tasting food. Also, if astronauts could
 grow plants on spaceships, they wouldn't have to carry as much prepared
 food onboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are also psychological 
benefits to growing plants in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We already know 
from our pioneering astronauts that fresh flowers and gardens on the 
International Space Station create a beautiful atmosphere and let us 
take a little piece of Earth with us on our journeys," NASA wrote. 
"They're good for our psychological well-being on Earth and in 
space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA is also interested in making dining in 
space a pleasant experience for astronauts. For example, the agency has 
packed comfort food and &lt;a 
href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/home/F_Holiday_Dinner_in_Space.html"
 target="_blank"&gt;holiday meals&lt;/a&gt; on recent missions, and has 
conducted research on astronauts' preference for &lt;a 
href="https://www.eater.com/2015/9/17/9338665/space-food-nasa-astronauts-mars"
 target="_blank"&gt;communal versus solo dining&lt;/a&gt;, as well as 
whether they benefit from cooking food themselves. Other researchers are
 exploring how space dining can fulfill astronauts' emotional needs, and
 also how to counteract phenomenon specific to space travel, &lt;a 
href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/space-food/overview/" 
target="_blank"&gt;such as the loss of the sense of 
smell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"At the end of the day, we're not worried 
about the muscle cells," NASA nutritionist Scott Smith told &lt;a 
href="https://www.eater.com/2015/9/17/9338665/space-food-nasa-astronauts-mars"
 target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eater&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "We're worried

<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;The initial European trials for gaboxadol 
produced positive results. Merck and Lundbeck were convinced they had a 
blockbuster drug on their hands. Researchers considered it a major 
improvement on Ambien, which sometimes left users feeling groggy the 
next day. Gaboxadol also didn't produce negative effects when mixed with
 alcohol, making it a rare sleeping pill. Then the US trials 
began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug bombed. In 2007, the pharmaceutical 
giants canceled development of the drug; Lundbeck sold the rights to it 
in 2015. While no specific reason for its failure has been stated, 
pharmacology professor Richard J Miller &lt;a 
href="https://bookshop.org/books/drugged-the-science-and-culture-behind-psychotropic-drugs/9780190235956"
 target="_blank"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; that the protein molecule that 
carries gaboxadol also transports amino acids, such as tryptophan, 
across the blood-brain barrier. Since Americans consume 20 percent more 
daily calories from meat than Europeans, gaboxadol likely failed because
 it was competing with extra tryptophan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs are 
complex. A one-size-fits-all approach to drug development often doesn't 
work. If gaboxadol works for vegetarians, should it be reconsidered? 
Perhaps in a research field focused on individualized medicine, but 
that's not the system we live in. Gaboxadol is now being studied for use
 in treatments of Fragile X syndrome and Angelman syndrome. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons a drug might work for you and 
not me. This is true of antibiotics and vaccines, though these classes 
of drugs have a solid track record. When considering more controversial 
treatments, such as antidepressants, the story changes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

 target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Journal 
of Affective Disorders&lt;/em&gt;, investigating the efficacy of 
antidepressants in overweight users. A team at McGill University 
reviewed 12 studies that focused on SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic 
antidepressants, and tetracyclic antidepressants conducted between 
2004-2019. Eleven of them found that weight class or body mass index 
(BMI) negatively affect the efficacy of these 
antidepressants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive scoping 
review from the McGill team is troubling for two reasons. First, obesity
 is already a predictor for depression. Second, weight gain is 
&lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a side effect of antidepressants, implying 
that their efficacy could dwindle with long-term usage. Recent evidence 
&lt;a 
href="https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/antidepressants-withdrawal"
 target="_self"&gt;confirms&lt;/a&gt; that extended usage of 
antidepressants results in withdrawal symptoms that persist for over a 
year, obesity included in that list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the 
study, over 300 million people suffer from depression around the world. 
The WHO reports that depression is the leading cause of disability 
worldwide. Pharmaceutical intervention is problematic with roughly half 
of prescription users. While the reasons for this are not well 
understood, obese and overweight patients suffer from 
treatment-resistant depression at higher rates than those with normal 
weight. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;The researchers offer a few possibilities 
for why being overweight could negatively affect antidepressants. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antidepressants might not dissolve as 
effectively in increased body fat. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Variations in 
plasma concentrations are caused by extra adipose tissue. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obese patients are more likely to be on other 
drugs, any of which could effect the efficacy of antidepressants. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity is a state of systemic low grade 
inflammation that impacts how drugs act in the body. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excess adipose tissue secretes more adipokines, 
suppressing neurotransmitter systems. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Levels of 
leptin, the hormone that signals hunger, are compromised as weight gain 
increases. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetic factors, such as 
neurotransmitter receptors and drug metabolizing enzymes, could play a 
role. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comorbid medical conditions—sleep apnea, 
asthma, metabolic syndrome—can contribute to depression as well as 
dampen the response to medications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This 
wide range of potential factors shows the complexity of drug 
interactions within the human body. One thing is clear from the McGill 
team's review: being overweight reduces the efficacy of the world's most
 popular antidepressants. This trend reiterates the need for better 
mental treatments, such as psychotherapy and psychedelic therapy. The 
time for an overhaul of the psychiatry industry and its reliance on this
 class of drugs has come.

<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/">Surprising Science</a> </p>
<p class="rm-manual">What would happen if you stuck your body inside a particle accelerator?</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> &lt;p&gt; The scenario seems like the start of a 
bad Marvel comic, but it happens to shed light on our intuitions about 
radiation, the vulnerability of the human body, and the very nature of 
matter. Particle accelerators allow physicists to study subatomic 
particles by speeding them up in powerful magnetic fields and then 
tracing the interactions that result from collisions. By delving into 
the mysteries of the Universe, colliders have entered the Zeitgeist and 
tapped the wonders and fears of our age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far back 
as 2008, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), operated by the European 
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), was charged with creating 
&lt;a 
href="https://home.cern/about/physics/extra-dimensions-gravitons-and-tiny-black-holes"
 target="_blank"&gt;microscopic black holes&lt;/a&gt; that would allow 
physicists to detect extra dimensions. To many, this sounds like the 
plot of a disastrous science-fiction movie. It came as no surprise when 
two people filed a lawsuit to stop the LHC from operating, lest it 
produce a black hole powerful enough to destroy the world. But 
physicists argued that the idea was absurd and the lawsuit was 
rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2012, the LHC detected the 
long-sought Higgs boson, a particle needed to explain how particles 
acquire mass. With that major accomplishment, the LHC entered popular 
culture; it was featured on the album cover of &lt;em&gt;Super 
Collider&lt;/em&gt; (2013) by the heavy metal band Megadeth, and was a 
plot point in the US television series &lt;em&gt;The Flash&lt;/em&gt; 
(2014-).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite its accomplishments and glamour,
 the world of particle physics is so abstract that few understand its 
implications, meaning or use. Unlike a NASA probe sent to Mars, CERN's 
research doesn't produce stunning, tangible images. Instead, the study 
of particle physics is best described by chalkboard equations and 
squiggly lines called Feynman diagrams. Aage Bohr, the Nobel laureate 
whose father Niels invented the Bohr model of the atom, and his 
colleague Ole Ulfbeck have even gone as far as to deny the physical 
existence of subatomic particles as anything more than mathematical 
models.&lt;/p&gt; </p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;Which returns us to our original question:
 what happens when a beam of subatomic particles travelling at nearly 
the speed of light meets the flesh of the human body? Perhaps because 
the realms of particle physics and biology are conceptually so far 
removed, it's not only laypeople who lack the intuition to answer this 
question, but also some professional physicists. In a &lt;a 
href="https://youtu.be/_NMqPT6oKJ8" target="_blank"&gt;2010 YouTube 
interview&lt;/a&gt; with members of the physics and astronomy faculty at
 the University of Nottingham, several academic experts admitted that 
they had little idea what would happen if one were to stick a hand 
inside the proton beam at the LHC. Professor Michael Merrifield put it 
succinctly: 'That's a good question&lt;em&gt;. I don't know&lt;/em&gt; 
is the answer. Probably be very bad for you.' Professor Laurence Eaves 
was also cautious about drawing conclusions. '[B]y the scales of energy 
we notice, it wouldn't be that noticeable,' he said, likely with a bit 
of British understatement. 'Would I put my hand in the beam? I'm not 
sure about that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such thought experiments can be 
useful tools for exploring situations that can't be studied in the 
laboratory. Occasionally, however, unfortunate accidents yield case 
studies: opportunities for researchers to study scenarios that can't be 
experimentally induced for ethical reasons. Case studies have a sample 
size of one and no control group. But, as the neuroscientist V S 
Ramachandran has pointed out in &lt;em&gt;Phantoms in the 
Brain&lt;/em&gt; (1998), it takes only one talking pig to prove that 
pigs can talk. On 13 September 1848, for example, an iron rod pierced 
through the head of the US railway worker Phineas Gage and profoundly 
changed his personality, offering early evidence of a biological basis 
for personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on 13 July 1978, a Soviet 
scientist named Anatoli Bugorski stuck his head in a particle 
accelerator. On that fateful day, Bugorski was checking malfunctioning 
equipment on the U-70 synchrotron – the largest particle accelerator in 
the Soviet Union – when a safety mechanism failed and a beam of protons 
travelling at nearly the speed of light passed straight through his 
head, Phineas Gage-style. It's possible that, at that point in history, 
no other human being had ever experienced a focused beam of radiation at
 such high energy. Although proton therapy – a cancer treatment that 
uses proton beams to destroy tumours – was pioneered before Bugorski's 
accident, the energy of these beams is generally not above 250 million 
electron volts (a unit of energy used for small particles). Bugorski 
might have experienced the full wrath of a beam with more than 300 times
 this much energy, 76 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; electron 
volts.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;Proton radiation is a rare beast indeed. 
Protons from the solar wind and cosmic rays are stopped by Earth's 
atmosphere, and proton radiation is so rare in radioactive decay that it
 was not observed until 1970. More familiar threats, such as ultraviolet
 photons and alpha particles, do not penetrate the body past skin unless
 a radioactive source is ingested. Russian dissident Alexander 
Litvinenko, for instance, was killed by alpha particles that do not so 
much as penetrate paper when he unknowingly ingested radioactive 
polonium-210 delivered by an assassin. But when Apollo astronauts 
protected by spacesuits were exposed to cosmic rays containing protons 
and even more exotic forms of radiation, they &lt;a 
href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/183/4128/957.full.pdf+html" 
target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; flashes of visual light, a 
harbinger of what would welcome Bugorski on the fateful day of his 
accident. According to an interview in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; 
magazine in 1997, Bugorski immediately saw an intense flash of light but
 felt no pain. The young scientist was taken to a clinic in Moscow with 
half his face swollen, and doctors expected the 
worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ionising radiation particles such as protons 
wreak havoc on the body by breaking chemical bonds in DNA. This assault 
on a cell's genetic programming can kill the cell, stop it from 
dividing, or induce a cancerous mutation. Cells that divide quickly, 
such as stem cells in bone marrow, suffer the most. Because blood cells 
are produced in bone marrow, for instance, many cases of radiation 
poisoning result in infection and anaemia from losses of white blood 
cells and red blood cells, respectively. But unique to Bugorski's case, 
radiation was concentrated along a narrow beam through the head, rather 
than being broadly distributed from nuclear fallout, as was the case for
 many victims of the Chernobyl disaster or the bombing of Hiroshima. For
 Bugorski, particularly vulnerable tissues, such as bone marrow and the 
gastrointestinal track, might have been largely spared. But where the 
beam shot through Bugorski's head, it deposited an obscene amount of 
radiation energy, hundreds of times greater than a lethal dose by some 
estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, Bugorski is still alive today. 
Half his face is paralysed, giving one hemisphere of his head a 
strangely young appearance. He is reported to be deaf in one ear. He 
suffered at least six generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Commonly known 
as &lt;em&gt;grand mal&lt;/em&gt; seizures, these are the seizures most 
frequently depicted in film and television, involving convulsions and 
loss of consciousness. Bugorski's epilepsy is likely a result of brain 
tissue-scarring left by the proton beam. It has also left him with 
&lt;em&gt;petit mal&lt;/em&gt; or absence seizures, far less dramatic 
staring spells during which consciousness is briefly interrupted. There 
are no reports that Bugorski has ever been diagnosed with cancer, though
 that is often a long-term consequence of radiation 
exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite having nothing less than a particle 
accelerator beam pass through his brain, Bugorski's intellect remained 
intact, and he successfully completed his doctorate after the accident. 
Bugorski survived his accident. And as frightening and awesome as the 
inside of a particle accelerator might be, humanity has thus far 
survived the nuclear age.&lt;img
