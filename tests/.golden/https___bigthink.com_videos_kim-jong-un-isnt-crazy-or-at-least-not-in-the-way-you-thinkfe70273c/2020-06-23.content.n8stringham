<h1 class="rm-manual"> Kim Jong Un Isn't Crazy (Or At Least Not in the Way You Think) </h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://bigthink.com/u/victorcha">Victor Cha</a> </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Victor Cha is the former Director for Asian Affairs
 at the National Security Council, where he served as an advisor to the 
President from 2004-2007. The recipient of two Outstanding Service 
Commendations during his tenure at the White House, Cha is also the 
award-winning author of Alignment Despite Antagonismand Beyond the Final
 Score: The Politics of Sport in Asia. His writing has appeared in 
Foreign Affairs,International Security, and Political Science Quarterly,
 among other journals. As an expert on North Korea, he has been 
interviewed on many national news outlets, including ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN,
 Fox, PBS News,and he has written on the topic for the New York Times, 
the Washington Post, the Financial Times, the LosAngeles Times, and for 
USA Today. Cha currently holds the D.S. Song Chair in Government in the 
School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and is a senior

<p class="rm-manual"><span>03 December, 2012</span></p>
<p><span>So you might wonder what is the main misconception that exists 
about North Korea, and I guess the one I would focus on is this notion 
that they are crazy and irrational. The regime certainly operates 
according to its own very risk-acceptant rationality, so they’re much 
more willing to shake up the card table, if you will, and threaten the 
whole game because they know that we, meaning the rest of the world, 
have much more at stake in peace than they do. When you have less to 
lose, you’re much more willing to be risk acceptant, much more willing 
to be belligerent, and so I think there is certainly an element of that 
in North Korean rationality. But they’re not crazy. They’re quite 
rational in terms of how they behave. </span></p>
<p><span>I think another misconception that people have is that somehow 
this really doesn't matter for the average American because it is this 
small, kind of harmless country that is simply trying to prop its 
leadership up and wants goodies from the United States and others to 
allow this leadership to look good. And I think to an extent that's 
true, but I think one of the things that you have to remember is, this 
would be harmless if they were not pursuing weapons of mass destruction 
and ballistic missiles. Then, it would be harmless. But the fact of the 
matter is, they are on a systematic path to try to create long-range 
missiles with nuclear warheads that can reach the United States. That 
makes it a very serious threat. </span></p>
<p><span>I think a lot of the parodies that we see about North Korea, in
 many ways, is filling a void because we don't have any other good 
information about what is going on inside North Korea. We just see 
pictures of a quirky leadership and we don't have a lot of facts behind 
that. So, these caricatures and these comic strips and these movies that
 we see sort of fill a void of information that, at the same time, is 
quite worrying. I mean, the fact that we don't have that information is 
quite worrying. </span></p>
<p class="rm-manual">Directed / Produced by</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Jonathan Fowler &amp; Elizabeth Rodd</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Victor Cha says that North Korea's leadership is 
not the comic strip version that it is made out to be. As a matter of 
fact, they are quite rational. We simply just don't have a lot of facts.

<ul class="rm-manual">
<li class="rm-manual">During the coronavirus pandemic, students in close
 to 200 Big Picture Learning (BPL) schools worldwide have continued 
their education, thanks to BPL's unique school design. </li>
<li class="rm-manual">At BPL, each student is part of a small learning 
community of 15-20 students called an Advisory, led by a teacher called 
an Advisor. Students have community mentors, do off-campus internships, 
and even tackle college courses.</li>
<li class="rm-manual">Each Advisor truly knows the students in their 
Advisory. These close ties have allowed learning at BPL to respond and 
adapt to the challenges presented by coronavirus.</li>
</ul>
<p class="rm-manual"> &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a 
href="https://www.bigpicture.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Big Picture 
Learning&lt;/a&gt; (BPL) approaches its 25th year, we always ask the 
perennial questions: How are we positioned to grasp emerging 
opportunities that transform education systems and awaken the 
possibilities of an engaged population of learners? How might our vision
 and practice reflect the current, turbulent conditions? With the rules 
of engagement always being rewritten and old assumptions no longer 
viable, how do we "up our game" as an organization? We do this by 
constantly responding with our 'one student at a time, within a 
community of fellow learners' approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the 
current coronavirus crisis, our students in close to 200 schools 
worldwide have continued to engage in their learning because their BPL 
schools&lt;em&gt; know them&lt;/em&gt;—they are supported right now, 
wherever they are, to use their skills, interests and 
creativity.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;blockquote&gt;As one of our students stated 
early on to an Advisor, "We don't care what you know until we know that 
you care. Know us." &lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;Here's how BPL is different. We are a 
lively non-profit that proves all young people, including (and 
especially) our under-served urban and rural students, can succeed in 
high school, college, or any other post-secondary learning path, trade, 
service, business or professional career. We make it happen by sticking 
to three basic principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learning must be
 based on each student's interests and 
needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curriculum must be relevant to the student 
and allow them to do real work in the real world that also includes real
 work online.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students' growth and abilities must be
 measured by the quality of their work and how it changes 
them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, we strive to form deep 
ties that connect students, teachers and advisors, parents, mentors, and
 their entire community.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">How Big Picture Learning's schools work</h3>

<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;At BPL, each student is part of a small 
learning community of 15-20 students called an Advisory, led by a 
teacher called an Advisor. The Advisor helps each student create their 
own curriculum, a personal one that reflects and expands their own 
interests and aspirations. School days include off-campus internships 
generated from and guided by each student's interest—real-life training 
in real-world work. It could be in a design studio, research lab, 
recording studio, law office, bank, airport hangar, hospital—it could be
 anywhere, including online. BPL students also take college courses. 
Every quarter they exhibit their work to their Advisor, peers, parents, 
mentors and the community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each student also
 has an adult mentor outside of school. The parent or adult advocate of 
each student is also actively enlisted as still another resource for 
student learning and for the school community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big 
Picture Learning clicks because the student is the curriculum and the 
community is the school, where everyone is engaged in the learning 
journey of each and every student.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;During the coronavirus pandemic, our 
students have continued their education, fully supported. We have many 
students who have continued their community-based internships remotely 
because they have close ties with their mentors and Advisors. Four of 
our students who have had an internship with a newspaper recently 
published &lt;a 
href="https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/special/coronavirus/teens-interrupted-569735292.html"
 target="_blank"&gt;their coronavirus experiences&lt;/a&gt; in their 
city newspaper. A student with a &lt;a 
href="https://www.harborfreightfellows.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Harbor 
Freight Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; in the skilled trades is continuing to 
build a Tiny House with online mentor and advisor 
support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Advisors are not only in contact with 
each other and their students, but they are connecting across schools, 
districts, states and internationally. Advisors in California and 
Washington are arranging for their students to connect with BPL students
 in Europe to build relationships, collaborate on projects and to attend
 each other's online exhibitions.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;Twelve years ago,&lt;a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Christensen" 
target="_blank"&gt; Clayton Christensen&lt;/a&gt; spent time with&lt;a 
href="https://www.bigpicture.org/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;BPL and
 here's what he said, "Big Picture Learning is a perfect example of a 
heavyweight team that has redefined—indeed, revolutionized—schooling. By
 bringing students and their interests to the forefront, Big Picture 
Learning is a model of student-centered learning, which is key to 
intrinsically motivating students to provide them with the education 
they deserve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clay makes great points about BPL. He 
captures our essence. We strive to make the shift from an intervention 
model of education to a prevention design where learning is 
interest-driven, productive and self-directed, where teachers are with 
students on their learning journeys and not constantly doing something 
to students. This is how students get engaged. As one of our students 
stated early on to an Advisor, "We don't care what you know until we 
know that you care. Know us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on BPL's 
work, David Gersten, one of our board members, told me today, "Pain that
 is not transformed is transmitted." In these times and always, this is 
BPL. This is how we tick and why we click.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;The initial European trials for gaboxadol 
produced positive results. Merck and Lundbeck were convinced they had a 
blockbuster drug on their hands. Researchers considered it a major 
improvement on Ambien, which sometimes left users feeling groggy the 
next day. Gaboxadol also didn't produce negative effects when mixed with
 alcohol, making it a rare sleeping pill. Then the US trials 
began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug bombed. In 2007, the pharmaceutical 
giants canceled development of the drug; Lundbeck sold the rights to it 
in 2015. While no specific reason for its failure has been stated, 
pharmacology professor Richard J Miller &lt;a 
href="https://bookshop.org/books/drugged-the-science-and-culture-behind-psychotropic-drugs/9780190235956"
 target="_blank"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; that the protein molecule that 
carries gaboxadol also transports amino acids, such as tryptophan, 
across the blood-brain barrier. Since Americans consume 20 percent more 
daily calories from meat than Europeans, gaboxadol likely failed because
 it was competing with extra tryptophan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs are 
complex. A one-size-fits-all approach to drug development often doesn't 
work. If gaboxadol works for vegetarians, should it be reconsidered? 
Perhaps in a research field focused on individualized medicine, but 
that's not the system we live in. Gaboxadol is now being studied for use
 in treatments of Fragile X syndrome and Angelman syndrome. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons a drug might work for you and 
not me. This is true of antibiotics and vaccines, though these classes 
of drugs have a solid track record. When considering more controversial 
treatments, such as antidepressants, the story changes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

 target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Journal 
of Affective Disorders&lt;/em&gt;, investigating the efficacy of 
antidepressants in overweight users. A team at McGill University 
reviewed 12 studies that focused on SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic 
antidepressants, and tetracyclic antidepressants conducted between 
2004-2019. Eleven of them found that weight class or body mass index 
(BMI) negatively affect the efficacy of these 
antidepressants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive scoping 
review from the McGill team is troubling for two reasons. First, obesity
 is already a predictor for depression. Second, weight gain is 
&lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a side effect of antidepressants, implying 
that their efficacy could dwindle with long-term usage. Recent evidence 
&lt;a 
href="https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/antidepressants-withdrawal"
 target="_self"&gt;confirms&lt;/a&gt; that extended usage of 
antidepressants results in withdrawal symptoms that persist for over a 
year, obesity included in that list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the 
study, over 300 million people suffer from depression around the world. 
The WHO reports that depression is the leading cause of disability 
worldwide. Pharmaceutical intervention is problematic with roughly half 
of prescription users. While the reasons for this are not well 
understood, obese and overweight patients suffer from 
treatment-resistant depression at higher rates than those with normal 
weight. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

effectively in increased body fat. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Variations in 
plasma concentrations are caused by extra adipose tissue. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obese patients are more likely to be on other 
drugs, any of which could effect the efficacy of antidepressants. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity is a state of systemic low grade 
inflammation that impacts how drugs act in the body. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excess adipose tissue secretes more adipokines, 
suppressing neurotransmitter systems. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Levels of 
leptin, the hormone that signals hunger, are compromised as weight gain 
increases. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetic factors, such as 
neurotransmitter receptors and drug metabolizing enzymes, could play a 
role. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comorbid medical conditions—sleep apnea, 
asthma, metabolic syndrome—can contribute to depression as well as 
dampen the response to medications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This 
wide range of potential factors shows the complexity of drug 
interactions within the human body. One thing is clear from the McGill 
team's review: being overweight reduces the efficacy of the world's most
 popular antidepressants. This trend reiterates the need for better 
mental treatments, such as psychotherapy and psychedelic therapy. The 
time for an overhaul of the psychiatry industry and its reliance on this
 class of drugs has come.

<p class="rm-manual">What would happen if you stuck your body inside a particle accelerator?</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> &lt;p&gt; The scenario seems like the start of a 
bad Marvel comic, but it happens to shed light on our intuitions about 
radiation, the vulnerability of the human body, and the very nature of 
matter. Particle accelerators allow physicists to study subatomic 
particles by speeding them up in powerful magnetic fields and then 
tracing the interactions that result from collisions. By delving into 
the mysteries of the Universe, colliders have entered the Zeitgeist and 
tapped the wonders and fears of our age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far back 
as 2008, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), operated by the European 
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), was charged with creating 
&lt;a 
href="https://home.cern/about/physics/extra-dimensions-gravitons-and-tiny-black-holes"
 target="_blank"&gt;microscopic black holes&lt;/a&gt; that would allow 
physicists to detect extra dimensions. To many, this sounds like the 
plot of a disastrous science-fiction movie. It came as no surprise when 
two people filed a lawsuit to stop the LHC from operating, lest it 
produce a black hole powerful enough to destroy the world. But 
physicists argued that the idea was absurd and the lawsuit was 
rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2012, the LHC detected the 
long-sought Higgs boson, a particle needed to explain how particles 
acquire mass. With that major accomplishment, the LHC entered popular 
culture; it was featured on the album cover of &lt;em&gt;Super 
Collider&lt;/em&gt; (2013) by the heavy metal band Megadeth, and was a 
plot point in the US television series &lt;em&gt;The Flash&lt;/em&gt; 
(2014-).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite its accomplishments and glamour,
 the world of particle physics is so abstract that few understand its 
implications, meaning or use. Unlike a NASA probe sent to Mars, CERN's 
research doesn't produce stunning, tangible images. Instead, the study 
of particle physics is best described by chalkboard equations and 
squiggly lines called Feynman diagrams. Aage Bohr, the Nobel laureate 
whose father Niels invented the Bohr model of the atom, and his 
colleague Ole Ulfbeck have even gone as far as to deny the physical 
existence of subatomic particles as anything more than mathematical 
models.&lt;/p&gt; </p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;Which returns us to our original question:
 what happens when a beam of subatomic particles travelling at nearly 
the speed of light meets the flesh of the human body? Perhaps because 
the realms of particle physics and biology are conceptually so far 
removed, it's not only laypeople who lack the intuition to answer this 
question, but also some professional physicists. In a &lt;a 
href="https://youtu.be/_NMqPT6oKJ8" target="_blank"&gt;2010 YouTube 
interview&lt;/a&gt; with members of the physics and astronomy faculty at
 the University of Nottingham, several academic experts admitted that 
they had little idea what would happen if one were to stick a hand 
inside the proton beam at the LHC. Professor Michael Merrifield put it 
succinctly: 'That's a good question&lt;em&gt;. I don't know&lt;/em&gt; 
is the answer. Probably be very bad for you.' Professor Laurence Eaves 
was also cautious about drawing conclusions. '[B]y the scales of energy 
we notice, it wouldn't be that noticeable,' he said, likely with a bit 
of British understatement. 'Would I put my hand in the beam? I'm not 
sure about that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such thought experiments can be 
useful tools for exploring situations that can't be studied in the 
laboratory. Occasionally, however, unfortunate accidents yield case 
studies: opportunities for researchers to study scenarios that can't be 
experimentally induced for ethical reasons. Case studies have a sample 
size of one and no control group. But, as the neuroscientist V S 
Ramachandran has pointed out in &lt;em&gt;Phantoms in the 
Brain&lt;/em&gt; (1998), it takes only one talking pig to prove that 
pigs can talk. On 13 September 1848, for example, an iron rod pierced 
through the head of the US railway worker Phineas Gage and profoundly 
changed his personality, offering early evidence of a biological basis 
for personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on 13 July 1978, a Soviet 
scientist named Anatoli Bugorski stuck his head in a particle 
accelerator. On that fateful day, Bugorski was checking malfunctioning 
equipment on the U-70 synchrotron – the largest particle accelerator in 
the Soviet Union – when a safety mechanism failed and a beam of protons 
travelling at nearly the speed of light passed straight through his 
head, Phineas Gage-style. It's possible that, at that point in history, 
no other human being had ever experienced a focused beam of radiation at
 such high energy. Although proton therapy – a cancer treatment that 
uses proton beams to destroy tumours – was pioneered before Bugorski's 
accident, the energy of these beams is generally not above 250 million 
electron volts (a unit of energy used for small particles). Bugorski 
might have experienced the full wrath of a beam with more than 300 times
 this much energy, 76 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; electron 
volts.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;Proton radiation is a rare beast indeed. 
Protons from the solar wind and cosmic rays are stopped by Earth's 
atmosphere, and proton radiation is so rare in radioactive decay that it
 was not observed until 1970. More familiar threats, such as ultraviolet
 photons and alpha particles, do not penetrate the body past skin unless
 a radioactive source is ingested. Russian dissident Alexander 
Litvinenko, for instance, was killed by alpha particles that do not so 
much as penetrate paper when he unknowingly ingested radioactive 
polonium-210 delivered by an assassin. But when Apollo astronauts 
protected by spacesuits were exposed to cosmic rays containing protons 
and even more exotic forms of radiation, they &lt;a 
href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/183/4128/957.full.pdf+html" 
target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; flashes of visual light, a 
harbinger of what would welcome Bugorski on the fateful day of his 
accident. According to an interview in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; 
magazine in 1997, Bugorski immediately saw an intense flash of light but
 felt no pain. The young scientist was taken to a clinic in Moscow with 
half his face swollen, and doctors expected the 
worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ionising radiation particles such as protons 
wreak havoc on the body by breaking chemical bonds in DNA. This assault 
on a cell's genetic programming can kill the cell, stop it from 
dividing, or induce a cancerous mutation. Cells that divide quickly, 
such as stem cells in bone marrow, suffer the most. Because blood cells 
are produced in bone marrow, for instance, many cases of radiation 
poisoning result in infection and anaemia from losses of white blood 
cells and red blood cells, respectively. But unique to Bugorski's case, 
radiation was concentrated along a narrow beam through the head, rather 
than being broadly distributed from nuclear fallout, as was the case for
 many victims of the Chernobyl disaster or the bombing of Hiroshima. For
 Bugorski, particularly vulnerable tissues, such as bone marrow and the 
gastrointestinal track, might have been largely spared. But where the 
beam shot through Bugorski's head, it deposited an obscene amount of 
radiation energy, hundreds of times greater than a lethal dose by some 
estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, Bugorski is still alive today. 
Half his face is paralysed, giving one hemisphere of his head a 
strangely young appearance. He is reported to be deaf in one ear. He 
suffered at least six generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Commonly known 
as &lt;em&gt;grand mal&lt;/em&gt; seizures, these are the seizures most 
frequently depicted in film and television, involving convulsions and 
loss of consciousness. Bugorski's epilepsy is likely a result of brain 
tissue-scarring left by the proton beam. It has also left him with 
&lt;em&gt;petit mal&lt;/em&gt; or absence seizures, far less dramatic 
staring spells during which consciousness is briefly interrupted. There 
are no reports that Bugorski has ever been diagnosed with cancer, though
 that is often a long-term consequence of radiation 
exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite having nothing less than a particle 
accelerator beam pass through his brain, Bugorski's intellect remained 
intact, and he successfully completed his doctorate after the accident. 
Bugorski survived his accident. And as frightening and awesome as the 
inside of a particle accelerator might be, humanity has thus far 
survived the nuclear age.&lt;img

<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;In January, China made history when it 
landed its &lt;a 
href="https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/china-lands-craft-on-far-side-of-moon"
 target="_blank"&gt;Chang'e-4 spacecraft on the far side of the 
moon&lt;/a&gt;. The mission was also the first to experiment with 
growing plants on the moon, and it brought to the lunar surface a 
mini-biosphere called the Lunar Micro Ecosystem (LME). The conditions 
within this small, cylindrical biosphere were similar to those on Earth,
 besides the microgravity and cosmic radiation. The LME 
contained:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;potato

except the cotton. Now, a &lt;a

be able to survive on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">Why NASA wants to grow plants in space</h3>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;Learning how to reliably grow plants in 
space is necessary if NASA or other space agencies want to launch 
long-term missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Simply packing some 
multi-vitamins will not be enough to keep astronauts healthy as they 
explore deep space," NASA &lt;a 
href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/growing-plants-in-space" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in April. 
"They will need fresh produce."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Some reasons are 
logistical. For example, the nutrients in supplements and prepared meals
 will break down over time, and radiation could accelerate that process.
 So, growing fresh produce would give astronauts access to fresher 
nutrients, not to mention better tasting food. Also, if astronauts could
 grow plants on spaceships, they wouldn't have to carry as much prepared
 food onboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are also psychological 
benefits to growing plants in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We already know 
from our pioneering astronauts that fresh flowers and gardens on the 
International Space Station create a beautiful atmosphere and let us 
take a little piece of Earth with us on our journeys," NASA wrote. 
"They're good for our psychological well-being on Earth and in 
space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA is also interested in making dining in 
space a pleasant experience for astronauts. For example, the agency has 
packed comfort food and &lt;a 
href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/home/F_Holiday_Dinner_in_Space.html"
 target="_blank"&gt;holiday meals&lt;/a&gt; on recent missions, and has 
conducted research on astronauts' preference for &lt;a 
href="https://www.eater.com/2015/9/17/9338665/space-food-nasa-astronauts-mars"
 target="_blank"&gt;communal versus solo dining&lt;/a&gt;, as well as 
whether they benefit from cooking food themselves. Other researchers are
 exploring how space dining can fulfill astronauts' emotional needs, and
 also how to counteract phenomenon specific to space travel, &lt;a 
href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/space-food/overview/" 
target="_blank"&gt;such as the loss of the sense of 
smell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"At the end of the day, we're not worried 
about the muscle cells," NASA nutritionist Scott Smith told &lt;a 
href="https://www.eater.com/2015/9/17/9338665/space-food-nasa-astronauts-mars"
 target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eater&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "We're worried

 a collection of reports and instances that tell only one side of our

from being pushed to the fringes, cosmopolitanism and the ethics of 
diversity may be enjoying a heyday according to Pew Research Center data
 from 11 emerging countries.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">Does diversity improve lives?</h3>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;The center surveyed more than 28,000 
peoples across Columbia, India, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Tunisia,
 Venezuela, Vietnam, South African, and the Philippines on their 
opinions of diversity within their borders. These countries were chosen 
based on their middle-income status, differing degrees of technology 
ownership, and high levels of migration (internal or 
external).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey asked respondents how they 
viewed increasing numbers of other races, religions, and nationalities 
and what effect that had on the quality of life in their countries. 
Additional questions were tailored to a country's unique demographics 
and circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, respondents in the 
Philippines were asked how favorably they viewed Muslims and Christians,
 while Tunisians were asked about Sunnis and Shiites. Others, such as 
Mexico and Lebanon, were asked about asylum seekers fleeing to their 
countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pew found that "[a]cross the 11 countries 
surveyed, more said their countries are better off thanks to the 
increasing number of people of different races, ethnic groups, and 
nationalities who live there." A minority said the increase made no 
difference, and an even smaller minority said their country was worse 
off.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

relationship with diversity in their borders.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt; When looking at results from individual 
countries, the picture becomes much more nuanced. A majority of 
respondents from India, Columbia, the Philippines, Kenya, and Venezuela 
agreed with the statement that &lt;a 
href="https://bigthink.com/amway/what-are-the-benefits-of-diversity-in-the-workplace"
 target="_blank"&gt;increased diversity made their countries better 
places&lt;/a&gt; to live. Conversely, a minority agreed with the same 
statement in Tunisia, Mexico, Jordan, and Lebanon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
The reasons for these divergences seem to stem not only from deep 
historical divides but also current events. Lebanon, which held the most
 negative views of diversity among the eleven, took in an estimated 
&lt;a 
href="http://reporting.unhcr.org/node/2520#:~:text=Lebanon%20hosts%20the%20largest%20number,Palestinian%20refugees%20under%20UNRWA's%20mandate."
 target="_blank"&gt;1.5 million Syrian refugees&lt;/a&gt;, a massive 
influx for a country of around 7 million. Jordan too saw a massive wave 
of asylum seekers from the civil war; likewise, its respondents held 
that increasing numbers of different peoples made life in their country 
worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico has also seen a &lt;a 
href="https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/venezuelan-refugee" 
target="_blank"&gt;surge of asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt; from Central 
American countries, yet its overall view wasn't as unfavorable as either
 Jordan or Lebanon. However, it was the only country in the set to have a
 majority hold that increasing ethnic and religious diversity made no 
difference to the quality of life. And about half those surveyed did 
hold negative views toward refugees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;

 has strained relations, it's not the whole story that refugees and 
migrants generate negativity toward others. Views differ widely. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kenya, for example, maintains large refugee camps 
housing asylum seekers from Somalia and South Sudan, yet half of the 
country's respondents believed this multicultural status improved life 
in their country. And a majority held approving opinions of refugees. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, about half of respondents from Venezuela,
 Vietnam, and Jordan rated migrant and refugee groups favorably. Yes, 
Jordan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though a majority of Jordanians believe 
increasingly diverse peoples make their country worse, they nonetheless 
hold agreeable views of refugees. The researchers speculate this 
divergence may stem from the fact that Jordan hosts two large refugee 
groups—recent Syrian refugees and Palestinian refugees who have been in 
the country since the conflicts of the mid-20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 
century. They found that Jordanians who self-identified as Palestinians 
viewed refugees more favorably. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So,
 what leads to improved views of multiculturalism? According to Pew's 
data, those with the most positive views on racial, ethnic, and 
religious diversity were those who interacted most with these groups. 
More contact equaled more positive views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all of 
the countries, younger adults were more likely to interact with people 
of different backgrounds, and except for Jordan, they also held more 
favorable views of others. The same held true for those who attained 
higher levels of education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data mirrors another
 Pew survey in which researchers asked Americans their views on 
increased racial and ethnic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 58 
percent of Americans said increasing numbers of diverse people would 
make the United States a better place to live. Only 9 percent said it 
would make the country worse, while 31 percent said it didn't make a 
difference. Opinions were split along partisan lines, with more 
Democrats viewing the statement favorably than Republicans. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like the 11 emerging countries, Americans varied 
by age and education, too. Fifteen percent of respondents 65 and older 
believed growing multiculturalism made the U.S. worse—the highest of any
 age group. And 70 percent of college graduates saw diversity in a 
positive light, compared to 45 percent of those with a high school 
diploma or less school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey's complete results 
can be found &lt;a

attitudes on diversity is &lt;a

<h3 class="rm-manual">A future toward acceptance</h3>
<p class="rm-manual">&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that the world hasn't 
succumbed to a &lt;a 
href="https://bigthink.com/videos/tribalism-politics" 
target="_blank"&gt;new era of tribalism&lt;/a&gt; and hate. Far from it.
 The beliefs of cosmopolitanism and ethics of diversity are, in fact, 
spreading across many of the world's emerging countries and will likely 
increase as &lt;a 
href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/15/668106376/generation-z-is-the-most-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-yet"
 target="_blank"&gt;subsequent generations&lt;/a&gt; become more 
educated and integrated. That progress may be uneven, but it's real and 
measurable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An appreciation of, even desire for, 
diversity won't end the tragic events that generate eye-catching 
headlines, but it can make our shared futures more manageable. As Kwame 
Anthony Apiah wrote in his book "Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of 
Strangers": "I am urging that we should learn about people in other 
places, take an interest in their civilizations, their arguments, their 
errors, their achievements, not because that will bring us to agreement,
 but because it will help us get used to one another."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
