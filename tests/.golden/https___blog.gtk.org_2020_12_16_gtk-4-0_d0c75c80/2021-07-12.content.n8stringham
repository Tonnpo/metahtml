<p>2020 has been a very long year. What better way to end it than with a major release! Today, we released GTK 4.0.</p>
<p>GTK 4.0 is the result of a lot of hard work by a small team of 
dedicated developers. We will have a separate post to go over the 
statistics, but the short summary is that since the 3.89.1 release in 
November 2016, we’ve added over 18000 commits and made more than 20 
development releases.</p>
<p>Congratulations and a big thank you to everybody who has participated
 in this effort, and in particular to Benjamin, Emmanuele, Timm, Carlos,
 Jonas and Christian!</p>
<h3>What’s new</h3>
<p>It is impossible to summarize 4 years of development in a single 
post. We’ve written detailed articles about many of the new things in 
this release over the past year: <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2020/01/29/data-transfer-in-gtk4/">Data transfers</a>, <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2020/04/29/custom-widgets-in-gtk-4-input/">Event controllers</a>, <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2020/04/27/custom-widgets-in-gtk-4-layout/">Layout managers</a>, <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2020/04/24/custom-widgets-in-gtk-4-drawing/">Render nodes</a>, <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2020/05/20/media-in-gtk-4/">Media playback</a>, <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2020/06/07/scalable-lists-in-gtk-4/">Scalable lists</a>, <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2020/09/30/gtk-3-99-2/">Shaders</a>, <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2020/10/21/accessibility-in-gtk-4/">Accessibility</a>.

<h3>What’s old</h3>
<p>GTK 4 is now stable, and we consider it ready for consumption. That 
does not mean GTK 3 is dead – we will continue to support and update it 
for the foreseeable future (the latest release, 3.24.24, quietly went 
out a few days ago). It does mean, however, that GTK 2 has reached the 
end of its life. We will do one final 2.x release in the coming days, 
and we encourage everybody to port their GTK 2 applications to GTK 3 or 
4.</p>
<h3>How to get it</h3>
<p>The source tarballs are available in the usual <a href="https://download.gnome.org/sources/gtk/4.0">place</a>. Binary packages should appear in major distributions soon.</p>
<p>The GNOME 40 release will have a number of applications ported to GTK
 4. If you want to try GTK 4.0 today, you can use the nightly flatpak 
builds of <a href="https://nightly.gnome.org/repo/appstream/org.gtk.Demo4.flatpakref">gtk4-demo</a> and <a href="https://nightly.gnome.org/repo/appstream/org.gtk.WidgetFactory4.flatpakref">gtk4-widget-factory</a>:</p>
<pre>$ flatpak install https://nightly.gnome.org/repo/appstream/org.gtk.Demo4.flatpakref $ flatpak run org.gtk.Demo4</pre>
<p>If you are itching to port your application to GTK 4, our migration guide is <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk4/3.99/migrating.html">available</a> as part of the <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk4/3.99/">documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>How to support GTK</h3>
<p>GTK could not be developed without the many volunteers who contribute
 bug reports, patches, translations or ideas. Thanks to all of you. We 
are also grateful to the GNOME foundation for supporting GTK with 
development resources, infrastructure, and travel assistance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gnome.org/support-gnome/">Donating</a> to the GNOME foundation is a good way to support future GTK development.</p>
<h3>What comes next</h3>
<p>We are very thankful for all the early testers that have provided us 
with bug reports and feedback, which made this release much better. But 
we fully expect that there will be a quick 4.0.1 release to fix up the 
oversights and gotchas that only come to light after a .0 release.</p>
<p>Now that we have a 4.0 release, we need to bring along the library 
ecosystem to enable applications to use it. vte, webkit and 
gtksourceview are some of the most notable libraries that tend to be 
used together with GTK. We expect GTK 4 ports of these to be available 
soon.</p>
<p>If more serious issues show up, we will do a 4.2 release in time for 
GNOME 40, otherwise we might wait until the summer for that.</p>
<p>What the future will bring beyond GTK 4 remains to be seen. We have 
some fun things in the pipeline, but we would also like to hear what 
features application developers would like to see in GTK. Tell us!</p>
<h3>A celebration</h3>
<p>We will celebrate the 4.0 release with an (online) <a href="https://events.gnome.org/event/59/">gathering</a> this coming Friday. Feel free to drop by!</p>
