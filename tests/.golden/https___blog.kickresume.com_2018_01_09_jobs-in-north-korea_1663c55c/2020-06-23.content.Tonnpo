<p>North Korea: the land of Kim Jong Un, nuclear weapons, military 
parades, and endless lists of bizzare facts. But have you ever 
considered what do people do everyday? In other words, what are people’s
 jobs in North Korea?</p>
<p>We’ve put together a list of what seems like the only 10 viable jobs 
in North Korea. Keep reading to find out more what does it take to get a
 job in the communist utopia.</p>
<h2>1. Military</h2>
<p><span>Military Parades happen regularly to celebrate the country’s various holidays. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/11921692/North-Koreas-military-parades-in-60-seconds.html">The Telegraph</a>.</span></p>
<p>If you join the army, you’ll have one of the most highly regarded 
jobs in North Korea. It’s estimated the government spends around <a href="http://emgn.com/entertainment/16-seriously-scary-facts-north-korean-military/">30% of the country’s budget</a> on military despite its ongoing difficulties to fund healthcare or rural development.</p>
<p>You’ll have a chance to become part of the largest military in the world, with <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/11-bizarre-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-north-korea-a6789761.html">7.7 million</a> servicemen and servicewomen. There are <a href="http://emgn.com/entertainment/16-seriously-scary-facts-north-korean-military/">47.8 active duty military</a> members for every 1000 citizens, which is ten times higher than the US.</p>
<p>Beware, you’ll have to undergo a demanding training, which is 
mandatory for all men and women in North Korea. Every man has to serve a
 ten-year term when he turns 18 years old.</p>
<p>These are some of the military jobs in North Korea:</p>
<ol> <li>Cyber Warfare specialist. Your job would include hacking South 
Korean banks, governmental organizations as well as the president’s 
office.</li> <li>Member of the submarine fleet, serving on one of the 75 submarines (the US has only 70 submarines).</li> <li>Missile launch officer. Be ready to deal with Kim Jong Un’s temper tantrums.</li> <li>Special forces. You would take part in activities such as digging tunnels to South Korea.</li> </ol>

<h2>2. Traffic security officers</h2>
<p><span>More than 300 women direct traffic in the streets of Pyongyang. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4602298/Driven-distraction-Pyongyangs-traffic-ladies.html">Dailymail</a>.</span></p>
<p>One of the most coveted jobs in North Korea involves working as a human traffic light in the streets of Pyongyang.</p>
<p>If you want to become one of Pyongyang’s 300 “traffic ladies”, 
officially known as traffic security officers, you’ll have to meet the 
following requirements:</p>
<ul> <li>Single,</li> <li>Under 26 years old,</li> <li>Attractive looks,</li> <li>Undergo demanding training where you’ll master elegant moves and improve your endurance.</li> </ul>
<p>You’ll work in a blue uniform which consists of a knee-length pencil 
skirt, blue fitted military-style jacket with a belt, white socks in 
heels, a distinct high-peaked hat, and white gloves. In winter, your 
uniform will be embellished by fur complements and a thick hat.</p>
<p>Job description:</p>
<ul> <li>Direct traffic with the use of orange halters and a whistle,</li> <li>Act in place of traffic lights,</li> <li>Represent the nation’s capital,</li> <li>Pose for tourist photos,</li> <li>Collaborate with a team of 400 male colleagues stationed at roundabouts.</li> </ul>

<h2>3. Farmer</h2>
<p><span>As a farmer in North Korea, you’ll have access to limited 
number of machinery. Most of the work is done by hand. Image courtesy of
 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/15/north-korea-farmers-pressure-feed-nation-kim-jong-un">The Guardian</a>.</span></p>
<p>If you’re not a fan of busy city life, get a job in the rural parts 
of North Korea and enjoy the misery of staying outdoors all day.</p>
<p>The monthly income is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/23/life-in-north-korea-the-adult-years">$1-$2 a month</a>.
 However, you’ll be able to enjoy the recently introduced benefit of 
keeping a share of your crops before handing over the majority of it to 
the state.</p>
<p>Your tasks will include:</p>
<ul> <li>Feeding the hungry nation,</li> <li>Giving a substantial share of your crops to the state,</li> <li>Tending to cows, pigs, and goats,</li> <li>Working the land with oxen,</li> <li>Contributing to the production of cereal rations on which 16 out of 25 million people rely.</li> </ul>
<h2>4. Music teacher</h2>
<p><span>Unofficial sources say, there’s at least 1.2 accordions per capita in North Korea. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2118961/The-North-Korean-accordion-band-unlikely-stars-version-A-Take-On-Me.html">Dailymail</a>.</span></p>
<p>As a music teacher, you’ll never lack work in North Korea, especially when it comes to accordions.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, all teachers had to learn the accordion. Many say this requirement remains to this day.</p>
<p>Accordions are often called “the people’s instrument”. If you can’t 
quite imagine anyone being this crazy about accordions, check out this 
North Korean take on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBgMeunuviE">A-Ha’s Take On Me. </a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that as a music teacher you’d be required to make your 
students truly master their instrument. For a reference of the students’
 abilities, here’s a video of North Korean children <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSedE5sU3uc">mastering the guitar</a>. Creepy or cute?</p>
<h2>5. Tour Guide</h2>
<p><span>One of your responsibilities as a tour guide would be bringing 
all tourist to bow to the dear leaders’ monument at the Mansu Hill. 
Image courtesy of <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/north-korea-tourist-protocol/index.html?gallery=0">CNN</a>.</span></p>
<p>Being a tour guide is one of the jobs in North Korea that require most responsibility.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, tourism has been on the rise in North Korea. It’s estimated, that every year, around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/22/you-would-have-to-be-a-lunatic-tourists-to-north-korea-describe-risks-and-rewards">6,000 Western tourists</a> visit the secretive country.</p>
<p>Still, tourists aren’t allowed to explore the coutnry on their own. They’re forced to rely on a tour guide.</p>
<p>As a tour guide, you’d essentially be the keyholder. It’d be your 
responsibility to watch every move the foreign visitors make and show 
them the country in the best possible light.</p>
<p>You’d have the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul> <li>Ensuring tourists don’t take any photos of the military or pictures reflecting poverty,</li> <li>Sticking to the designated routes,</li> <li>Making sure no tourists leave their hotel unescorted,</li> <li>Admire the dear leaders and all their accomplishments during the tours,</li> <li>Ensure that tourists bow to the statues and the bodies of former leaders Kim Il Sung ad Kim Jong Il.</li> </ul>
<h2>6. Tailor</h2>
<p><span>Vynalon is the main material used by tailors across North 
Korea. This uncomfortable material is considered the national fibre of 
North Korea. Image courtesy of <a href="http://ericlafforgue.com/wp-content/uploads/fashionnk.pdf">Eric Lafforgue</a>.</span></p>
<p>If you’re looking for a job in the fashion industry, get ready to get busy.</p>
<p>Between 2016 and 2017, North Korea exported <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2107584/clothing-becomes-north-koreas-main-export-china-after">$166.82 million</a> worth of men’s waterproof jackets alone.</p>
<p>North Korea exports a lot of clothes, but at the same time they’re 
always looking for local fashion designers to design clothes that comply
 with the state regulations.</p>
<p>If you were to design clothes for casual wear in North Korea, you’d have to follow these job guidelines:</p>
<ol> <li>Eliminate any influence of Western fashion such as short skirts, design brands, bright colors, or indecent patterns.</li> <li>Your
 main material will be vynalon. A stiff, synthetic fiber created in 
North Korea in the 195o’s. This material is used for both uniforms and 
casual clothes.</li> <li>Remember, no denim is allowed, as jeans represent the capitalist USA.</li> </ol>
<p><span>Uniforms are everywhere. From young pioneers, through students,
 to military servicemen and servicewomen. As a tailor you’d never be 
short of job opportunitites. Image courtesy of <a href="http://thechinatimes.com/online/2012/06/3751.html">The China Times</a>.</span></p>
<p>Tailors have one of the most useful jobs in North Korea. Especially, 
when you consider the number of uniforms that has to be made every year.</p>
<p>People in North Korea wear uniforms regardless of their age and 
gender. Children wear pioneer uniforms, students wear school uniforms, 
and understandably, the military requires thousands of uniforms for its 
members.</p>
<h2>7. Hairdresser</h2>
<p><span>Married women must keep their hair short, while single ladies are allowed longer hair. Image courtesy of <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/02/25/these-are-north-koreas-28-state-approved-hairstyles/">Time</a>.</span></p>
<p>As a hairdresser in North Korea, your creativity would be somewhat 
limited. You would be required to have a perfect knowledge of the <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/02/25/these-are-north-koreas-28-state-approved-hairstyles/">28 state-approved hairstyles</a>.</p>
<p>Allegedly, only 18 hairstyles for women and 10 for men are allowed in North Korea.</p>
<p>Here’s a few basic rules you’d have to learn before the interview:</p>
<p>Single ladies are allowed to keep their hair longer, while married women must cut their hair short.</p>
<p>As for men, they have to keep their hair no longer than 2 inches. Older men, however, can get away with 3 inches.</p>
<p>As a hairdresser, don’t even think about copying the leader’s look. 
Kim Jong Un has put a trademark on his side-shaved swept-back style.</p>
<p><span>The iconic hairstyle of Kim Jon Un is not on the list of hairstyles the state allows peope to wear. Image courtesy of <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/04/18/kim-jong-un-wont-let-anyone-else-in-north-korea-get-his-haircut/">New York Post</a>.</span></p>
<h2>8. Sculptor</h2>
<p><span>As a sculptor, you’ll have three options as to Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/north-korea/galleries/what-you-didn-t-know-about-north-korea/but-there-are-34-000-kim-il-sung-statues/">Telegraph</a>.</span></p>
<p>Overall, this is a boring job. You’ll have a multiple options as to 
what statues to create. Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il or Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you would never run out of job opportunities. There’s <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/north-korea/galleries/what-you-didn-t-know-about-north-korea/but-there-are-34-000-kim-il-sung-statues/">34,000 statues</a> of Kim Il Sung, the country’s founder, making it one for every 750 citizens.</p>
<p>If you want your artworks to be treated with respect, then becoming a
 sculptor in North Korea might be the perfect job for you! Everyone who 
passes the leaders’ monuments has to bow three times to the statues.</p>
<p>On top of that, when a tourist wants to take a photo of these 
statues, they have to fit the entirety of the statue in the picture. 
Otherwise, you risk punishment for accidentally cropping of Kim Jong 
Il’s feet from your photo.</p>
<h2>9. Academia</h2>
<p><span>As a university lecturer, you’d not only have to play the 
accordion, but also teach zumba to university students. Image courtesy 
of<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-25945931"> BBC</a>.</span></p>
<p>Current job openings:</p>
<ul> <li>Lecturer of North Korean patriotism at the western-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology;</li> <li>Accordion teacher at the Hamhŭng University of Education;</li> <li>Lecturer in Surveillance Technologies at the Huichon University of Telecommunications;</li> <li>Conductor at the National Accordion Ensemble at the Pyongyang University of Music and Dance.</li> </ul>
<p>If you’re looking to dive into academic research in North Korea, get ready for the following restrictions:</p>
<ul> <li>You’ll have to make do with limited resources.</li> <li>No international research teams. North Korean academics will be your only colleagues.</li> <li>All academic articles have to be submitted to North Korean journals.</li> <li>Academic articles (both humanities and sciences) have to include at least one quote from a member of the Kim family.</li> </ul>
<h2>10. Kim’s PR</h2>
<p><span>Working on the PR of the Kim’s dynasty may well be the most important job in the country. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2276819/North-Korea-gives-statue-leader-Kim-Jong-il-bizarre-makeover--removing-jacket-replacing-giant-bronze-anorak.html">Dailymail</a>.</span></p>
<p>If you’re looking for a truly creative job in North Korea, or perhaps
 have some previous experience with PR, marketing, or even fiction 
writing, this might well be your dream job!</p>
<p>Your job would be to constantly work to improve Kim’s personal brand 
and support the strong standing of the past and present leaders of the 
country. As a PR officer, you have to present the Kim dynasty as 
almighty superhumans.</p>
<p>Your tasks, should you get the job, would include:</p>
<ul> <li>Cover up for Kim Jong Un’s failing results from his school 
years in Switzerland. He is known to have been particularly bad at maths
 and sciences.</li> <li>Disclaim any rumors about Kim Jong Un’s <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1317958/Has-Kim-Jong-Un-plastic-surgery-look-like-grandfather-Kim-Il-Sung.html">plastic surgery</a> that he allegedly got to resemble his grandfather Kim Il Sung.</li> <li>Inform
 the world about Kim Jong Il’s unprecedented achievements: “Amazing 
news! Kim Jong Il learns to walk when 3 weeks old and uttered his first 
words just 8 weeks after being born”.</li> <li>Spread the word about the leader’s superhuman capabilities: “Kim Jong Un <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/11921692/North-Koreas-military-parades-in-60-seconds.html">drives</a> at the age of three”.</li> <li>Ensure that all schoolbooks teach kids that Kim Jong Il invented the ‘double bread with meat’ (a.k.a. sandwich).</li> <li>Further support the state propaganda with claims that Kim Jong Il<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/photos/15-strange-facts-about-the-kim-dynasty/ss-AAbtV33#image=8"> never used the toilet</a>, as he doesn’t need to defecate.</li> <li>Perpetuate the myth that Kim Jong Il could <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/photos/15-strange-facts-about-the-kim-dynasty/ss-AAbtV33#image=9">control the weather</a> with his mood.</li> <li>Work
 on texts for schools, such as “Kim Jong Un’s Revolutionary Activities”,
 which teaches kids essential life facts, such as the leader’s victory 
at a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/photos/15-strange-facts-about-the-kim-dynasty/ss-AAbtV33#image=15">yachting race</a> at the age of 9.</li> </ul>
