<p>Remote sensing has revolutionized how we measure and understand the Earth. We can now <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/?analysis=eyJzaG93QW5hbHlzaXMiOnRydWUsImhpZGRlbiI6ZmFsc2V9&amp;map=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&amp;menu=eyJtZW51U2VjdGlvbiI6IiIsImRhdGFzZXRDYXRlZ29yeSI6IiJ9">track deforestation across the globe</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12369494/descartes-artificial-intelligence-crop-predictions-usda">predict end-of-season crop yields</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/tech/ai-wildfires/index.html">identify wildfires in near real-time</a>. But exploration into its possibilities for urban areas has only just begun. <a href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/maps-tools-and-publications/satellite-imagery-and-air-photos/remote-sensing-tutorials/land-cover-land-use/9373">Conventional land cover maps</a>,
 which categorize the surface of the Earth into groupings like “forest” 
or “water” or “tundra,” often lump urban areas into a single category, 
like “urban” or “built-up.” This is useful for mapping urban extent 
generally, but does not capture the complexity of urban areas. Mapping 
land use, however, can reveal the patterns of a city, from road networks
 to housing availability to the distribution of commercial and 
industrial space — along with the jobs they represent — and much more.</p>
<p>Mapping urban land use over time can show what, where and when 
changes are happening: where the city is expanding or contracting; what 
patterns and densities characterize areas of growth or redevelopment; 
and which types of land use are being displaced. This information, for 
example, can highlight spatial inequality and other key issues for 
cities. Has housing kept pace with the population? Has infrastructure 
kept pace with development, and if not, where is it needed? Is growth 
encroaching on wetlands or farmlands that are critical to the city’s 
well-being? Pressing questions like these abound for urban planners, 
officials and residents. Robust land use data can help provide the 
answers.</p>
<p>Close-up view of WRI’s six-category urban land use and road maps for northeast Monterrey urban area, Mexico.</p>
<p>WRI, with support from the National Geographic Society, has developed methods and infrastructure to <a href="https://www.wri.org/publication/mapping-urban-land-use-in-india-and-mexico">map urban land use in any city</a>,
 providing a new tool to help cities manage their resources and improve 
quality of life. The results for cities in two countries, Mexico and 
India, illustrate what makes these new urban land use maps novel and how
 they can benefit cities.</p>
<h1>Mapping Patterns of Life</h1>
<p>More than half of the world’s population now lives in cities, but 
there’s still a lot we don’t know about urban areas. This is especially 
true for rapidly growing cities in emerging economies, where expansion 
and redevelopment often outpace administrative capacity. From the city 
scale to the neighborhood scale, there is little rigorous, 
globally-consistent data on how cities are arranged, how they grow and 
change and how to improve them for the well-being of urban residents and
 the planet.</p>
<p>Detailed, global maps of land use within cities have, to date, simply not existed. <a href="https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover">Many</a> <a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod12.php">existing</a> <a href="https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/">products</a>
 show land cover at the continental or global scale and are spatially 
coarse. Other, true land use remote products are based on expensive, 
relatively scarce high-resolution satellite imagery, and are thus 
limited to individual cities or even districts. Other land use maps are 
created by city planners through detailed, on-the-ground data collection
 to develop <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/v4860e/v4860e03.htm">cadasters</a>.</p>
<p>To address this information gap, we used data from the <a href="http://www.atlasofurbanexpansion.org/">Atlas of Urban Expansion</a>, remote sensing imagery, machine learning techniques and cloud computing tools — including Python libraries, Keras and the <a href="https://www.descarteslabs.com/">Descartes Labs Platform</a> — to create computer vision models to categorize and map land use.</p>
<p>Our new urban mapping system is different: the resulting maps feature
 a detailed taxonomy of land use drawn at 5-meter resolution and require
 only medium-resolution satellite imagery, which is publicly available 
for the Earth’s entire surface and is constantly updated.</p>
<p>Thanks to the imagery archives of ESA’s Sentinel and NASA’s Landsat 
satellite constellations, we can retroactively map urban land use going 
back years. And because each data set captures the full globe at least a
 couple of times per month, our methodology can continually be applied 
to new imagery, creating an up-to-date and ever-richer dataset that can 
provide insights about how cities around the world are growing and 
changing. The outputs are <a href="https://www.wri.org/publication/mapping-urban-land-use-in-india-and-mexico">publicly available</a> so urban planners and other practitioners can start using them in research and to inform decisions immediately.</p>
<h1>Insights from Hyderabad and Mexico City</h1>
<p>Using these models, we mapped land use across multiple cities in 
Mexico and India, two rapidly urbanizing countries with major 
differences in their urban land use and development history. Despite 
having some of the largest cities globally, India is still mostly rural,
 with only <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;series=SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS&amp;country=IND">34%</a> of its population living in urban areas. In contrast, <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;series=SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS&amp;country=MEX">80%</a> of Mexico’s population is considered urban.</p>
<p>Side-by-side comparisons of WRI’s land use maps (5 m spatial 
resolution) and the ESA CCI land cover maps (300 m resolution) 
illustrate the improved level of detail achieved in this new dataset. In
 the ESA land cover maps, both Hyderabad, India and Mexico City, Mexico 
look like giant blobs of “urban” across the landscape: they lack 
definition at the boundaries and offer little detail about the city’s 
interior landscape. Within the urban class, there is no information 
about areas with primarily residential versus primarily business 
activities, the location of transportation corridors or where 
infrastructure exists. All of these elements are critical to 
understanding the specific, local urbanization challenges faced by a 
city.</p>
<p>ESA CCI land cover map (left, 300 meter spatial resolution) compared 
to WRI’s urban land use map (right, 5 meter spatial resolution) for 
Mexico City, Mexico.</p>
<p>The finer-resolution maps developed through this model distinguish 
details in these “blobs,” revealing patterns and details invisible at 
coarser scales. For example, the largest non-residential regions in 
Mexico City are in the northern portion of the metropolitan area, where 
industrial uses and warehouses are common. Housing types that serve 
low-income people (informal, atomistic and residential projects) are 
also common near these non-residential districts in the north, as well 
as along the city’s periphery. Formal housing is predominant in the city
 center and south. The <a href="https://thecityfix.com/blog/watch-urban-growth-unfold-amazing-visualizations-cities-worldwide-accra-mexico-city-nairobi-istanbul-sustaianble-development-sprawl-coby-joseph/">(in)famous sprawl of the Mexico City metropolitan area</a>
 and the relative spatial segregation of land uses contributes to long 
commutes, especially for those living at the periphery, and is a 
significant contributor to the capital’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/16/scary-images-mexico-citys-pollution-emergency/">well-documented air pollution</a>.</p>
<p>By contrast, concentrations of non-residential areas in Hyderabad are
 largely found on the periphery, many of which represent the information
 technology office parks that proliferated at the city’s edge over the 
past few decades. This also meant significant <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/10/21/india-urbanization-report-beyond-sustainable-cities">employment and housing growth in suburban areas</a>, which has <a href="https://www.wri.org/events/2019/01/upward-and-outward-growth">stressed the city’s ability to provide services</a>.</p>
<p>The pattern of informal settlements also distinctly differs between 
the two cities. In Mexico City, whose metropolitan population increased 
an average of <a href="http://atlasofurbanexpansion.org/cities/view/Mexico_City">2.5% per year</a>
 since 1990, rapid growth spawned both informal residential areas and 
“atomistic settlements” — areas that were not clearly subdivided and 
grew incrementally. These areas represent both planned developments to 
accommodate new residents (as evidenced in Chimalhuacan and surrounding 
municipalities, the large area of “informal subdivisions” in the 
southeast) and unplanned growth when housing efforts did not keep pace 
or meet residential needs (often atomistic settlements found primarily 
along the urban periphery and into the foothills of the mountains that 
surround the Valle de México). Many of these areas lack the basic 
infrastructure that other settlement areas enjoy, such as reliable 
water, sanitation, electricity and public transportation. People living 
in these areas also have more <a href="https://thecityfix.com/blog/map-month-mobility-health-education-inequality-mexico-city-spatial-problem-mauricio-brito-lorelei-ramirez-reyes-jorge-macias-eric-mackres/">difficulty accessing critical urban services</a>
 like jobs, education, food, recreation and health care. Traditional 
land cover maps do not reflect these distinctions in land use type, or 
the associated characteristics and problems.</p>
<p>Hyderabad is different: its unplanned settlements, many of which are 
long established, are distributed throughout the core of the city, along
 the periphery and in surrounding villages. The informal residential 
areas and non-residential areas that dot the region surrounding the city
 are typical of many South and Southeast Asian cities. These “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desakota">desakota</a>”
 regions have urban characteristics but are also highly reliant on 
agriculture. Many of these areas are already subsumed by the growing 
city, transformed into “urban villages,” with more areas likely to 
follow as the city grows, creating an even more sprawling megacity. As 
these unconnected dots grow into the more consolidated and contiguous 
city, monitoring land use change offers the opportunity to anticipate 
and manage these challenges.</p>

<h1>Implications</h1>
<p>There are numerous ways that fine-grained land use maps like these 
can be utilized, as researchers can compare patterns within cities and 
differences from city to city and country to country. These land use 
data can combine with other datasets — such as data on the 
socioeconomics of households, amenities and services, land values, 
economic activity, hazards and vulnerabilities — to derive new insights.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, policymakers, civil society and the private 
sector can make changes on the ground to improve peoples’ lives, 
including enabling better targeting of scarce resources based on 
evidence. And over time, these data can be used to measure the 
effectiveness of the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">U.N. Sustainable Development Goals</a> and other development metrics.</p>
<p>We continue to develop and improve our methodology and aim, pending 
necessary resources, to ultimately produce equivalent maps for every 
city in the world every year. With high-fidelity land use data like 
these, researchers can better understand how urban areas develop over 
time, how land use changes along the urban periphery and which types of 
settlements are most affected by natural disasters such as flooding or 
landslides. These are just a few possible applications, but the 
potential for these data are even greater — and can only be fully 
realized by putting these maps and methods in the hands of users.</p>
