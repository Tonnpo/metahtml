<p class="rm-manual"> ‘Incredible’ GPU cluster powers AI development for Autopilot and full self-driving. </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span>June 22, 2021</span> <span>by</span> <span><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/author/danny-shapiro/">Danny Shapiro</a></span> </p>
<p>Tackling one of the largest computing challenges of this lifetime requires larger than life computing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOL_rCK59ZI&amp;t=29533s">At CVPR this week</a>,
 Andrej Karpathy, senior director of AI at Tesla, unveiled the in-house 
supercomputer the automaker is using to train deep neural networks for 
Autopilot and self-driving capabilities. The cluster uses 720 nodes of 
8x <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs</a> (5,760 GPUs total) to achieve an industry-leading 1.8 exaflops of performance.</p>
<p>“This is a really incredible supercomputer,” Karpathy said. “I 
actually believe that in terms of flops, this is roughly the No. 5 
supercomputer in the world.”</p>
<p>With unprecedented levels of compute for the automotive industry at 
the center of its development cycle, Tesla is making it possible for 
autonomous vehicle engineers to do their life’s work efficiently and at 
the cutting edge.</p>
<p>NVIDIA A100 GPUs deliver acceleration at every scale to power the 
world’s highest-performing data centers. Powered by the NVIDIA Ampere 
Architecture, the A100 GPU provides up to 20x higher performance over 
the prior generation and can be partitioned into seven GPU instances to 
dynamically adjust to shifting demands.</p>
<p>The GPU cluster is part of Tesla’s vertically integrated autonomous 
driving approach, which uses more than 1 million cars already driving on
 the road to refine and build new features for continuous improvement.</p>
<h2>From the Car to the Data Center</h2>
<p>Tesla’s cyclical development begins in the car. A deep neural network
 running in “shadow mode” quietly perceives and makes predictions while 
the car is driving without actually controlling the vehicle.</p>
<p>These predictions are recorded, and any mistakes or 
misidentifications are logged. Tesla engineers then use these instances 
to create a training dataset of difficult and diverse scenarios to 
refine the DNN.</p>
<p>The result is a collection of roughly 1 million 10-second clips 
recorded at 36 frames per second, totaling a whopping 1.5 petabytes of 
data. The DNN is then run through these scenarios in the data center 
over and over until it operates without a mistake. Finally, it’s sent 
back to the vehicle and begins the process again.</p>
<p>Karpathy said training a DNN in this manner and on such a large 
amount of data requires “a huge amount of compute,” which led Tesla to 
build and deploy the current generation supercomputer with 
high-performance A100 GPUs.</p>
<h2>Continuous Iteration</h2>
<p>In addition to comprehensive training, Tesla’s supercomputer gives 
autonomous vehicle engineers the performance needed to experiment and 
iterate in the development process.</p>
<p>Karpathy said the current DNN structure the automaker is deploying 
allows a team of 20 engineers to work on a single network at once, 
isolating different features for parallel development.</p>
<p>These DNNs can then be run through training datasets at speeds faster
 than what has been previously possible for rapid iteration.</p>
<p>“Computer vision is the bread and butter of what we do and enables 
Autopilot. For that to work, you need to train a massive neural network 
and experiment a lot,” Karpathy said. “That’s why we’ve invested a lot 
into the compute.”</p>
