<p class="rm-manual"> By <a rel="author" href="https://blogs.psychcentral.com/psychoanalysis-now/author/geralds/"><span><span>Gerald Schoenewolf, Ph.D.</span></span></a> </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Last updated: <span>5 Mar 2017</span> </p>
<p class="rm-manual">~ 4 min read</p>
<p> The recent assassination of Kim Jong Un’s older half-brother, Kim 
Jong Nam, was apparently the latest extermination by Kim Jong Un. </p>
<p>Besides exterminating people, Kim Jong Un also likes basketball and 
H-bombs. Un, who is the leader of North Korea, doesn’t mind killing a 
few people now and then who don’t agree with him, but he also likes to 
play with and watch the game with the round ball, and he even invited 
some American NBA players, organized by former NBA great, Dennis Rodman,
 to visit North Korea and stage a game for his pleasure and some of the 
North Korean inner circle.</p>
<p>Killing people and watching the NBA; that is what apparently gives him the most joy. In addition to his older brother, he has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un" rel="noopener nofollow">exterminated</a>
 whole families and generals who disagree with him since coming to 
power. In December 2013, Kim Jong-un’s Uncle Jang Sung-taek was arrested
 and executed for treachery. Jang Sung-taek is believed to have been 
executed by firing squad. According to multiple unnamed sources, Kim 
Jong-un has also put to death members of Jang’s family, to completely 
destroy all traces of Jang’s existence through the extermination of his 
family, including the children and grandchildren of all close relatives.
 </p>
<p>Top generals were also executed. O Sang-hon was a deputy security 
minister in the Ministry of Public Security in the government of North 
Korea. He was killed during a political purge in 2014. According to the 
Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo, he was executed by flamethrower for his 
role in supporting Kim Jong-un’s uncle Jang Song-taek.</p>
<p>Most of his country is struggling to find food to eat, while he 
chuckles in his lavish mansion with an almost teenage delight when 
LeBron James makes a dunk, and Un appears at that moment to be like any 
normal young NBA fan. Only once was he reported to have taken note of 
the difference between his lifestyle and the people he rules. When he 
was 18 and living in a mansion, smoking Yves Saint Laurent cigarettes, 
swilling Johnnie Walker whisky and driving a Mercedes-Benz 600 luxury 
sedan, Jong un questioned his lavish lifestyle and asked, “We are here, 
playing basketball, riding horses, riding jet skis, having fun together.
 But what of the lives of the average people?” Apparently this was only a
 momentary concern.</p>
<p>Today Un spends much of his time, and much of North Korea’s resources
 developing H-bombs and missiles capable of carrying these H-bombs to 
the United States, the country which seems to be his most hated enemy. 
On 7 March 7, 2013, North Korea threatened the United States with a 
“pre-emptive nuclear attack”, and Kim Jong Un issued a detailed threat 
to “wipe out” Baengnyeong Island, the scene of previous naval clashes. 
North Korea has revealed plans for conducting nuclear strikes on U.S. 
cities, including Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Experts do not think 
Un and North Korea have developed the capability yet, but it is expected
 that they will soon.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Kim Jong Un is deranged. His exact diagnosis 
is difficult to make, but we can say he is probably paranoid and he is 
the number one nuclear threat in the world. His most often stated goal 
is to eradicate the United States. He is like a nuclear suicide bomber 
ready at a moment’s notice to do his work. The question is, how did he 
get that way?</p>
<p>The man who served as his<a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/variety/2014/02/23/Kim-John-Un-s-childhood-of-Big-Macs-and-pleasure-girls-revealed.html" rel="noopener nofollow"> father’s chef</a>
 and Un’s de facto nanny, Fujimoto (his Japanese name), spoke out 
recently about Kim Jong Un’s childhood. It seems that he, his older 
brother and sister, were given everything they wanted, but not the love 
that every child needs. Allowed every privilege at a young age, Fujimoto
 recalls Jong-un demanding to drive a car, a Mercedes no less, at the 
age of seven. “They put a little box beneath his feet to help him reach 
the pedals and someone gave him instruction. The first car he got was a 
Mercedes-Benz, and he has owned Mercedes ever since. I’d say he has more
 than ten now – all bulletproof.” </p>
<p>At the age of 14, Un demanded to smoke, and then to drink. “[He] 
drank a lot, too, even as a young teenager – Russia’s finest vodka. 
Sometimes he’d drink the whole bottle all by himself,” Fujimoto noted. 
Then he began spending time on one of the two yachts his father bought 
for him and became a good sailor. He also has an endless supply of 
McDonalds Big Macs, although the chain is not in North Korea.</p>
<p>In his late teens, Jong-un was exposed to his father’s ‘pleasure 
brigade’ – an endless array of beautiful teenage girls forced to sing, 
strip naked, give massages and perform sexual duties for Un’s father. 
Fujimoto claims that the 18-year-old Kim was shy with girls and hated 
“having relationships with multiple women.” His stand-offish attitude 
toward girls led his father to wonder if his son was gay. Fujimoto 
speculates that Kim hated his father’s womanizing and this is what led 
him to execute his uncle, Jang Sung Taek, who was responsible for 
picking the girls that served in the father’s pleasure brigade. I would 
speculate that his father hatred started during his early childhood and 
was fueled by his father’s ruthless attitude toward him.</p>
<p>According to many sources, Un and his older brother both attended 
private schools in Switzerland, Un going to the International School in 
Gümligen under the name “Chol-pak” or “Pak-chol” from 1993 to 1998. He 
did poorly in his studies but excelled at one sport in 
particular—basketball. He was described by classmates as a shy child who
 was awkward with girls and indifferent to political issues, but who 
distinguished himself in sports and had a fascination with the American 
National Basketball Association and Michael Jordan. One friend claimed 
that Kim had been shown pictures of himself with Kobe Bryant and Toni 
Kukoč.</p>
<p>Now Kim Jong Un has his own private basketball court where he sets up
 games with his intimates while he plans his future H-bomb attacks on 
the United States. He appears to have been a spoiled little boy who got 
everything but self-discipline and the love of his father, and he has 
now turned into a megalomaniac leader. His hatred of his father has been
 transferred to the United States, which he despises for its sexualized 
lifestyle, similar to his father’s. </p>
<p>Un has never known any limits to his behavior since his early child. 
Now the world wants to impose limits and he doesn’t like it. He just 
wants the world to give him whatever he wants, or else.</p>
