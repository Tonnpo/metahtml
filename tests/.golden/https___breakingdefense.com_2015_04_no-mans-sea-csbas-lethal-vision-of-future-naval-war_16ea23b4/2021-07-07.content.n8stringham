<p class="rm-manual">CSBA graphic of a future war at sea.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: The seas are shrinking. As <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/11/47-seconds-from-hell-a-challenge-to-navy-doctrine/">missiles grow longer-ranged and more precise</a>, as <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/01/transparent-sea-the-unstealthy-future-of-submarines/">sensors grow ever sharper</a>,
 there are ever fewer places for a ship to hide. “A ship’s a fool to 
fight a fort,” goes an old naval adage, because a land base can carry 
more ammunition and armor than anything that floats. Admirals have 
always been uneasy about bringing their fleets <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/04/marine-choppers-are-navys-cuisinart-surviving-littoral-warfare/">in range of shore-based weapons</a>. But what does the US Navy do when those weapons can find you hundreds or thousands of miles out to sea?</p>
<p>That’s the question posed by <a href="http://csbaonline.org/about/people/akrepinevich/">Andrew Krepinevich</a>
 in his forthcoming study, Maritime Competition In A Mature 
Precision-Strike Regime. (Krepinevich gave Breaking Defense an exclusive
 advance copy and answered our questions about it at length). The 
thinktank Krepinevich heads, the <a href="http://csbaonline.org/">Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments</a>, has long led the way on the concepts called <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/03/sowing-the-sea-with-fire-how-russia-china-iran-lay-mines-and-how-to-stop-them/">anti-access/area denial</a> (A2/AD) and <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2013/07/glimpse-inside-air-sea-battle-nukes-cyber-at-its-heart/">Air-Sea Battle</a>, which wrestle with the rising power of <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2013/10/chinas-fear-of-us-may-tempt-them-to-preempt-sinologists/">China</a>
 and other countries to keep US forces at a distance. His new study 
carries this earlier work to its logical conclusion: a world in which 
both sides have built the wide-area network of <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/03/us-military-losing-edge-in-space-kendall/">spy satellites</a>, <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/10/triton-poseidon-uclass-the-navys-isr-balancing-act/">drones</a>, <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2013/09/b-1b-bomber-exterminates-small-moving-boat-tests-larger-anti-ship-missile/">bombers</a>, and <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/01/growing-teeth-upgunning-the-surface-navy/">missiles</a> that is <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2012/12/the-end-of-advantage-enemies-may-catch-up-with-us-technology/">currently a US monopoly </a>— the “mature precision-strike regime” of the title.</p>
<p>It’s a world in which naval warfare is very different — indeed, in 
which land-based forces can do so much damage to fleets that the 
conflict isn’t purely “naval” anymore. (That’s why the study uses 
“maritime” instead). The World War II parallel is not Midway, where US 
and Japanese carriers struggled to find each other in the vast Pacific: 
It’s the Mediterranean, where both Axis and Allied ships were easily 
found and ravaged by land-based bombers. The difference is that modern 
technology effectively shrinks the Pacific to the size of the 
Mediterranean.</p>
<p>“In the Med [in World War II], you have these no man’s lands where it
 becomes very difficult to operate on the surface of the water,” 
Krepinevich told me. “In a mature [precision strike] regime, the oceans 
may shrink to Mediterranean size.”</p>
<p>Krepinevich foresees the anti-access/area denial zones of CSBA’s 
earlier studies expanding ever further into the ocean until they meet in
 the middle, creating a no man’s land — or rather, no man’s sea — where 
both sides venture only at grave peril. After centuries in which freedom
 of maneuver was the norm in naval operations, much of the ocean would 
be carved up into impassable killing fields. In cases where rival 
countries are close together, as <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/01/japan-re-shapes-its-national-security-strategy/">Japan</a>, <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2013/11/chinas-new-defense-zone-drives-korea-japan-together/">South Korea</a>, and <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2012/12/us-wants-out-of-pacific-islands-mess/">Taiwan</a> are to China, the Gulf emirates to Iran, or the <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/03/putin-wont-blitz-baltic-states-but-nato-has-a-plan/">Baltic States</a>
 to Russia, the entire territory of the smaller nation may be inside the
 no-go zone. This means US allies would be blockaded, under bombardment,
 and under siege from the second that the shooting started. It also 
means US forces coming to their rescue would have to cross the oceanic 
equivalent of World War I’s Western Front.</p>
<p>“If you have to reinforce Taiwan or some critical point,” said 
Krepinevich, “and you don’t have a lot of time to prepare the 
battlefield, you are confronted with the prospect of ceding that key 
interest or suffering high levels of attrition.”</p>
<p>So how do you cross the killing fields intact? Just like the 
commanders of World War I, who turned to various combinations of new 
technologies (British tanks) and tactics (German stormtroopers), 
Krepinevich looks at a range of possibilities.</p>
<p>The simplest solution is not to go in at all. Instead, blockade the 
enemy and try to force him to come out into your kill zone to break the 
siege. The tricky part, of course, is getting the enemy to cooperate. 
Such a distant blockade, keeping China’s exports from reaching buyers 
and keeping Mideast oil from reaching China, is the heart of the “<a href="http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2012-12/offshore-control-answer">Offshore Control</a>” strategy proposed by retired Marine colonel <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/tag/t-x-hammes/">T.X. Hammes</a>
 as an alternative to Air-Sea Battle. That’s an attractive option when 
you have time, Krepinevich told me. But our allies trapped inside the 
enemy’s kill zone (e.g. Japan) might not last long enough for our 
distant blockade to win the war.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we take a more aggressive course, our own ammo 
may not last long enough. Fighting a high-tech enemy would eat up 
missiles, drones, and even manned systems — with the loss of human life 
that entails — at a rate far higher than relatively defenseless targets 
in <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2012/09/us-allies-wrestle-with-intel-sharing-problems-exposed-in-libya/">Libya</a>, Afghanistan, or the <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/04/trench-warfare-with-wings-can-isil-airstrikes-go-beyond-attrition/">Islamic State</a>.
 US commanders are already lamenting their low stockpiles of precision 
weapons, and US industry can’t churn out new ones very fast.</p>
<p>“In a prospective near-term conflict with the People’s Republic of 
China, we have little ability to surge production of munitions, let 
alone <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/04/fy2016-long-range-shipbuilding-plan/">major platforms</a>,”
 Krepinevich said. “So if you are the PRC, you may only need to plan to 
maintain a few months’ supply of oil. If you are Beijing and thinking 
long-term, you can stockpile — which I understand they are — or build 
underground pipelines on land,” for example to oil-rich Russia.</p>
<p>Stockpiling oil, however, is much easier than stockpiling 
precision-guided weapons. If China and other adversaries can make us run
 out of ammo, why can’t we make them run out of theirs? In the age of 
iPhones, the technology to make missiles smart keeps getting cheaper, 
Krepinevich said, but the technology to make them long-ranged does not. 
That means even a major power will have a limited number of its most 
dangerous weapons.</p>
<p>One way of depleting the enemy arsenal is to make them shoot at nothing: decoys, <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/03/winning-the-war-of-electrons-inside-the-new-maritime-strategy/">electronic warfare</a>, and even <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/10/set-set-cyber-zebra-navy-shipboard-cybersecurity/">hacking the enemy’s network</a>
 can all create illusory targets. When the enemy does fire at something 
real, however, it would be great to be able to shoot the incoming 
missile down. That’s a problem with <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/03/raid-breaker-work-elevates-electronic-warfare-eye-on-missile-defense/">current missile defenses</a>, which rely on <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/08/non-standard-navy-sm-6-kills-cruise-missiles-deep-inland/">high-priced interceptors</a> ships can only carry in small numbers. <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/02/are-missile-defense-lasers-on-the-verge-of-reality/">Laser weapons</a> or <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/04/navys-magnetic-super-gun-to-make-mach-7-shots-at-sea-in-2016-adm-greenert/">electromagnetic rail guns</a>, however, could keep taking cheap shots until the enemy is out of expensive missiles.</p>
<p>Long-range missiles aren’t the only limited resource: So are the long-range sensors that find the targets in the first place. <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/07/us-cant-stick-our-heads-in-the-sand-over-rising-threats-to-space-gen-shelton/">Satellites are increasingly vulnerable</a>
 to both direct attack — lasers blinding their sensors, for example — 
and indirect attack — hackers compromising their downlinks to earth or 
smart bombs destroying the ground control stations. As space goes dark, 
the warring powers will probably resort to high-altitude drones for both
 reconnaissance and communications relays, Krepinevich says. But those 
drones need to be smart enough to operate with <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/10/who-pulls-trigger-for-new-navy-drone-swarm-boats/">a high level of autonomy</a>, he added, or the long-range <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2012/08/drones-need-secure-datalinks-to-survive-vs-iran-china/">data links</a> between them and their operators will become another major vulnerability to be jammed and hacked.</p>
<p>Overall, the <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/01/cyberwar-what-people-keep-missing-about-the-threat/">wireless network</a>
 connecting the far-flung enemy forces — both human and robotic — will 
be a vital target. Cyber espionage could play as vital a role as 
cracking Nazi and Japanese codes (the <a href="http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9722">ULTRA and MAGIC</a>
 projects) did in World War II. Cyber attack could also introduce false 
data or shut down key enemy systems at a critical time. But this domain 
of warfare is even more filled with uncertainties than the rest of the 
future, Krepinevich cautioned.</p>
<p>“To a certain extent, cyber to this regime is kind of like airpower 
in the ’20s and ’30s,” he said, “where everybody knew it was going to be
 important,” but they didn’t know how important or in what way.</p>
<p>With airpower, however, at least the uncertainty largely ended once 
the shooting began: You could see planes going down, the cities in 
flames. With cyber warfare and electronic deception, however, both 
attack and effects are largely invisible. If the enemy stops shooting 
long-range missiles at you, he may have run out, he may have been 
blinded by your cyber and electronic attacks — or he may be holding his 
fire for when you come closer, into his trap.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, US forces will have to come closer, if only 
because they’re running out of long-range weapons. So what kind of 
future force will best survive the 21st century no man’s land? Stealth 
will still matter, Krepinevich predicts, albeit continually challenged 
by <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/01/transparent-sea-the-unstealthy-future-of-submarines/">ever more sensitive sensors backed by big data analytics</a>. <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/03/cyber-subs-a-decisive-edge-for-high-tech-war/">Submarines</a> and <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/04/should-future-fighter-be-like-a-bomber-groundbreaking-csba-study/">land-based bombers</a> — larger and longer-ranged than any carrier aircraft — will likely form the leading edge of the force, backstopped by <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/10/army-should-build-ship-killer-missiles-rep-randy-forbes/">land-based long-range missiles</a>.</p>
<p>That said, Krepinevich hardly rules out a role for surface ships, even ones that present as big a target as an <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/03/jet-cars-radars-the-ford-class-carrier/">aircraft carrier</a>.
 While they’re more visible and vulnerable than submarines, surface 
ships also cost much less per pound of payload, potentially giving them <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/01/navy-seeks-rail-guns-lasers-cruise-missiles-to-improve-pacific-firepower/">much more firepower</a>.
 The critical question is what that payload is. Currently, he warns, 
potential adversaries have cruise missiles that can hit a US carrier 
from ranges so long the carrier’s aircraft can’t strike back. (That is, 
not without mid-air refueling, a prohibitively risky maneuver in hostile
 airspace). <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/11/expanding-the-reach-of-the-carrier-strike-group/">Longer-ranged carrier aircraft</a> — <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2015/03/mccain-to-carter-make-uclass-a-long-range-strike-plane/">not necessarily manned ones</a> — could keep the Navy’s favorite flagships relevant.</p>
<p>Andrew Krepinevich</p>
<p>In fact, Krepinevich notes, most military revolutions begin on the 
margin, with a few cutting-edge systems in an otherwise traditional 
force, if only because that’s all most militaries can afford. The German
 army of the blitzkrieg had more horse-drawn carts than tanks. The US 
Navy of December 7, 1941 had more battleships than aircraft carriers — 
and the battleships that survived, refitted with extra anti-aircraft 
guns, played an important supporting role in the carrier war that 
followed. A relatively small amount of new technology, applied using new
 tactics, can make a decisive difference for a large force. The trick, 
of course, is figuring out what <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2014/11/hagel-launches-offset-strategy-lists-key-technologies/">the right new technologies</a> and tactics are.</p>
<p>That’s the discussion Krepinevich hopes to help start.</p>
<p>“This is really version 1.0,” he said of his report. “This is a best 
first guess, and it’s based on trends,” he said, but there are a 
tremendous number of variables in play, more so perhaps than any 
previous time in military history. Nevertheless, he went on, “it’s 
better to have something like this, that provides that point of 
departure, than to have nothing at all and just keep stumbling toward <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/tag/navy-future/">the future</a>.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“It’s the beginning of the conversation,” Krepinevich said. “It’s not the end.”</p>
