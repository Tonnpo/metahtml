<p>There isn't a lot of information about the world's youngest dictator.
 He doesn't talk about his personal life, and you can find very weird 
things in his official biography. Your only chance to find something out
 about this man is to read what very observant journalists write or to 
read the reports from South Korean intelligence.</p>
<p>We at Bright Side decided to collect some interesting facts about the
 most unpredictable politician of modern times. Maybe he is not that 
scary at all?</p>
<h3>1. His date of birth is unknown.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.eastnews.ru/" rel="nofollow">© AP/FOTOLINK</a></p>
<p>Kim Jong-un was born on January 8 or July 6, 1982, or maybe 1983. Or 
maybe 1984. Why such a mystery? It is said that the leader wants to look
 older and more mature, so his official date of birth is 1982. But South
 Korean intelligence <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/the-secret-life-of-kim-jong-uns-aunt-who-has-lived-in-the-us-since-1998/2016/05/26/522e4ec8-12d7-11e6-a9b5-bf703a5a7191_story.html?utm_term=.c8410584c770">claims</a> that Kim Jong-un was actually born 2 years later.</p>
<p>Anyway, he is one of the youngest leaders in the world.</p>
<h3>2. His eyebrows are becoming shorter.</h3>

<p>In photos taken in different years, it is clear to see that there is 
something weird going on with the North Korean leader's eyebrows: they 
are becoming shorter. It is believed that he has them made to look more 
like his father, Kim Jong-il. Of course, it's just a theory, and it 
would be even stranger for Kim Jong-un to address this matter in an 
official statement.</p>
<h3>3. His childhood is a mystery.</h3>
<p><a href="http://nationalpost.com/news/baby-dictators-first-steps-rare-childhood-pictures-of-north-koreas-kim-jong-un-emerge" rel="nofollow">© EPA/KCTV / HANDOUT/nationalpost</a></p>
<p>This man doesn't want to publish his childhood photographs either. However, in 2014, this shot and some <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/10779572/New-childhood-pictures-of-Kim-Jong-un-emerge.html">others</a>
 were shown on the screen during a big military holiday in North Korea. 
Allegedly, they are pictures of the country's leader from when he was 
young, but nobody knows for sure if it is really true.</p>
<h3>4. He chose girls for a local pop band.</h3>
<p>There is pop music in North Korea, but it is not similar to what we 
know. For example, instead of the musicians with long hair that pop 
singers often have in their bands, North Korean bands have military 
orchestras. In music videos, they have to show how well North Korean 
people live.</p>
<p>One of the most famous girl bands in North Korea is "Moranbong" (we are sure you want to see the video from their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCQ3iJLuw8M">concert</a>). It is said that the leader himself chose the girls for the band.</p>
<h3>5. He has several official titles.</h3>
<p><a href="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/313140980311561055/" rel="nofollow">© Kimberly Burnett-Hanssen</a></p>
<p>Of course, it's "The Main Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Leader of the Party, and the People."</p>
<p>And also:</p>
<ul> <li>"The New Start"</li> <li>"The Brilliant Comrade"</li> <li>"The Genius Among Others"</li> <li>"The Marshall of North Korea" (since 2012)</li> </ul>
<p>Besides, this man has a degree in physics from the University of Kim 
Il-sung and a degree in economics from the private University HELP in 
Malaysia.</p>
<h3>6. He was educated in Switzerland under a different name.</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/new-stories-emerge-from-north-korean-dictator-kim-jonguns-swiss-school-days/news-story/4d49237a5dbe99d421bb8ec7ae60974c" rel="nofollow">© news</a></p>
<p>In a very prestigious school near Bern, Switzerland, there was a 
student from North Korea from 1998 to 2000. He was registered as a 
member of the embassy. He didn't state what his real name was. It's hard
 to tell if it was the future North Korean leader by looking at these 
photos. But the people who learned with him are absolutely sure that it 
was Kim Jong-un himself. They <a href="http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/new-stories-emerge-from-north-korean-dictator-kim-jonguns-swiss-school-days/news-story/4d49237a5dbe99d421bb8ec7ae60974c">remember</a> that he was a funny person, and he was interested in sports much more than politics. And he wasn't a good student.</p>
<h3>7. He loves basketball, and he is friends with Dennis Rodman.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.eastnews.ru/" rel="nofollow">© Kyodo/FOTOLINK</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.eastnews.ru/" rel="nofollow">© Kyodo/FOTOLINK</a></p>
<p>The same school friends also claim that in his youth, Kim Jong-un 
used to draw the basketball star Michael Jordan. And it's true that the 
politician loves basketball. In 2013, he even met Dennis Rodman and 
showed him his personal island. Despite the enormous difference between 
these 2 people, they became friends. Dennis says, "Maybe he is a 
psychopath, but I didn't notice that."</p>
<h3>8. He laughs and smiles in every photo.</h3>
<p>Look at some photos of the politician who scares many countries. This is him on Paektu Mountain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eastnews.ru/" rel="nofollow">© AP/EAST NEWS</a></p>
<p>This is him trying tactical missiles. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.eastnews.ru/" rel="nofollow">© XIHNUA/SIPA/EAST NEWS</a></p>
<p>This is him planting trees with students. </p>
<p>It might seem a little strange that the leader of such a serious 
country smiles so much, but it's actually for a reason: Kim Jong-un 
needs to demonstrate to the people that he is the personification of 
joy.</p>
<h3>9. He has a hipster-like haircut.</h3>
<p><a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/124713" rel="nofollow">© pxhere</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.eastnews.ru/" rel="nofollow">© EAST NEWS</a></p>
<p>It is funny, but there is nothing strange about Kim Jong-un's 
haircut. Actually, this is a simple military haircut. You can see such a
 haircut on Brad Pitt in Fury and on millions of hipsters around the 
world.</p>
<p>The dictator's haircut looks strange because he wears it the wrong 
way. He brushes his hair strangely, and it looks bad because of the 
shape of his face. Rumor has it that he doesn't trust barbers and cuts 
his hair himself.</p>
<h3>10. He doesn't need to visit the bathroom.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.eastnews.ru/" rel="nofollow">© AP/EAST NEWS</a></p>
<p>At least, that's what the North Korean people believe. The same could
 be said about his father, Kim Jong-il (you can read about this in his 
official biography).</p>
<h3>11. If Kim Jong-un lost weight, he would look like this:</h3>

<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/72vqga/skinny_kim_jong_un_would_make_the_situation_with/">alfosn</a>
 posted a photo online where he made the leader lose some pounds. Users 
noticed that Kim Jong-un looks even scarier after weight loss than the 
ever-smiling plump guy.</p>
