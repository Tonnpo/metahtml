<p class="rm-manual">September 2020</p>
<p>Mozilla is in an absolute state: high overheads, falling usage of 
Firefox, questionable sources of revenue and now making big cuts to 
engineering as their income falls.</p>
<figcaption> Mozilla's top exec pay has gone up hugely even as usage has crashed. </figcaption><p>Mozilla
 recently announced that they would be dismissing 250 people. That's a 
quarter of their workforce so there are some deep cuts to their work 
too. The victims include: the MDN docs (those are the web standards docs
 everyone likes better than w3schools), the Rust compiler and even some 
cuts to Firefox development. Like most people I want to see Mozilla do 
well but those three projects comprise pretty much what I think of as 
the whole point of Mozilla, so this news is a big let down.</p>
<p>The stated reason for the cuts is falling income. Mozilla largely 
relies on "royalties" for funding. In return for payment, Mozilla allows
 big technology companies to choose the default search engine in Firefox
 - the technology companies are ultimately paying to increase the number
 of searches Firefox users make with them. Mozilla haven't been 
particularly transparent about why these royalties are being reduced, 
except to blame the coronavirus.</p>
<p>I'm sure the coronavirus is not a great help but I suspect the bigger
 problem is that Firefox's market share is now a tiny fraction of its 
previous size and so the royalties will be smaller too - fewer users, so
 fewer searches and therefore less money for Mozilla.</p>
<p>The real problem is not the royalty cuts, though. Mozilla has already
 received more than enough money to set themselves up for financial 
independence. Mozilla received up to half a billion dollars a year (each
 year!) for many years. The real problem is that Mozilla didn't use that
 money to achieve financial independence and instead just spent it each 
year, doing the organisational equivalent of living hand-to-mouth.</p>
<p>Despite their slightly contrived legal structure as a non-profit that
 owns a for-profit, Mozilla are an NGO just like any other. In this 
article I want to apply the traditional measures that are applied to 
other NGOs to Mozilla in order to show what's wrong.</p>
<p>These three measures are: overheads, ethics and results.</p>
<h2>Overheads</h2>
<p>One of the most popular and most intuitive ways to evaluate an NGO is
 to judge how much of their spending is on their programme of works (or 
"mission") and how much is on other things, like administration and 
fundraising. If you give money to a charity for feeding people in the 
third world you hope that most of the money you give them goes on food -
 and not, for example, on company cars for head office staff.</p>
<p>Mozilla looks bad when considered in this light. Fully 30% of all 
expenditure goes on administration. Charity Navigator, an organisation 
that measures NGO effectiveness, would give them <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=48#PerformanceMetricTwo"> zero out of ten</a>
 on the relevant metric. For context, to achieve 5/10 on that measure 
Mozilla admin would need to be under 25% of spending and, for 10/10, 
under 15%.</p>
<p>Senior executives have also done very well for themselves. Mitchell 
Baker, Mozilla's top executive, was paid $2.4m in 2018, a sum I 
personally think of as instant inter-generational wealth. Payments to 
Baker have more than doubled in the last five years.</p>
<p>As far as I can find, there is no UK-based NGO whose top executive 
makes more than Â£1m ($1.3m) a year. The UK certainly has its fair share
 of big international NGOs - many much bigger and more significant than 
Mozilla.</p>
<p>I'm aware that <a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/relationship-between-overheads-and-effectiveness/"> some people dislike overheads as a measure</a>
 and argue that it's possible for administration spending to increase 
effectiveness. I think it's hard to argue that Mozilla's overheads are 
correlated with any improvement in effectiveness.</p>
<h2>Ethics</h2>
<p>Mozilla now thinks of itself less as a custodian of the old Netscape 
suite and more as a 'privacy NGO'. One slogan inside Mozilla is: "Beyond
 the Browser".</p>
<p>Regardless of how they view themselves, most of their income comes 
from helping to direct traffic to Google by making that search engine 
the default in Firefox. Google make money off that traffic via a big 
targeted advertising system that tracks people across the web and 
largely without their consent. Indeed, one of the reasons this income is
 falling is because as Firefox's usage falls less traffic is being 
directed Google's way and so Google will pay less.</p>
<p>There is, as yet, no outbreak of agreement among the moral 
philosophers as to a universal code of ethics. However I think most 
people would recognise hypocrisy in Mozilla's relationship with Google. 
Beyond the ethical problems, the relationship certainly seems to create 
conflicts of interest. Anyone would think that a privacy NGO would build
 anti-tracking countermeasures into their browser right from the start. 
In fact, this was only added relatively recently (<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/06/04/firefox-now-available-with-enhanced-tracking-protection-by-default/">in 2019</a>), after both Apple (<a href="https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/">in 2017</a>)
 and Brave (since release) paved the way. It certainly seems like 
Mozilla's status as a Google vassal has played a role in the absence of 
anti-tracking features in Firefox for so long.</p>
<p>Another ethical issue is Mozilla's big new initiative to <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">move into VPNs</a>.
 This doesn't make a lot of sense from a privacy point of view. Broadly 
speaking: VPNs are not a useful privacy tool for people browsing the 
web. A VPN lets you access the internet through a proxy - so your 
requests superficially appear to come from somewhere other than they 
really do. This does nothing to address the main privacy problem for web
 users: that they are being passively tracked and de-anonymised on a 
massive scale by the baddies at Google and elsewhere. This tracking 
happens regardless of IP address.</p>
<p>When I tested Firefox through <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">Mozilla VPN</a> (a rebrand of <a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad VPN</a>)
 I found that I could be de-anonymised by browser fingerprinting - 
already a fairly widespread technique by which various elements of your 
browser are examined to create a "fingerprint" which can then be used to
 re-identify you later. Firefox does not include as many countermeasures
 against this as some other browsers (this is a correction - I 
previously said Firefox contained none but it's been pointed out to me 
that <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/01/07/firefox-72-fingerprinting/">since earlier this year</a> it does block some kinds of fingerprinting).</p>
<figcaption> Even when using Mozilla's "secure and private" VPN, Firefox is trackable by browser fingerprinting, as demonstrated by the <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">EFF's Panopticlick tool</a>. Other browsers use randomised fingerprints as a countermeasure against this tracking. </figcaption><p>Another
 worry is that many of these privacy focused VPN services have a nasty 
habit of turning out to keep copious logs on user behaviour. A few 
months ago several "no log" VPN services inadvertently released 
terabytes of private user data that they had promised not to collect <a href="https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-free-vpns-leak/">in a massive breach</a>.
 VPN services are in a great position to eavesdrop - and even if they 
promise not to, your only option is to take them at their word.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I've discussed the Mozilla chair's impressive pay: $2.4m/year. Surely
 such impressive pay is justified by the equally impressive results 
Mozilla has achieved? Sadly on almost every measure of results both 
quantitative and qualitative, Mozilla is a dog.</p>
<p>Firefox is now so niche it is in danger of garnering a cult 
following: it has just 4% market share, down from 30% a decade ago. 
Mobile browsing numbers are bleak: Firefox barely exists on phones, with
 a market share of less than half a percent. This is baffling given that
 mobile Firefox has a rare feature for a mobile browser: it's able to 
install extensions and so can block ads.</p>
<p>Yet despite the problems within their core business, Mozilla, instead
 of retrenching, has diversified rapidly. In recent years Mozilla has 
created:</p>
<ul> <li>a mobile app for making websites</li> <li>a federated identity system</li> <li>a large file transfer service</li> <li>a password manager</li> <li>an internet-of-things framework/standard</li> <li>an email relay service</li> <li>a completely new phone operating system</li> <li>an AI division (but of course)</li> <li>and spent $25 million buying the reading list management startup, Pocket</li> </ul>
<p>Many of the above are now abandoned.</p>
<p>Sadly <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2018/">Mozilla's annual report</a>
 doesn't break down expenses on a per-project basis so it's impossible 
to know how much of the spending that is on Mozilla's programme is being
 spent on Firefox and how much is being spent on all these other 
side-projects.</p>
<p>What you can at least infer is that the side-projects are expensive. 
Software development always is. Each of the projects named above (and 
all the other ones that were never announced or that I don't know about)
 will have required business analysts, designers, user researchers, 
developers, testers and all the other people you need in order to create
 a consumer web project.</p>
<p>The biggest cost of course is the opportunity cost of just spending 
that money on other stuff - or nothing: it could have been invested to 
build an endowment. Now Mozilla is in the situation where apparently 
there isn't enough money left to fully fund Firefox development.</p>
<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>Mozilla can't just continue as before. At the very least they need to
 reduce their expenses to go along with their now reduced income. That 
income is probably still pretty enormous though: likely hundreds of 
millions a year.</p>
<p>I'm a Firefox user (and one of the few on mobile, apparently) and I 
want to see Mozilla succeed. As such, I would hope that Mozilla would 
cut their cost of administration. I'd also hope that they'd increase 
spending on Firefox to make it faster and implement those privacy 
features that other browsers have. Most importantly: I'd like them to 
start building proper financial independence.</p>
<p>I doubt those things will happen. Instead they will likely keep the 
expensive management. They have already cut spending on Firefox. Their 
great hope is to continue trying new things, like using their brand to 
sell VPN services that, as I've discussed, do not solve the problem that
 their users have.</p>
<p>Instead of diversifying into yet more products and services Mozilla 
should probably just ask their users for money. For many years the 
Guardian newspaper (a similarly sized organisation to Mozilla in terms 
of staff) was a financial basket case. The Guardian started <a href="https://support.theguardian.com/uk/contribute">asking their readers for money</a> a few years ago and seems to be on firmer financial footing since.</p>
<p>Getting money directly has also helped align the incentives of their 
organisation with those of their readers. Perhaps that would work for 
Mozilla. But then, things are different at the Guardian. Their chief 
exec makes a mere Â£360,000 a year.</p>

<h3 class="rm-manual">Other charities with cost control problems</h3>
<p class="rm-manual">Another notable technology NGO with huge expenses is The Wikimedia foundation. You can read more about their problems in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Guy_Macon/Wikipedia_has_Cancer">Wikipedia has Cancer</a>
 which uses a very dodgy metaphor but is otherwise a good study of 
incredible spending growth there. Wikimedia has the advantage over 
Mozilla that all contributors to its main project are unpaid - which 
only makes the expenses all the more mindblowing. Wikimedia, like 
Mozilla, has had a lot of side projects. At one point they were trying, 
in secret, to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Engine_(Wikimedia_Foundation)">whole new search engine</a>.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">A good example of a charity that shut down due to poor expense control is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_Company">Kids Company</a>,
 a British charity for helping vulnerable children. The Kids Company 
debacle shows that shutdown can be quite abrupt. The British government 
provided most of the funding but (eventually) lost faith and ceased 
their annual grant which resulted in the charity being immediately 
liquidated. A House of Commons committee released <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmpubadm/433/433.pdf"> a good report</a>.</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">Sources I used</h3>
<p class="rm-manual">Mozilla's legal structure as a non-profit that owns
 a for-profit arm makes their government filings ("Form 990"s) of pretty
 limited use as they aren't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_financial_statement">consolidated</a>
 and don't contain any information about the majority of Mozilla 
activities. The most useful thing about these documents is that people 
who are on the board of the parent have to disclose pay from the 
subsidary (in Part IX, generally on page 10). <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/200097189">Propublica</a> have a complete set.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">More useful is Mozilla's annual report, which is 
consolidated. I haven't been able to find a master index of these but 
you can get there via the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2018/">"State of Mozilla"</a> pages - you'll need to edit the year in the url to get previous annual reports.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">I used <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet/worldwide/#yearly-2009-2020"> statcounter's usage data</a>. I haven't included any 2020 data as the year isn't out yet but it's even worse than 2019 for Firefox.</p></article>
