<p>I weave through book after article after website</p>
<p> all on how the US military once used</p>
<p> my island home</p>
<p> for nuclear testing</p>
<p> I sift through political jargon</p>
<p> tables of nuclear weapons</p>
<p> with names like Operation Bravo</p>
<p> Crossroads</p>
<p> and Ivy</p>
<p> quotes from American leaders like</p>
<p> 90,000 people are out there?</p>
<p> who gives a damn?</p>
<p>—Kathy Jetn̄il-Kijiner, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIIrrPyK0eU">History Project</a>” (2012)</p>
<p>On March 1, 1954, on the so-called “Pacific Proving Grounds” of the 
Marshall Islands, the United States military detonated a 15 megaton 
thermonuclear weapon called “Bravo” (the first in the “CASTLE” test 
series) and exposed the residents of the Bikini Atoll to its radioactive
 fallout.</p>
<p>Shortly after the blast, <a href="https://www.wagingpeace.org/human-radiation-experiments-in-the-pacific/">US officials</a>
 claimed that “meteorologists had predicted a wind condition which 
should have carried the fallout to the north of a group of small atolls 
lying to the east of Bikini… The wind failed to follow the predictions 
but shifted south of that line and the little islands of Rongelap, 
Rongerik and Utirik were in the edge of the path of the fallout.”</p>
<p>Those down-wind of the explosions suffered severe burns and were 
exposed to massive amounts of radiation, irreversibly altering the 
trajectory of the region and its inhabitants forever.</p>
<p>Following the Bravo detonation, a team of American scientists began 
Project 4.1, a medical study in which the biomedical and physiological 
impacts on the contaminated islanders were monitored without their 
informed consent.</p>
<p>In effect, the Marshallese served as human guinea pigs in a massive nuclear experiment. In 1956, <a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/materials/nuclear-savage/">Merril Eisenbud</a>,
 director of the US Atomic Energy Agency’s health and safety laboratory,
 summarized the attitude of the American government when he said the 
Marshall Islands were “by far the most contaminated place on Earth and 
it will be very interesting to get a measure of human uptake when people
 live in a contaminated environment.”</p>
<p>In total, 67 nuclear tests were conducted near the Marshall Islands between 1946 and 1958. <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2021/mar/17/how-the-legacy-of-nuclear-testing-in-the-marshall-/">Holly Barker</a>,
 an anthropologist from the University of Washington, notes that “if you
 take the equivalent of 67 nuclear tests conducted that we know occurred
 and stretch those out over the 12-year testing period… it’s 1.6 
Hiroshima-sized bombs every day for 12 years.”</p>
<p>Although Project 4.1 officially ended decades ago, catastrophic 
health issues continue to affect many Marshallese. Cancer and birth 
defects remain widespread among the communities. It is even common for 
women to give birth to what locals call “jellyfish babies” because of 
their translucent skin and lack of bone structure.</p>
<p>The nation mourns the catastrophic fallout visited upon them by the 
US every year on March 1, a national holiday dubbed Nuclear Remembrance 
Day, or “Bikini Day” after the atoll where the CASTLE Bravo bomb was 
detonated.</p>
<p>In 1946, hundreds of Bikinians were relocated before the US detonated
 23 nuclear bombs at the Bikini Atoll between 1946 and 1958. While 
Bikinians were returned to their homes in 1969, they were evacuated 
again in 1978 because of high levels of radioactive elements found in 
their bodies. Photo courtesy the United States military.</p>
<p>A large portion of the population no longer lives on the islands, 
however. Many Marshallese relocated to the US after the signing of the 
Compact of Free Association (COFA) in 1986, an agreement which allows 
the islanders to live and work in America but does not grant them 
citizenship. One of the largest concentrations of Marshallese in the US 
is in Washington state—which, ironically, is where the plutonium and 
uranium for the Bravo test was mined.</p>
<p>This March, the COFA Alliance National Network held the virtual <a href="https://www.cann-wa.us/our-work">Marshall Islands Nuclear Remembrance Week</a>.
 Their program reads: “We are not alone! We shall never forget! The 
resilience and strength of nuclear frontline communities who are 
continuing to fight for dignity and respect must be upheld by these 
remembered stories towards justice.”</p>
<p>The Marshallese struggle for dignified treatment by the US government
 continues to this day. While their plight is often ignored by the media
 and politicians alike, they briefly entered the news in December 2020 
when Congressional lawmakers agreed to allow Marshallese living in the 
US to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/20/congress-restores-medicaid-pacific-islanders-449480">sign up for Medicaid</a>, reversing a decision in a 1996 reform package that barred islanders from the program.</p>
<p>One of the difficulties the Marshallese faced in securing Medicaid 
was proving that their health issues are the result of the nuclear 
tests. According to journalist Arielle Dreher, writing in the 
Spokesman-Review, “Only the Enewetak, Bikini, Utrik and Rongelap atolls 
were considered exposed by the United States,” which ignores fallout 
across the numerous other islands. Therefore, only individuals 
contaminated by the Bravo test are immediately eligible for healthcare 
benefits with the passage of this recent legislation. Victims of the 
other 66 tests will not qualify for Medicaid, and the onus is on them to
 prove the culpability of the US state.</p>
<p>These islanders represent one of several groups who continue to live 
with the adverse impacts of nuclear colonialism, defined by professor <a href="https://davidtitterington.medium.com/nuclear-colonialism-98463eb1d2f7">David Titterington</a> as “an ongoing history of nuclear tests, uranium mining and nuclear waste disposal on Indigenous lands across North America.”</p>
<p>The impact of nuclear weapons development on the American Indigenous 
population is indeed another brutal legacy of the tests: in order to 
produce the bombs which devastated Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the Marshall 
Islands, the US government first thoughtlessly extracted the materials 
from Indigenous lands and dumped the radioactive waste back in their 
communities, resulting in high rates of cancers, <a href="https://25yearslatersite.com/2019/02/27/no-stars-the-united-states-demonic-shadow/">15 times the national average</a>.
 Women on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota, for example, are 
six times more likely to have miscarriages than the average American, 
due to radioactive waste from a nearby uranium mine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wagingpeace.org/human-radiation-experiments-in-the-pacific/">Almira Matayoshi</a>,
 an inhabitant of Rongelap island, recounts the ways in which the lives 
of her people were irreversibly altered by the detonations:</p>
<blockquote> I have pains and much fear of the bomb. At that time I 
wanted to die, and we were really suffering; our bodies ached and our 
feet were covered with burns and our hair fell out. Now I see babies 
growing up abnormally and some are mentally disturbed, but none of these
 things happened before the bomb. </blockquote>
<p> For contemporary inhabitants of the Marshall Islands, the detonation
 of the atomic bomb was a breach, a bifurcation of lived reality—there 
is the “before” and there is the grisly “after” to which the islanders 
have been subjected ever since. Adding insult to injury, the islanders 
have been afforded only the most begrudging acknowledgement from the US 
government.</p>
<p>In North America and the Pacific, the grave consequences of nuclear 
colonialism are still being felt. But we can’t understand these tests as
 “mistakes” attributed to historical figures of the past. Their impacts 
continue to reverberate in many ways.</p>
<p>Last year, Susanne Rust of the the Los Angeles Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-07-01/us-says-nuclear-waste-safe-marshall-islands-runit-dome">reported</a>
 that the Runit Dome in the Marshall Islands, a 50-year-old repository 
for atomic waste that the US produced during Cold War weapons testing, 
was potentially leaking small amounts of radioactive waste into a nearby
 lagoon.</p>
<p>Nowhere else on Earth, wrote Rust, has the United States “saddled 
another country with so much of its nuclear waste… The [site], known 
alternatively as the Tomb, holds more than 3.1 million cubic feet—or 35 
Olympic-size swimming pools—of US-produced radioactive soil and debris, 
including lethal amounts of plutonium.”</p>
<p>Indeed, nuclear colonialism has resulted in irrevocable damage to the
 Marshallese, and to Indigenous lands around the world. But the horrible
 afterlife of the Bravo test is far from being relegated to history’s 
dustbin—it lives on in the continued production and proliferation of 
ever more advanced nuclear weapons and delivery systems, <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/smr/nuclear-arsenal/2020/06/14/nuclear-modernization-speeding-up-as-arms-control-on-the-brink-report/">particularly by the Unites States</a>. If we want to live in a world free of nuclear colonialism and environmental racism, we must see nuclear weapons as an ‘<a href="https://scholarworks.merrimack.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=atb">agent of oppression</a>,’ and abolish them for good.</p>
