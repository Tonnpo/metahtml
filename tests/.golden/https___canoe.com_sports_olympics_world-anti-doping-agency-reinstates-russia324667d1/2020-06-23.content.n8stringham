<p>The World Anti-Doping Agency declared Russia’s scandal-ridden 
drug-fighting operation back in business Thursday, a decision designed 
to bring a close to one of sports’ most notorious doping scandals but 
one bitterly disputed by hundreds of athletes and described as 
“treachery” by the lawyer for the man who exposed the corruption.</p>
<p>On a 9-2 vote, the executive committee took the advice of the 
agency’s compliance review panel and declared RUSADA as having satisfied
 conditions of reinstatement that were gradually softened over the 
summer.</p>
<p>In most tangible ways, the decision doesn’t change much: RUSADA has 
been up and running for a while, bringing one of the world’s largest 
testing programs back on line with the help of officials from Britain 
and elsewhere. And Russia’s Olympic committee was brought back into the 
fold after the Pyeongchang Olympics, where athletes who could prove they
 were clean were able to compete as “Olympic Athletes from Russia.”</p>
<p>But RUSADA’s reinstatement now clears the country to again bid for 
major international events — although soccer’s World Cup was held there 
this summer despite that restriction.</p>
<p>It also clears a major hurdle for Russia’s track team to be declared 
compliant by that sport’s international governing body, one of the few 
to take a strong, consistent stand against doping.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, hundreds of athletes and dozens of world 
anti-doping leaders see it as a stinging rebuke to the ideal of fair 
play.</p>
<p>“WADA’s decision to reinstate Russia represents the greatest 
treachery against clean athletes in Olympic history,” said Jim Walden, 
the attorney for Grigory Rodchenkov, the former Moscow lab director who 
exposed much of the Russian scheme.</p>
<p>WADA had been telegraphing the move since Sept. 14, when it released 
the recommendation of its compliance review committee. Olympic champion 
Beckie Scott resigned from that committee afterward.</p>
<p>“I’m profoundly disappointed,” Scott said to Canadian broadcaster CBC
 after the decision. “I feel this was an opportunity for WADA, and they 
have dealt a devastating blow to clean sport. I’m quite dismayed.”</p>
<p>Even in Russia, where the news was welcomed, it came with a sense that there’s still work to be done.</p>
<p>“These questions will always follow us,” said RUSADA CEO Yuri Ganus, 
whose appointment to the job was part of the housecleaning at the agency
 that WADA demanded. “These aren’t the kind of skeletons which can lie 
unnoticed in the closet. These are the skeletons which will be banging 
on the closet door all the time.”</p>
<p>The two biggest roadblocks to RUSADA’s reinstatement involved the 
country accepting findings from a report by investigator Richard McLaren
 that concluded the government had engineered the doping scandal to win 
medals at the Sochi Olympics. It also involved Russia agreeing to hand 
over a trove of data and samples that could be used to corroborate 
potential doping violations that stemmed from the cheating.</p>
<p>Over a summer’s worth of correspondence between WADA leaders and 
Russia’s sports minister about how to bridge the gap, a pattern emerged 
of WADA backing down from its initial requirements and, at one point, 
essentially asking Russia what it would be willing to say in a letter 
designed to satisfy the WADA review committee.</p>
<p>“We think that a small addition to the letter, if acceptable to you, 
could ensure that the letter is well received … and that a positive 
recommendation is provided,” WADA CEO Olivier Niggli wrote to sports 
minister Pavel Kolobkov in May in a letter obtained by BBC Sport .</p>
<p>In the end, Russia agreed to accept findings of an IOC-commissioned 
report that put less onus on the Russian government for the scheme, a 
move that Rodchenkov said earlier this week was done “for the pure 
purpose of protecting their top-level apparatchiks who destroyed the 
Olympic Games in Sochi.”</p>
<p>Russia also agreed to hand over the samples and data by Dec. 31. If it does not, RUSADA will again be declared noncompliant.</p>
<p>“Without this pragmatic approach, we would continue with the impasse 
and the laboratory data could have remained out of our reach 
indefinitely,” WADA president Craig Reedie said after Thursday’s 
executive committee meeting in Seychelles.</p>
<p>Critics said reinstating RUSADA before obtaining the data only 
amounts to accepting another promise from a country that hasn’t kept 
many over the five-year course of the scandal.</p>
<p>Travis Tygart, the CEO for the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, called the 
decision “bewildering and inexplicable,” and urged a full revamping of 
WADA; Reedie also serves as a member of the IOC, which is one of the 
many conflicts of interest that bother critics of the agency.</p>
<p>“Let’s be clear: Absolutely nothing will be off the table for how we,
 the anti-doping community, begin the work of reforming WADA,” Tygart 
said.</p>
<p>Reedie said “WADA understands that this decision will not please everybody.”</p>
<p>“Clean athletes were denied places at the Olympic and Paralympic 
Games, as well as other major events, and others were cheated of 
medals,” he said. “It is entirely understandable that they should be 
wary about the supposed rehabilitation of offenders.”</p>
