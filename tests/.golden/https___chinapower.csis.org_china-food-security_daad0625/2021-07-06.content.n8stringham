<p>Food security is critical to the well-being of all countries. Fragile
 states are often those that are the most food insecure, as limited 
access to basic staples can undermine a country’s social and economic 
stability. Decades of economic growth have enabled China’s leaders to 
make considerable strides in increasing food access across the country, 
but China’s economic boom has generated a new set of demographic demands
 and environmental strains.</p>
<h2>China’s Food Trade with the World</h2>
<p>China’s Food Trade with the World</p>
<h2>The Changing Dietary Landscape</h2>
<p>Rapid economic growth has fueled dramatic reductions in China’s undernourished population. Undernourishment is <a href="http://www.fao.org/hunger/en/" rel="nofollow">defined</a>
 by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as the condition of an 
individual not acquiring enough food to meet the minimum dietary energy 
requirements for a year, and is a key indicator of <a href="http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/ess/ess_test_folder/Workshops_Events/Food_Security_for_All_FEB2011/Background_paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">chronic hunger</a>.</p>
<p>According to the FAO, China’s undernourished population rate fell from <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SN.ITK.DEFC.ZS?locations=CN-IN-BR-RU-ZA" rel="nofollow">16.2 percent</a> in 2000 to 8.6 percent in 2017. This decline has taken place alongside a rise in annual <a href="https://chinapower.csis.org/china-development-tracker/" rel="nofollow">per capita income</a>
 from just $330 to $9,460 over the same period, and enabled China to 
reach United Nations targets aimed at cutting world hunger rates in half
 by 2015. China was one of just 29 countries that met its respective 
goals, and it accounted for two-thirds of the total reduction in 
undernourished people among Asian countries from 2010 to 2017.</p>
<p>Prevalence of Undernourishment (% of population)</p>
<p>China has historically strived for self-sufficiency in domestic food production. In 1996, the government issued a <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/e-white/grainissue/index.htm" rel="nofollow">white paper</a>
 that established a 95 percent self-sufficiency target for grains 
including rice, wheat, and corn. China’s domestic production has for the
 most part risen to meet the country’s growing demand.</p>
<p>Over the past several decades, China’s grain consumption has more 
than tripled from 125 million metric tons (tonnes, t) in 1975 to 420 
million tonnes in 2018.<span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-1050">1</a></span>
 Considerable investments in agriculture have enabled China’s farmers to
 produce high volumes of staple crops, allowing the country to achieve a
 roughly <a href="https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/app/index.html" rel="nofollow">one-to-one</a>
 ratio of production and consumption of grains. India has achieved a 
similar one-to-one ratio of grain production and consumption, but it has
 also positioned itself as the world’s leading exporter of rice. In 
2018-2019, India <a href="https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/app/index.html#/app/downloads" rel="nofollow">exported</a>
 nearly 9.8 million tonnes of rice – roughly 22.5 percent of the global 
total. China by comparison was the sixth-largest exporter over the same 
period, accounting for just 6.3 percent of global exports.</p>
<p>Agricultural leaders like the US and Australia have a higher grain 
production-consumption ratio. The US on average produces roughly 1.4 
times more grain than it consumes. Australia, which boasts the most 
arable land per capita in the world, produces more than three times as 
much wheat as it consumes. </p>
<p>Meat Consumption in China, USA, and EU</p>
<p>With regard to meat products, China has witnessed an astronomical 
increase in consumption. In 1975, China consumed a mere 7 million tonnes
 of meat.<span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-1050">2</a></span> That 
figure had grown to 86.5 million tonnes by 2018, making it the largest 
meat consumer in the world At 55.2 million tonnes consumed, pork was 
China’s top meat source in 2018 by a wide margin. On a per capita basis,
 China consumed <a href="https://data.oecd.org/agroutput/meat-consumption.htm" rel="nofollow">48.9 kilograms (kg)</a>
 of meat per person in 2018 – roughly half as much as the US (99 kg per 
capita) and Australia (93 kg), but slightly higher than Japan (43 kg).</p>
<p>This exploding demand for meat in China can be largely attributed to changing demographics. The emergence of China’s urban <a href="https://chinapower.csis.org/china-middle-class/" rel="nofollow">middle class</a>
 has corresponded with a shift away from a grain-oriented diet to an 
increasingly meat-heavy intake. More affluent urban residents have 
likewise developed an appetite for other resource-intensive foods, such 
as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/29/can-the-world-quench-chinas-bottomless-thirst-for-milk" rel="nofollow">dairy products</a>.</p>
<p>China has become increasingly reliant on imports to account for 
changing consumption habits. Between 2003 and 2017, China’s food imports
 grew from just $14 billion to $104.6 billion. While food exports nearly
 tripled from $20.2 billion to $59.6 billion over the same period, China
 increasingly finds itself running a food trade deficit.</p>
<p>This has prompted Beijing to openly reframe its food self-sufficiency
 strategy. At the Annual Central Rural Work Conference in 2013, Chinese 
leaders <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/China_s_Global_Quest_for_Resources.html?id=DJ3mjgEACAAJ" rel="nofollow">acknowledged</a> that the country would have to supplement its domestic supply with “moderate imports” in order to meet food security needs.</p>
<h2>Threats to China’s Food Security</h2>
<p>While economic development has allowed China to make enormous strides
 toward feeding its population, serious challenges remain. Chinese 
leaders faces the dual challenge of maintaining economic growth while 
feeding the country’s growing urban population with a countryside that 
features only <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.ARBL.HA.PC?locations=CN" rel="nofollow">0.21 acres</a> of arable land per capita.</p>
<aside><a href="https://chinapower.csis.org/china-water-security/" rel="nofollow"><span>Learn More</span><span>"How Does Water Security Affect China’s Development?"</span></a></aside><p>A
 lack of arable land is further complicated by the reality that poor 
regulation has caused significant environmental damage, which greatly 
limits domestic production capacity. In 2018, <a href="https://chinapower.csis.org/china-water-security/" rel="nofollow">15.5 percent </a>of
 China’s groundwater was labeled “Grade V,” meaning it was so polluted 
that it was unsuitable for any use. Widespread soil contamination, 
especially in southern areas like Henan province, prompted the 
government to prohibit the farming of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/china-environment-farmland-idUSL3N0K90OY20131230" rel="nofollow">8 million acres</a> of contaminated agricultural land until it can be rehabilitated.</p>
<p><span>A considerable increase in the number of groundwater monitoring
 stations likely contributed to the significant shift in groundwater 
quality in 2018.</span></p>
<p>These issues weighed down China’s standing in the 2018 <a href="https://foodsustainability.eiu.com/heat-map/" rel="nofollow">Food Sustainability Index</a>
 (FSI), which ranked China 23rd out of 67 countries in overall food 
sustainability, alongside South Korea (22nd) and the UK (24th). In the 
agricultural sustainability category, however, China wasclose to the 
bottom of the index at 57th, between Indonesia (56th) and Sudan (58th).</p>
<p>Major food safety scandals have also rocked the country. In 2008, 
tainted baby formula killed six infants and sickened more than 300,000. 
Additional scandals have included the seizure of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/world/in-china-stomachs-turn-at-news-of-traders-peddling-40-year-old-meat.html" rel="nofollow">$483 million</a>
 worth of illegally smuggled meat in 2015 – some of which was found to 
be more than 40 years old – and numerous instances of the use of illegal
 “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/10/chinas-frightening-unpleasant-cooking-oil-scandal/281000/" rel="nofollow">gutter oil</a>”
 in restaurants. These scandals have eroded consumer confidence in many 
Chinese-made food products, and have compelled Chinese consumers to seek
 products made outside of China. A 2016 survey found that roughly <a href="https://qz.com/1323471/ten-years-after-chinas-melamine-laced-infant-milk-tragedy-deep-distrust-remains/" rel="nofollow">40 percent</a> of Chinese consumers considered food safety to be “a very big problem,” up from just 12 percent in 2008.</p>

<p>The Chinese central government made major <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbalzano/2015/05/03/revised-food-safety-law-in-china-signals-many-changes-and-some-surprises/#677c69a76e59" rel="nofollow">revisions</a> to the national Food Safety Law in 2015 to tighten food safety regulations and strengthen enforcement, but <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsn3.1281" rel="nofollow">challenges</a> persist. The 2019 <a href="https://foodsecurityindex.eiu.com/Index" rel="nofollow">Global Food Security Index</a>
 ranked China 38th out of 113 countries in terms of food quality and 
safety. China not only placed behind wealthy European and North American
 countries (which occupy the top 10 spots), but also came in sixth among
 middle income countries, after Brazil, Belarus, Argentina, Costa Rica, 
and Mexico. </p>
<p>China is also heavily reliant on food imports from other countries. 
China’s demand for soybeans has skyrocketed in recent years, in large 
part because the crop is an important source of <a href="https://www.usda.gov/documents/coexistence-soybeans-factsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">animal feed</a> for livestock. From 2000 to 2018, Chinese soybean imports grew from $2.3 billion to nearly $38.1 billion,<span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-1050">3</a></span> leaving China as the world’s largest importer of the legume, by a wide margin. </p>
<p>As US-China trade tensions escalated in 2018, Chinese imports of US 
soybeans nearly halved from $13.9 billion in 2017 to just $7.1 billion 
in 2018. China turned to Brazil in response, expanding soybean imports 
from the South American agricultural giant by 37.9 percent to $28.8 
billion in 2018. Nevertheless, China’s appetite for soybeans <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2152109/why-china-cant-count-brazil-fill-soybean-gap-its-trade" rel="nofollow">exceeds</a> the production capacity of Brazil and most of the world combined, leaving the US to fill the gap.</p>
<p>China’s Soybean Imports</p>
<p>China’s primary meat source, pork, has also faced threats in recent 
years. In August 2018, China experienced its first outbreak of African 
swine fever. China was forced to limit the transport and selling of hogs
 at live markets to curb the spread of the virus, and it also culled 
more than one million pigs. Domestic pork production plummeted <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-output-pork/chinas-2019-pork-output-plunges-to-16-year-low-as-disease-culls-herd-idUSKBN1ZG08H" rel="nofollow">21.3 percent</a> in 2019, and pork imports from the US swelled by <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-04-17/chart-of-the-day-chinas-record-shattering-pork-imports-101544043.html" rel="nofollow">258 percent</a> that year. The outbreak of the disease proved costly for Chinese consumers. Domestic pork <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-said-african-swine-fever-was-stable-then-cases-climbed-again-11588071602" rel="nofollow">prices</a> more than doubled from about $2.6 per kg in January 2019 to nearly $7 per kg in February 2020.</p>
<h2>Shoring Up China’s Food Security</h2>
<p>Both the Chinese government and Chinese companies have worked to 
accommodate the country’s changing appetite and respond to food security
 shortcomings. Beijing provides massive subsidies to its agricultural 
industry. In 2018, China <a href="https://data.oecd.org/agrpolicy/agricultural-support.htm" rel="nofollow">paid out $206 billion</a>
 in agricultural subsidies – nearly twice as much as the EU ($110 
billion) and nearly five times as much as the US ($44 billion).</p>
<p>From a policy standpoint, the Chinese central government has put in 
place several measures designed to address the multifaceted challenges 
of food security and sustainable development.</p>
<p>Expand for a list of major policy measures</p>
<ul>
<li>China’s <a href="https://www.chinabusinessreview.com/13th-five-year-plan-stresses-economic-restructuring/" rel="nofollow">Thirteenth Five-Year Plan</a>
 (2016-2020) emphasized improvements to efficiency and quality for 
modernizing the agricultural sector, as well as greater openness to 
imports and overseas food processing.</li>
<li>The Ministry of Ecology and Environment issued a <a href="http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/content/2012/content_2121713.htm" rel="nofollow">plan</a> to cut underground water resource pollution by 2020.</li>
<li>The Ministry of Agriculture and the National Development and Reform Commission announced <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/china-farm-funding-idUSL4N1EE319?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews" rel="nofollow">plans</a> for a capital-based push for public-private partnerships in agriculture in December 2016.</li>
<li>The Ministry of Health released new dietary <a href="http://dg.cnsoc.org/article/04/8a2389fd575f695101577a35d9b602d6.html" rel="nofollow">guidelines</a> in May 2016 that recommended significant reduction in the consumption of meat.</li>
<li>The State Council issued new <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6025b7c8-92ff-11e3-8ea7-00144feab7de" rel="nofollow">guidelines</a>
 on stabilizing grain production at 550 million tonnes by 2020, while 
placing greater emphasis on non-grain food quality rather than quantity.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2017-07/13/content_5210134.htm" rel="nofollow">State Council</a> issued the National Nutrition Plan (2017-2030) in June 2017 to improve the nutrition and health standards.</li>
<li>The State Council released a <a href="http://www.scio.gov.cn/zfbps/32832/Document/1666228/1666228.htm" rel="nofollow">white paper</a>
 on food security in 2019, setting goals on enhancing food production, 
improving emergency grain reserves management, and building a modern 
grain circulation system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chinese leaders also appear increasingly open to boosting the 
country’s agricultural production through genetically modified (GM) 
crops. GM corn and soybean species passed Chinese biosafety evaluations 
in January 2020 – a major step toward commercializing GM crops in China.
 Yet development of GM products has repeatedly faced public pushback, 
which has complicated efforts to ramp up the country’s use of GM foods.</p>
<p>Chinese companies have endeavored to counter domestic production 
difficulties through major investments in agriculture-based assets 
abroad. Between 2000 and 2018, China purchased an estimated 3.2 million 
hectares of land abroad, making it the fourth largest buyer in the 
world, behind the US, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Malaysia. In
 Australia, China was the <a href="https://cdn.tspace.gov.au/uploads/sites/79/2018/12/Register_of_Foreign_Ownership_of_Agr.pdf" rel="nofollow">second-largest</a> foreign landholder in 2018, after the UK and ahead of the US.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Australia is one of the top global destinations for Chinese FDI. Where else is China investing abroad? <a href="file:///china-foreign-direct-investment/"> Learn more</a>.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="file:///china-foreign-direct-investment/">Explore More</a></p>
<p>China’s efforts to capitalize on Australia’s available land have, 
however, faced resistance. In 2015 and 2016, two Chinese companies were <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/11/19/australia-just-stopped-china-buying-a-farm-the-size-of-kentucky/" rel="nofollow">blocked</a>
 from purchasing Australia’s largest cattle business, S. Kidman and Co.,
 whose holdings comprise 2.5 percent of total Australian land area – 
roughly <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-china-landsale-idUSKCN0XQ0KR" rel="nofollow">the size of South Korea</a>.
 In both cases, then-Treasurer Scott Morrison cited national interest as
 grounds for the decision. China’s investment in Australian agribusiness
 plummeted accordingly from a record high of <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/au/pdf/2017/demystifying-chinese-investment-in-australia-may-2017.pdf" rel="nofollow">$857.1 million</a> in 2016 to <a href="http://demystifyingchina.com.au/reports/demystifying-chinese-investment-in-australia-april-2019.pdf" rel="nofollow">$63.5 million</a> in 2018.</p>
<p>Chinese investments in food production have also extended to the US. 
In 2013, China’s largest meat processor Shuanghui International <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Testimony_Slane2013.pdf" rel="nofollow">acquired</a> American Smithfield Foods for $7.1 billion, marking the second-largest Chinese acquisition of a U.S. company in history.</p>
<h2>Fishing Waters Near and Far</h2>
<p>Seafood has long been an important staple of the Chinese diet. China consumed <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/ca9229en/CA9229EN.pdf" rel="nofollow">55.2 million tonnes</a>
 of fish in 2017 – about 36 percent of the global total – making it the 
largest fish consumer in the world. In per capita terms, China consumed 
roughly 39 kg of fish per person in 2017, more than double the average 
of the rest of the world (15.5 kg).</p>
<p>Global Fishery Production</p>
<p>To keep up with domestic demand, China’s global fishing activities have increased dramatically in recent decades. China’s total <a href="http://www.fao.org/fishery/facp/CHN/en" rel="nofollow">aquatic food production</a>
 jumped from 15.1 tonnes in 1990 to 81 million tonnes in 2018, which 
accounted for just over 38 percent of global production. Aquaculture 
production is a particular strength for China. At more than 66.1 million
 tonnes in 2018, China’s aquaculture production accounted for an 
impressive 58 percent of global output.</p>
<p>In 2017, China supplied the rest of the world with over $20 billion 
worth of fish, roughly twice the amount of Norway, the world’s second 
largest fish exporter. China nonetheless still imported $11 billion 
worth of fish in 2017, making it the world’s third-largest fish 
importer, behind the US ($22 billion) and Japan ($15 billion).</p>

<p>A substantial amount of Chinese fishing occurs in waters far from China. According to the Stimson Center, China accounted for <a href="https://www.stimson.org/wp-content/files/file-attachments/Stimson%20Distant%20Water%20Fishing%20Report.pdf" rel="nofollow">38 percent</a> of all distant-water fishing (DWF) from 2016 to 2017. The average number of Chinese vessels engaging in DWF activity rose from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/greenpeace-sounds-alarm-over-chinas-long-distance-fishing-fleet" rel="nofollow">1,830</a> in 2012 to at least <a href="https://www.stimson.org/wp-content/files/file-attachments/Stimson%20Distant%20Water%20Fishing%20Report.pdf" rel="nofollow">3,000</a> in 2019. In 2017, Beijing released a <a href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2017-12/08/content_5245275.htm" rel="nofollow">plan</a>
 to cap the number of DWF vessels at 3,000 by 2020, but it remains to be
 seen whether the measures will be effective, or properly enforced.</p>
<p>Some Chinese DWF vessels have engaged in illegal, unreported, and 
unregulated (IUU) fishing. According to a two-year investigation by <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/7253/new-evidence-shows-chinese-west-african-governments-must-rein-in-rogue-fishing-fleet/" rel="nofollow">Green Peace</a>,
 Chinese boats have been found fishing illegally and falsifying their 
catch tonnage in the prohibited waters of Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea 
Bissau and other countries. In March 2016, the Argentina Coast Guard <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/16/argentina-sinks-chinese-trawler-during-pursuit-for-illegal-fishing" rel="nofollow">sank</a> a Chinese trawler that was reportedly fishing illegally in its waters.</p>
<p>Closer to China’s shores, overfishing has contributed to the severe depletion of fishery resources. The <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1000683.shtml" rel="nofollow">Chinese Ministry of Agriculture</a>
 has stated there are “practically no fish” in the East China Sea. In 
the South China Sea, Chinese poachers have devastated the delicate 
ecosystem. At Scarborough Shoal, fishermen intentionally destroyed 
roughly <a href="https://amti.csis.org/china-scarborough-fishing/" rel="nofollow">half the total reef surface</a> (approximately 58 square kilometers) in their efforts to harvest giant clams.</p>
<p>Rough Waters in the South China Sea: A Conversation with Greg Poling</p>
<p>In response to heightened pressure from the international community, 
the Chinese government has instituted several policy changes to protect 
the environment and stop IUU fishing. In January 2017, Hainan province <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/01/wildlife-watch-giant-clam-regulations-china/" rel="nofollow">amended its Coral Reef Protection Act</a> to ban the processing and trade of giant clams. To limit IUU fishing, China’s Ministry of Agriculture <a href="http://english.agri.gov.cn/news/dqnf/201901/t20190110_296194.htm" rel="nofollow">pledged</a>
 in January 2019 to deny known IUU fishing vessels access to Chinese 
ports. China’s fisheries law was also amended to include stricter

<p>Nevertheless, Chinese vessels continue to pose problems for other countries. In October 2016, a Chinese fishing boat <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2016/12/123_221165.html" rel="nofollow">rammed and sank</a> a South Korean Coast Guard boat, causing a diplomatic row that stalled bilateral efforts to crackdown on illegal fishing.</p>

 the disputed waters of the South China Sea, China has used its coast 
guard and maritime militia to intimidate foreign fishers and defend 
Chinese fishing vessels operating in contested waters. In June 2019, for

 a Philippine fishing boat in the South China Sea. Philippine 
authorities stated that the incident was part of an operation by the 
Chinese maritime militia designed to expel Philippine fishing boats from
 the Spratly Islands. </p>
