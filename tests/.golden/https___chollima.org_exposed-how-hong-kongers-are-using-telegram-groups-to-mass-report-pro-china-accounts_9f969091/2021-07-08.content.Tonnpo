<p>Hong Kong activists are using telegram groups to orchestrate the mass
 coordinated reporting of pro-China accounts in an effort to manipulate 
the platform. As identified by an account dubbed “<a href="https://twitter.com/wangchunghua/status/1293849788065095681">Joshua Wrong</a>“: it has been revealed that activists are running an organized effort known as the “五毛集中解決區” or the “<a href="https://t.me/s/wumaogaikyutkeoi">Twitter Wumao Centralized Resolution Area</a>“.
 Here, pro-China leaning accounts are identified, surveyed and 
instructed to be flagged under specific reasons by the group, organized 
by a bot. The effort has roughly 1800 members.</p>
<p>It describes itself as follows: “This channel is affiliated with 
@twittermansyunzou , which focuses on reporting all kinds of wumaos. 
Give priority to the wumaos with a large number of followers. Capture 
wild fifty cents can pm @WumaoGaiKyutKeoiBot</p>
<p> admins will put on the channel after reviewing, *please please fill in the link*”</p>
<p>How does this work? The group is aiming to carefully manipulate 
twitter’s algorithm by identifying given keywords which can be processed
 as a violation of the rules, and then to flag those given entry points 
in a large number in order to slap automated bans on the targeted 
account. As an example, on Wednesday the group zoned in action on the 
Chinese Hui Muslim Temur (based in Australia).</p>
<p>Having stated the word “warpig” in a tweet, the group admin clearly 
instructs underneath which twitter rule the comment is deemed to violate
 and thus what the group ought to follow on report. As a result, Temur 
was mass reported on August 12th for “hateful content” by at least 77 of
 its members.</p>
<p>The group has subsequently celebrated the accounts which it has got 
banned, including the Chinese Muslim Fatimah earlier in the given week:</p>
<p>The existence of such an organized effort to stifle dissenting voices
 is not surprisingly a huge violation of twitter’s “Platform 
manipulation policies”- and seems to be repeated in how activists also 
mass coordinate replies to China related news items, or given 
individuals. Never however, do we hear about any action being taken 
against these forms of accounts, as twitter assumes that only “state 
actors” can manipulate the platform.</p>
<p>Mainstream Journalists also happily ignore these efforts and refuse 
to report on them, nor do any “think tanks” consult with twitter on such
 blatant abuse of the system in the pursuit of political objectives.</p>
<p>Note: If you are a pro-China user, you must be careful to ensure you 
do not give the activists a “casus belli” to target you. To do so, 
ensure your twitter discourse is strictly civil. Avoid using any 
insults, foul language or rude words, even terms such as “Moron” are 
being spotted and flagged for mass targeting. Twitter has repeatedly 
demonstrated it is not a neutral or balanced arbiter on this issue and 
appears to favour their activities, innocence does not mean exoneration,
 hence the Chollima Report itself was previously banned.</p>
