<h1 class="rm-manual">China claims the “World Health Organization” said there was no coronavirus evidence in a laboratory</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">17/04/2020</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>By</span> <a href="https://conflict-news.com/author/anshi-gupta/">Anshi gupta</a></p>
<p><span>President Donald Trump said his administration was seeking to 
ascertain where the deadly disease had originated from and raised its 
sanctions against China over the coronavirus pandemic. State Secretary 
Mike Pompeo has also called on Beijing to “come clean” of what it knows.</span></p>
<p><span>On Wednesday, Trump was questioned at a White House news 
conference about stories of the virus escaping from a laboratory in 
Wuhan, where the coronavirus first appeared.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re really looking at this horrible thing that we’re doing, he said.</span></p>
<figcaption>China claims the “World Health Organization” said there was no coronavirus evidence in a laboratory</figcaption><p><span>When
 asked if in his conversations with President Xi Jinping he discussed 
this subject, Trump said: “I don’t want to speak about what I told him 
about the laboratory, I just don’t want to speak because it’s not 
necessary at the moment.” </span></p>
<p><span>At least 136,000 people worldwide have now died of the disease 
with nearly 31,000 in the United States alone. More than two million 
people were infected by the infection and at least half a million 
recovered.</span></p>
<p><span>Trump’s top diplomat, Pompeo, meanwhile, after Trump’s news 
conference, told Fox News Channel, “We believe this virus originated in 
Wuhan, China,” and noted that the Virology Institute was just a couple 
of miles from the city, where people first came down with the disease. 
“To open up the Chinese government we really need,” Pompeo said, trying 
to explain “exactly how this virus spreads.”</span></p>
<p><span>“We need to clear the left of this virus from the Chinese 
Government,” he said. The state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology has 
rejected claims that the virus might have been artificially synthesized 
at one of its laboratories or escaped as far back as February from its 
facility. </span></p>
<p class=""><span>The foreign ministry of China reported on Thursday 
that the World Health Organization said there was no coronavirus 
evidence in a laboratory. A spokesman for the ministry Zhao Lijian told 
reporters in Beijing that WHO officials “have said many times that there
 is no proof that the latest coronavirus was developed in a laboratory.”</span></p>
