<h1 class="rm-manual">Who’s Afraid of Talking With Kim Jong Un?</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2018 </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Americans should welcome President Trump’s apparent
 willingness to speak with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, but instead 
naysayers are warning of dire consequences, Jonathan Marshall explains.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">By Jonathan Marshall</p>
<p>Three months ago, I <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/11/30/whats-wrong-with-talking-to-north-korea/">quoted</a>
 approvingly Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to supporters in Atlanta 
that he would “absolutely” speak to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un even
 if there were only a “10 percent or a 20 percent chance that I can talk
 him out of those damn nukes.”</p>
<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>“What the hell is wrong with speaking?” the candidate said. “We should be eating a hamburger on a conference table.”</p>
<p>This week, the ever-mercurial President Trump agreed to take Kim up 
on a surprise offer to meet face-to-face in two months to search for 
peace. The meeting will be the first ever held between the leaders of 
the United States and North Korea, two countries that remain technically
 at war.</p>
<p>Whether the two men agree to eat hamburgers or kimchi, Americans 
should applaud Trump’s renewed willingness to talk rather than fight. 
Instead, all manner of naysayers are warning of potentially dire 
consequences. A few of their points have merit, but none outweigh the 
likely consequences of doing nothing to stop an impending war.</p>
<p>For the past year, the two leaders have communicated only by trading 
epithets like “Little Rocket Man” and “lunatic mean old trickster and 
human reject.” Such exchanges would be entertaining if President Trump 
had not also threatened to “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-un-north-korean-leader-suicide-mission-n802596">totally destroy</a>” North Korea and bring down “<a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/08/10/hurtling-toward-fire-and-fury/">fire and fury like the world has never seen</a>.”
 While Pyongyang has tested new warheads and missiles, Washington has 
been conducting war exercises and moving nuclear-capable stealth bombers
 and submarines within range of North Korea.</p>
<p>The Unacceptable Risk of War</p>
<p>In recent months, experts have put the odds of a catastrophic war—which would likely kill <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2018/02/07/no-time-for-complacency-over-korea-war-threat/">hundreds of thousands of Americans</a> in addition to countless Koreans and Japanese—at <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/america-isnt-the-brink-nuclear-war%E2%80%94it-just-looks-way-24010">between 25 and 50 percent</a>.
 President Trump’s foreign-policy adviser, Republican Sen. Lindsey 
Graham of South Carolina, said the likelihood of Trump launching a 
preemptive war will rise to 70 percent if North Korea conducts another 
nuclear test. “At the pace we’re on, it’s just a matter of time,” <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2018/01/sen-graham-just-a-matter-of-time-til-north-korean-redlines-crossed/">he added</a>.</p>
<p>Yet instead of hailing the prospect of talks as a great win for the 
life expectancy of people on both sides of the Pacific, some analysts 
insist on treating Kim’s proposal as a zero sum game.</p>
<p>“By some assessments, this is really a victory for Kim, who for years
 has sought proof of his status and North Korea’s power by dangling the 
offer of leader-to-leader talks with the United States,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-bellicosity-secures-a-diplomatic-coup--for-now/2018/03/08/7aaec368-2339-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html">writes</a> Karen DeYoung, senior national security correspondent for the Washington Post.</p>
<p>And liberal New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, while claiming that he is “all for negotiations,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/opinion/trump-north-korea-trip.html">focuses on</a>
 his “fear” that Trump “has given North Korea what it has long craved: 
the respect and legitimacy that comes from the North Korean leader 
standing as an equal beside the American president.”</p>
<p>Does Kristof really think peace will be easier to achieve by 
disrespecting Kim and insisting on his illegitimacy? Deep down, does 
Kristof care more about one-upmanship than preventing nuclear war?</p>
<p>Will Trump Flub the Deal?</p>
<p>Many critics also warn that North Korea will take advantage of 
Trump’s ignorance and lack of preparation to gain some unspecified 
advantage.</p>
<p>“President Trump’s infamous penchant for going off script and his 
admiration of authoritarian types could weaken our negotiating 
position,” declared Suzanne DiMaggio of the Washington-based New America
 Foundation, who helped arrange backdoor diplomatic contacts between the
 two countries last year.</p>
<p>Zack Beauchamp, a news analyst for Vox.com, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/9/17099916/trump-north-korea-meeting-announcement-kim-jong-un">warns</a>
 that Trump is “very easy to manipulate” and “easily swayed by 
flattery,” weaknesses that make it “easy to imagine the North Koreans 
tricking Trump into a deal that, in the long term, helps their strategic
 position while hurting America’s.”</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, senior White House and national security reporters for CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/politics/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html">caution</a>, “there’s a real chance Trump could be walking into a massive trap.”</p>
<p>Critics are right that Trump knows almost nothing about Korea. (“<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/international/328592-trump-on-north-korea-china-relations-i-realized-its-not-so-easy">It’s not so easy</a>,”
 he conceded last year, after talking with Chinese President Xi.) Trump 
has yet to appoint an ambassador to South Korea. The president doesn’t 
bother to talk with his Secretary of State, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-might-need-to-scramble-if-talks-with-n-korea-proceed/2018/03/08/dfddca4e-2312-11e8-a589-763893265565_story.html">said</a> only hours before the White House announcement, “We’re a long way from negotiations.” And <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/05/security-brief-mcmaster-on-the-way-out-putin-touts-new-nukes/">persistent reports</a> suggest that Trump’s national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, is on his way out—bad timing, if true.</p>
<p>But what is Trump likely to bargain away out of ignorance or vanity? 
Perhaps, critics fear, he will relax sanctions, agree to scale back 
military exercises with South Korea, or start exploring a long-term 
peace deal with North Korea before first nailing down iron-clad 
guarantees of North Korean nuclear disarmament.</p>
<p>But none of those measures would put the security of South Korea, 
much less the United States, at risk. No one seriously believes North 
Korea can win a conventional war. And its small arsenal of nuclear 
warheads is useful only for deterring a preemptive U.S. attack. Any 
other use would invite the total annihilation of North Korea.</p>
<p>The Danger of Overconfidence</p>
<p>One legitimate worry is that an unprepared Trump may engage in talks 
with false expectations of a quick PR victory, overconfident that 
economic sanctions have forced North Korea to the table.</p>
<p>“If Trump goes . . . and expects to announce a denuclearized North 
Korea, he will leave disappointed and maybe angry enough to believe that
 talks are useless and only military options are left,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/trump-kim-summit-has-pitfalls-to-dodge-first/2018/03/09/342e3b9e-2370-11e8-946c-9420060cb7bd_story.html">says</a> Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Trump needs to understand that Kim sees nuclear weapons as essential 
to his regime’s security. Dismantling his arsenal and opening up his 
country to intrusive inspections in order to ease sanctions would simply
 make his regime prey to a resumption of sanctions at a later 
date—without the benefit of a credible deterrent.</p>
<p>Kim will disarm, if ever, only after years of confidence-building, 
bolstered by guarantees from other powers, and after Washington signs a 
permanent peace treaty. The same conditions will doubtless be required 
before North Korea significantly liberalizes human rights.</p>
<p>Trump should go into the talks with the more modest but absolutely 
vital aim of heading off an impending war. Realistic near-term goals 
include freezing further missile and warhead testing by North Korea and 
eliciting guarantees against proliferation of North Korea’s technology 
to other countries.</p>
<p>To achieve those ends, he may need—in consultation with Seoul—to 
restrain U.S.-South Korean war exercises and partially relax sanctions. 
He and Kim should also map out a reasonable timetable for negotiating a 
final peace settlement between our countries. But Trump should refuse to
 let critics at home dissuade him from seeking an alternative to war.</p>

itself at war with a country it share no borders with whatsoever and is 
on a different continent nearly five thousand miles away. Yet 
governments and the media have brainwashed us into believing that this 
is acceptable behavior. I’ve commented on sites before that South Korea 
is effectively under occupation as its military forces are under the 
control of the U.S.. Some replies have challenge that assessment, but it
 is a fact, and no country that does not have complete control of its 
own military can be considered an independent democracy. The U.S. 
shouldn’t be in South Korea, as it could just as easily come to the 
country’s aid should North Korea mount an invasion. It is there because 
it likes to keep the Chinese on their toes, not because of Kim Jong Un. 
There are plenty of tyrannical dictators just as bad, or even worse, 
than Kim Jong Un. And some of them are much nearer to the U.S.. The

nature of doing something insensible and indecent. I have no trust in

 a second glance, I think that word “liberal” isn’t appropriate. This 
fellow’s Wiki says he was for the Iraq invasion. That he was in favor of
 the destruction of Libya. He’s against anti-sweatshop movements. Then 
there is this:</p> <blockquote class="rm-manual"><p class="rm-manual">Kristof
 contrasts “two Israels”: an oppressive security state in the 
Palestinian territories and a “paragon of justice, decency, fairness – 
and peace,” in the work of Israeli human rights activists, journalists,

 isn’t stupid enough to believe the “two Israels” BS is anything but 
fantasy. He’s a slick propagandist who has a handful of public stances 
like retaining Social Security and advocating universal health care. 
Since I believe even the nuttiest of the Trumpies would also be in favor
 of the first one, and the non-crazy ones liking the second, the 
overwhelming balance pushes Kristof right out of any “liberal” 
consideration. Far better to refer to the man as “a NYT columnist”.</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> Rob Nichols </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 12, 2018 at 20:17 </p> <p class="rm-manual">This

 fear of the deep state is if the North Korean threat is neutralized or 
otherwise dispelled that the military encirclement of Russia and China 
is greatly weakened. They really could care less about North Korea and 
may even prefer that North Korea retains its nuclear arsenal which 
provides an excuse for continuing the encirclement policy of Russia and 
China. Notice the absurd argument of the State department that 
anti-ballistic missile defense in Eastern Europe is intended to prevent a
 missile attack from North Korea.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> mike k </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 11, 2018 at 15:47 </p> <p class="rm-manual">It’s
 inevitable that a life and death showdown like this one with North

 short prayer of hope that it all goes well for peace in our troubled

 Tedesky, I think I forgot to press the Post Comment button yesterday 
when I remarked on the Pat Buchanan article you cited. I was halfway 
through repeating my comments today when it was wiped away, which I 
assume was my fault. Pat Buchanan sums up our foreign policy since the 
fall of the USSR as only he can. But I think the most important point I 
took from the article is our “our way or the highway” approachand that 
our foreign policy should always to seek accommodation where it is 
possible, i.e., to talk. I don’t know if he was specific on the matter, 
but I think he leads to the fact that our diplomatic language has grown 
courser. Obama, supposed the leader of the most powerful nation in the 
world except for its morality, felt compelled to insult and patronize

 should compare Kim Jong Un with Assad to clarify the situation. Trump 
and/or “Deep state” are mercelessly hostile toward Syrian predident, 
while he is very tolerant to Korean dictator despite his ostensibly 
verbal aggression. Historically, US gave excetional favors to North 
Korea, including KEDO program. Why? North Korea and its “communist” 
regime is essential for US to contain democratic or leftist movement and
 parties into a negligible space in Japan. The country have been serving
 as compelling excuse for US and Japan militaro-industry to build up 
huge weaponery and maitain military presence in Japan, in particular in 
Okinawa. Mr. Jonathan believes that Kim Jong Un will give up his nuclear
 ambition after many years of confidence-builing efforts. but after that

 Marshall, I’d like to offer a title for your next article: “The Worm 
Turns” Un (the worm) will get a bona fide peace treaty, in writing, when
 his a-bombs are in the hands of a neutral third party country, a 
country willing to accept, possesses technical know-how on 
security/storage, is capable of dismantling the weapons… Finland 
perhaps?, and by-the-way, not on their dime! For the sake of world 
peace, Russia, China and the USA must equally share the costs of 
financing this nuclear decommissioning process. The endeavor will be a 
new glasnost, where Un performs a sincere, public, mea culpa announcing 
his rejection of nukes, releasing political prisoners, accepting the 
mark of Cain for killing family members and bringing to full disclosure 
(with closure), those remaining issues such as kidnapping foreign 
nationals. A new glasnost, where the three (aforementioned) great 
powers, begin a slow process; reduce inter-state animosities, announcing
 a mutually agreed to, formal treaty, resolving the Korean crisis. To 
carefully prepare and set a timeline for the creation of democracy, or 
semblance thereof, for North Korea. I can already hear the bruxism in 
the mouths of Un and the CCP, all the way across the Pacific…It somewhat
 surprises me that this crisis, just may prove to be a catalyst that 
brings east and west together on grave matters such as hyper-sonic 
weapons, launch-on-warning, artificial intelligence in weaponry, nuclear
 weapons proliferation and maritime privileges (both on the surface and 
mining the ocean floor). A last chance! CONSORTIUMNEWS readers, will the
 Western Occident take it? Un, will you take that last chance? to 
confess your political sins, repent by cooperation with international 
arbitration or will you accept the alternate, easy way, a generous 
buy-out, just as the Americans provided to Saddam’s generals and their 
close family members? Did someone say a big Dasha in Switzerland? with a
 even bigger entourage of security personnel for the sake of your 
“divine” protection Un?</p><p class="rm-manual"> As our POTUS would surely say, let’s make a deal!</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> Realist </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2018 at 20:46 </p> <p class="rm-manual">North
 Korea gives up its nukes only if Washington agrees to shut down its 
garrisons and totally withdraw from the Korean peninsula, which is not 
going to happen because America will never be willing to relinquish that
 threat to China. If North Korea disarms and allows the Americans to 
stay in South Korea, they will be overrun in short order no matter what 
promises Washington makes. Washington has proven to be a liar time and 
again. Just ask Putin, Mr. Kim. </p> <p class="rm-manual">The best 
possible agreement the parties can realistically make is to promise not 
to launch a first strike against the other. Again, see the caveat above 
about America keeping promises or adhering to treaties. Moreover, 
Washington has never been willing to make such a no-strike promise, not 
even to Russia or China. The most realistic prediction is that nothing 
substantive can come of the meeting. Washington is basically asking the 
North Korean government to commit suicide. I can’t believe they would 
actually expect it to happen. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Right now, 
Trump’s advisors are agonising over how they will explain the big 
nothing burger, that is this meeting, to be served up to the American 
people. I’m sure it will be something along the lines of, see, we were 
flexible and those commies were intransigent, as always. They only 
understand force. In a best-case scenario, maybe they will opt for the 
false promises of no first strike, but that will be roundly condemned by
 the bipartisan war mongers as appeasement and selling out, perhaps even
 treason.</p> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> Joe Tedesky </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 11, 2018 at 00:57 </p> <p class="rm-manual">That’s why for all the reasons you stated Realist I believe Kim Jung un May feel safe under Putin’s defensive umbrella.</p> <p class="rm-manual">“I
 should note that our military doctrine says Russia reserves the right 
to use nuclear weapons solely in response to a nuclear attack, or an 
attack with other weapons of mass destruction against the country or its
 allies, or an act of aggression against us with the use of conventional
 weapons that threaten the very existence of the state. This all is very
 clear and specific.</p> <p class="rm-manual">As such, I see it is my 
duty to announce the following. Any use of nuclear weapons against 
Russia or its allies, weapons of short, medium or any range at all, will
 be considered as a nuclear attack on this country. Retaliation will be 
immediate, with all the attendant consequences.” Vladimir Putin, 
Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly 2018</p> <p class="rm-manual">Take note of how Putin’s use of the word allies is in reference to Russia’s strategic defense is added. </p> <p class="rm-manual">It’s
 for this reason I believe Kim Jung un is relaxing his own missile 
program. I could be wrong, but you must admit the timing is a bit 
uncanny. Joe</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> Realist </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 11, 2018 at 03:31 </p> <p class="rm-manual">Yes,
 Joe, I remember I wrote a response to Putin’s remarks directed at 
“allies,” the identity of whom I questioned at the time. I opined that I
 could see Russia going to all out war with Washington if Ukraine, Iran,
 Syria, Lebanon or other bordering countries–as in the Caucuses, 
including places like Georgia, Ossetia, Abkhazia, &amp; Armenia–were 
attacked or occupied by American troops. I was skeptical that he’d do 
the same for North Korea, leaving that responsibility to China. If 
things started going badly for China v Washington, I thought he’d 
probably have to step in–first issue warnings and only later taking 
action to keep China from being defeated, because if they were, the war 
wouldn’t end there. It would be the day Uncle Sam attempts to settle all
 family business. </p> <p class="rm-manual">The young Mr. Kim may be 
making assumptions if he thinks Putin’s remarks were enough of a 
guarantee to give up his nukes without any meaningful reciprocal action 
by Washington. To me, that would have to mean withdrawing all those 
American troops and missiles from his border. White man speak with 
forked tongue all the time and those troops could be in Pyongyang in a 
day without a reliable deterrent. </p> <p class="rm-manual">If I were 
he, I wouldn’t count on Russia risking WWIII to save my regime, 
especially upon seeing America in the throes of war fever. I’m not sure 
I’d trust China to do so either, if Washington was at Defcon 1. I think 
Saker has a pretty good finger on the pulse of Putin’s geopolitical 
philosophy, which, he says, is highly conservative and 
non-confrontational, putting highest priority on avoiding direct 
conflict with the United States. Any pushing and shoving you do see is 
on the part of Uncle Sam. I can’t see Putin giving Kim assurances that 
would be sure to outrage Washington. The cost/benefit ratio is just too 
unfavorable for Russia.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> mike k </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2018 at 16:46 </p> <p class="rm-manual">As
 in many affairs, the solution is simple and obvious: Withdraw all 
American troops from Korea, and let North and South solve their problems
 without our interference. But as is usual, the US with it’s plans of 
global domination refuses to consider the only real solution for Korea. 
We are making a mess everywhere we go in the world today, and the only 
viable answer is for us to leave other countries alone, and mind our own
 business. At some point we decided that we had to interfere in the 
world to get it the way we wanted it. We were wrong, and we need to

 believe that Trump is taking a step in the right direction if peace and
 disarmament were the primary objective. Last year, “Carter wrote that 
his more than 20 years’ worth of experience in dealing with the North 
taught him that what the country’s leadership wants more than anything 
is direct talks with the US that would lead to a permanent peace 
treaty.” According to David Swanson, there are at least 5 reasons to 
stop any war: war is immoral, endanger all of us, threatens our 
environment, erodes our liberties, and impoverishes us. Personally, I 
hope president Trump achieves a comprehensive peace treaty for war would
 be catastrophic for both Koreas. If he pulled it off, history will be 
kind to Trump.</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="http://www.bobherrschaft.com/Bob_Herrschafts_Cyber_Space/WELCOME.html" rel="external nofollow ugc">BobH</a> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2018 at 13:00 </p> <p class="rm-manual">Good

 own take on this Korean dilemma is that the U.S. Arms Industry is not

the South, that if these two nations divided by war can make a long

 see this negotiating with N Korea by the U.S. as a sign of there being a
 change in the world’s power dynamics. The U.S. will never admit defeat 
by Russia’s announced new weapons program, but I see Kim’s reaching out 
as his offer to de-escalate could be reaffirmed by Russia having Kim’s 
back covered. I could be wrong, but if you connect the dots of all this 
that has come to be between then S Korea’s diplomacy with the North

 up his nukes if certain criteria is met, makes me all the more curious 
to how much Putin’s announcement on March 1st of Russia’s advancement of
 their weapons program coupled with his promise to protect Russia’s 
allies doesn’t hold sway over Kim’s proposal. I mean if Kim Jung un has 
Russia watching his back, then why would Kim need his own firepower.

it easier.</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> Michael Kenny </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2018 at 09:07 </p> <p class="rm-manual">All
 this is very bad news for Vladimir Putin. Whatever comes out of Trump’s
 talks, the meeting will look like, and be depicted as, a US 
capitulation. Trump needs a war to validate his presidency. He has 
scrubbed China off his list, now he’s scrubbing North Korea. Next stop, 
probably, Iran, but at that point, he’s already fighting Putin.</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> David G </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2018 at 08:49 </p> <p class="rm-manual">Lying,
 crooked, racist ass though he be, Trump’s appeal as a candidate was not
 *entirely* down to appealing to the worst in people. His crude, 
scattershot gasbaggery all too frequently seemed troublingly sensible 
when contrasted with the monolithic (and belligerent) Beltway consensus 
we are supposed to take as reality. </p> <p class="rm-manual">After the 
election, that interestingly subversive quality almost entirely 
disappeared, with Trump’s residual non-conformism restricted to 
generalized chaos and such charming eccentricities as a balanced view of
 the KKK.</p> <p class="rm-manual">But in recent days candidate Trump 
seems to be reasserting himself, first with the tariffs (on which I am 
not taking a position), and now with Korea (which I think is great).</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 fact is that the door to radically reducing the risk of military 
confrontation in Korea has been wide open since at least the 1990s. Bill
 Clinton began to get somewhere, but progress was undermined by the U.S.
 Congress, and then abandoned by Bush Jr., with Obama happily emulating 
the reviled Repub rather than the popular Dem. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Now Trump, after wasting a year on stupid insults, seems to be on the verge of clumsily staggering through that open door. </p> <p class="rm-manual">It’s
 always foolish to bank on Donald Trump – just ask the many creditors he
 has stiffed over the years. But I am glad to take the all-too-rare 
opportunity to celebrate some good news, while it lasts. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Go, dotard, go!</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> David G </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2018 at 08:16 </p> <p class="rm-manual">Good piece by Jonathan Marshall – a reasonable look at several aspects of the situation. Thanks.</p> <p class="rm-manual">A few specific reactions:</p> <p class="rm-manual">*****</p> <p class="rm-manual">“In
 recent months, experts have put the odds of a catastrophic war … at 
between 25 and 50 percent. … Sen. Lindsey Graham … said the likelihood 
of Trump launching a preemptive war will rise to 70 percent if North 
Korea conducts another nuclear test.”</p> <p class="rm-manual">• As 
dispiriting as the recent hostile verbiage from Trump and Kim has been, I
 for one haven’t ever felt we were moving appreciably closer to war. 
However, if the terrifying Graham were in charge I might have to 
re-evaluate that position.</p> <p class="rm-manual">*****</p> <p class="rm-manual">“And
 liberal New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, while claiming that 
he is “all for negotiations,” focuses on his ‘fear’ that Trump ‘has 
given North Korea what it has long craved: the respect and legitimacy 
that comes from the North Korean leader standing as an equal beside the 
American president.'”</p> <p class="rm-manual">• It must be galling to 
Kristof that the DPRK is too strong to get the benefit of the kind of 
“humanitarian” destruction he cheered on in Libya.</p> <p class="rm-manual">*****</p> <p class="rm-manual">“And persistent reports suggest that Trump’s national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, is on his way out—bad timing, if true.”</p> <p class="rm-manual">•
 I don’t know where McMaster stands on Korea, but since he is 
fanatically anti-Iran – where I am much more concerned the U.S. &amp; 
friends will start a war in the near term than Korea – I say good 
riddance, if true.</p> <p class="rm-manual">*****</p> <p class="rm-manual">“Realistic near-term goals include freezing further missile and warhead testing by North Korea …”</p> <p class="rm-manual">•
 After its latest missile test, the DPRK said it considered its 
strategic deterrent as now being complete. Credible observers saw this 
as signaling a cessation of further provoking nuclear and missile tests.
 If that’s correct, and if the North’s negotiators are smart (and they 
definitely are), they should be able to get some concessions out of the 
U.S. in exchange for confirming a decision they have already de facto 
taken. </p> <p class="rm-manual">*****</p> <p class="rm-manual">“Whether the two men agree to eat hamburgers or kimchi …”</p> <p class="rm-manual">• Kimchi burgers! We’ve got to look for the win-win.</p> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> Pamela </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2018 at 11:03 </p> <p class="rm-manual">Kimchi burgers.

 concern is that Trump has too much invested in his image as the great 
deal maker, and will be too demanding of a totally lopsided deal from 
Kim, which he will not get. In that case he could become violent, and 
feel justified in starting a shooting war.</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> David G </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2018 at 09:13 </p> <p class="rm-manual">I can’t say that’s not a valid concern, mike k. But two things:</p> <p class="rm-manual">First,
 I wouldn’t lose too much sleep over what might go down at a 
face-to-face Trump/Kim summit, which I’d say is still more likely to not
 take place. </p> <p class="rm-manual">And wherever this leads, I credit
 the highly proficient DPRK negotiators with being able to suss out what
 Trump needs both politically and psychologically so as to make the most

 G, (this is a re-post, first time failed) On a more serious note and 
aside from the dotard chuckle: While surfing the many Hiroshima bombing 
websites, I stumbled on a 1945 picture of a little Japanese girl who’s 
eyes were completely burned out-(from atomic flash), they resembled 
charcoal cinders. The photo really Hit Me Hard and the immediate 
reaction was, yes, first strike!! their children instead of ours! After 
sleeping on it, the next morning, emotional reaction gave way to the 
thought, NO CHILDREN, ANYWHERE should suffer this horror ! Our POTUS 
must now do all that is within his power to, bribe, ingratiate, woo, 
even swindle, Un, and if necessary intimidate him into dismantling or 
surrendering that nuclear weapons stockpile. During the last days of the
 Nixon administration, he (Nixon) was hitting the bottle pretty hard, 
walking around the WH in the nude. Now the archives reveal that 
Kissinger (HK) made secret agreements with pentagon top brass, that in 
light of these lapses in clear judgement (putting it tactfully) to 
dismiss any attack orders by Nixon. My point is, unfortunately, Un loves
 to guzzle Hennessy cognac and does not have an HK figure (that I’m 
aware of anyway) with authority to intervene or countermand a drunken 
command to attack Seoul. It wouldn’t take much provocation, such as the 
disappearance or sinking of a few fishing vessels for an outburst of 
“fire and fury” from the mouth of that, food and drink debauched, 
Supreme Leader ! Does Un hand over the car keys to his generals (nuclear
 codes) before he hits the bar? Nobody really knows and it only raises 
the urgency of the matter…</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> Sam F </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2018 at 19:30 </p> <p class="rm-manual">Yes,
 talking is the correct path, and likely they cannot blow up in person, 
nor later if congenial in person. Plus talks with NK may be a necessary 
prelude to talks with Russia. The Trump growling may silence the right 
wing and lead to peace after all. Maybe another growl at Russia before 
talks.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> Larry Gates </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2018 at 08:10 </p> <p class="rm-manual">It
 is rare but occasionally Trump does the right thing, and agreeing to 
talk with Kim Jong Un is a step in the right direction. Let’s hope he 
tells Nikki Haley to shut her damn mouth while the talks are going on, 
And let’s hope that he treats Kim Jong Un with respect and has awareness
 that the North Korean leader.is simply trying to prevent his country 
from being devastated like it was in the early 50s. Probably won’t 
happen, but it could be like Nixon going to China or Reagan ending the 
cold war. Too much to hope for, I suppose.</p><p class="rm-manual"> 
Actually, it would be easy to get North Korea to disarm. Just pull the 
American troops out of Korea, promise not to invade, and allow North and
 South Korea to continue their peace talks. Unfortunately, I can’t 
imagine Trump or even a Democrat doing that.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> journey80 </p> <p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2018 at 09:46 </p> <p class="rm-manual">Especially

peace anywhere on the planet has been discredited so many times it would
 be comical if it were not so suicidal. We need a second party. The two
