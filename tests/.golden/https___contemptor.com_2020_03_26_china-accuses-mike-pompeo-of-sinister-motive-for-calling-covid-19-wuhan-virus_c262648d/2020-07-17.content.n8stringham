<h1 class="rm-manual">China Accuses Mike Pompeo of ‘Sinister Motive’ for Calling Covid-19 ‘Wuhan Virus’</h1>
<ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://contemptor.com/author/droche/">Darragh Roche</a> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://contemptor.com/2020/03/26/china-accuses-mike-pompeo-of-sinister-motive-for-calling-covid-19-wuhan-virus/">March 26, 2020</a> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://contemptor.com/2020/03/26/china-accuses-mike-pompeo-of-sinister-motive-for-calling-covid-19-wuhan-virus/">0</a> </li> </ul>
<p>The Chinese government has responded angrily to Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo’s insistence on calling Covid-19 the ‘Wuhan Virus’. Amid a 
global pandemic, Pompeo has repeatedly referred to the disease using a 
term the World Health Organization has advised against.</p>
<p>Pompeo <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/489484-pompeo-pressed-g7-leaders-to-refer-to-wuhan-virus-in-statement-report">pushed for Coronavirus to be known as Wuhan Virus</a>
 during a virtual meeting of the G7 foreign ministers. This reportedly 
led the leading industrial nations to decline to issue a joint statement
 on the situation. Pompeo has been consistent in using the term.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang <a href="https://apnews.com/d8d31ae73b1d44146d5077fe3fa9ba8c">accused Pompeo</a>
 on Thursday of trying to ‘stigmatize China and discredit China’s 
efforts in an attempt to divert attention and shift responsibilities.’</p>
<p>“He has a very sinister motive,” Geng told journalists at a briefing.</p>
<p>Pompeo <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/489605-china-pompeo-has-sinister-motive-for-pushing-wuhan-virus-language">criticized China on Wednesday</a> and made particular reference to the fact that China is a Communist, one-party state.</p>
<p>“We’ve wanted to work with the Chinese Communist Party throughout 
this crisis — this crisis that began in Wuhan, China,” Pompeo said.</p>
<p>“We tried, you’ll remember, from the opening days to get our 
scientists, our experts on the ground there so that we could begin to 
assist in the global response to what began there in China, but we 
weren’t able to do that. The Chinese Communist Party wouldn’t permit 
that to happen.”</p>
<p>President Donald Trump and his surrogates have repeatedly insisted 
that terms like ‘Wuhan Virus’ and ‘China Virus’ are not racist, while 
the Chinese government has been particularly sensitive about its own 
handling of the disease.</p>
