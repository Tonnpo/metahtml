<h1 class="rm-manual">Local Heroes: People Helping People During the Coronavirus Crisis</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>By</span> <a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/author/christinevantuyl/">Christine Van Tuyl</a></p>
<p class="rm-manual">03/27/2020</p>
<p class="">I’ve always loved this quote from Mr. Rogers. “When I was a 
boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me,
 ‘Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.’”</p>
<p>Coronado is full of helpers during this unprecedented time of fear 
and panic. We have doctors and nurses working the front lines, tending 
to the ill. We have kind-hearted neighbors who are willing to drop 
everything to pick up groceries and run errands for the high-risk among 
us. We have community coordinators, creating platforms to help and 
assist in spreading joy, ultimately boosting the spirit of those 
depleted in hope.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of many Coronado locals who are doing wonderful things to help others.</p>
<p>Rebecca Sauer, critical care nurse. Nominated by a local woman who 
wishes to remain anonymous, for sharing her expertise and helping a 
high-risk individual obtain a safety mask.</p>
<figcaption>Rebecca Sauer, a critical care nurse at UCSD.</figcaption><p>“Rebecca
 posted her number on Coronado Happenings for anyone who might need 
help, so I called her for advice,” explains the woman. “My husband has 
stage 4 cancer and I have respiratory issues, and my husband had to go 
in for lab work and an infusion at Kaiser.” The woman was very worried 
about her husband picking up the virus, and also bringing it back home 
to her. “It’s been a long journey with his illness, and my own issues 
coming into play in the last several months,” says the woman. “Ten 
minutes later, Rebecca called me with a top-of-the-line of respiratory 
mask with filters my husband could wear on his visit to keep him safe.”</p>
<p>Rebecca also helped the woman come up with a safety plan when her 
husband returned home, so the couple would not have to spend time apart.
 “I burst into tears at her efforts to help us, it’s so unbelievable and
 we are so grateful. She is an angel and has helped us so much with this
 world-wide coronavirus challenge.”</p>
<p>Bill Rogers, founder of Liberty Call Distilling. Nominated by John 
Sexton and Heather Dueitt for making and distributing hand sanitizers to
 those in need.</p>
<figcaption>Bill Rogers, founder of Liberty Call Distilling.</figcaption><p>“I
 want to give a shout out and a ‘cheers’ to Bill Rogers of Liberty Call 
Distilling,” says John Sexton. “He has made efforts and convinced 
distilleries to join him and delay production of their spirits to make 
and distribute hand sanitizer to agencies like the Los Angeles Police 
Department, the Orange County Fire Department, the Chino Hills Fire 
Department, sixteen Amazon fulfillment centers in California, and senior
 healthcare centers.”</p>
<p>Bill also helped a local senior in need.</p>
<p>“Bill has been helping donate sanitizer to Nado residents that needed
 it the most,” says Heather Dueitt. “He dropped some off to a friend who
 is caring for a 90-year-old at the Shores and ran out.”</p>
<p>Debra Cordell-Smith, retired Air Force veteran. Nominated by Noelani Mingo for random acts of kindness.</p>
<figcaption>Debra Cordell-Smith, now a retired Air Force veteran.</figcaption><p>“With
 the chaos of COVID 19, I’ve been hesitant to leave our home,” explains 
Noelani. “When I finally ventured out in search of groceries and 
toiletries, stopping at several stores over a span of three hours, I 
received a message from Deb checking in to see how my day was going. I 
explained my morning and shared that after multiple stops I failed to 
find any toilet paper and was headed home. Without hesitation, she 
offered me an 18 pack of toilet paper, refused payment, and asked if 
there was anything else we needed. Deb is not only an outstanding 
neighbor, and a caring friend, she is a disabled Air Force veteran and 
military spouse. Her service to our country and her kindness and 
generosity inspires me.”</p>
<p>Jay Doucet, MD, FRCSC, FACS. Nominated by Lourdes Smith Huidor, for 
his work fighting the COVID-19 virus in his leadership role at UC San 
Diego Health.</p>
<figcaption>Jay Doucet, MD, FRCSC, FACS. Image courtesy of UC San Diego Health.</figcaption><p>“I
 nominate Jay Doucet who is fighting this current war against the 
invisible enemy from the frontlines as a surgeon, educator and leader,” 
says Lourdes. “Dr. Doucet and his team are working around the clock 
caring for patients, the community, and in developing protocols and 
safety measures to better assist with the process.”</p>
<p>Maggie Pettit, local mom and Coronado Village Elementary PTO 
President. Nominated by Julie Dabbieri, for spreading light and cheer.</p>
<figcaption>Maggie Pettit with her family.</figcaption><p>“The first 
week of quarantine, she organized a nightly 6:45pm ‘wave’ on our block,”
 explains Julie. “This is somewhat of a highlight for all of us, kids 
and adults!”</p>
<p>Maggie has also organized children’s chalk walks, window walks, and 
led other efforts helping kids spread color and happiness to their 
neighbors.</p>
<p>Rashida Cooper and her staff at the Youth Center at Lincoln Military 
Housing at Silver Strand. Nominated by Jennifer Moore, for caring for 
children of essential employees with the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>“Rashida and her staff are truly unsung heroes and our partners in 
educating, championing, and loving many military-connected students at 
Silver Strand,” says Jennifer. “Many people do not know that this 
facility serves students TK through 12th grade before and after school 
(early and late hours) and including on holidays. As essential employees
 they have been working full-time while our schools are closed and while
 their parents, also essential employees, serve our country. During 
regular school days I am witness to a warm hand-offs between our staff 
and theirs before and after school….I hope that you will recognize their
 tremendous service to our community and nation…and the future leaders 
of our country!”</p>
<p>Dr. Wael Kouli, Plastic Surgeon. Nominated by Ian Van Tuyl, for stitching up a bad cut on the fly.</p>
<figcaption>Dr. Kouli of Esthetica San Diego.</figcaption><p>“I broke my
 coffee cup and ended up cutting my hand pretty badly,” says Ian. “I 
knew I needed stitches, but didn’t want to visit the emergency room with
 everything that was going on. My wife texted Dr. Kouli and he responded
 within minutes, meeting us in the alley behind his offices to stitch up
 my hand while I sat in the passenger seat of my car. I can’t thank him 
enough for his care.”</p>
<p>Kelley Kraft Casey, social media rockstar. Nominated by Rebecca 
Sauer, for creating the Coronado Coronavirus Help- People Helping People
 Facebook page.</p>
<figcaption>Photographer, writer, and social media guru Kelley Kraft Casey.</figcaption><p>“I
 would like to sincerely thank Kelley Kraft Casey for starting this 
group,” says Rebecca Sauer. “Because of this group, a very nice lady was
 able to reach out to me, with serious medical concerns that put her and
 her husband at critical risk if infected. A neighbor, who is a 
contractor, provided me with an industrial grade filtration mask, that I
 was able to give her. This may mean the difference between them having 
to self-isolate apart for weeks, versus being able to stay together. 
This forum did that.”</p>
<p>Lisa Solis, singer, musician and music teacher. Nominated by Renata Escalante for spreading music and joy.</p>
<figcaption>Lisa Solis teaching music class with a young student.</figcaption><p>“I
 nominate Lisa Solis for her energy, her spirit and her beautiful soul,”
 says Renata. “She’s keeping the moms and dads and babies connected 
through her music through social media.”</p>
<p>Lisa has created a <a href="file:///groups/889074641543549/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Music with Miss Lisa FaceBook Page</a>
 to offer Family Music Time via Facebook Live every Monday, Wednesday 
and Friday at 10am. She hopes to inspire a musical experience between 
parents and their children, and incorporate how household articles can 
be used as instruments. No tuition or donation required!</p>
<p>Nick and Liz Merrill, and the trainers at Sweat Equity. Nominated by 
Colby Freer, for keeping morning workouts alive and connecting the 
community through daily Zoom group workouts.</p>
<figcaption>Nick and Liz Merrill, owners of Sweat Equity Gym.</figcaption><p>“As
 a full-time mortgage loan officer working remote, mom of two little 
creatures and running a household, you really help ‘keep the wheels 
on!'” says Colby. “I know there are many of us in these similar roles 
and I appreciate you both for your commitment to this community. I want 
to recognize your generosity and express my deepest appreciation! You 
keep my mind clear, my emotions more stable and my body from becoming 
total mush! Each morning I set up my workouts on my porch that faces the
 sunrise, pop in my ear buds, and get pumped that I get to workout with 
you and other fellow Sweat Equity members.”</p>

<p class="">Christine was born and raised in Texas, but moved to 
Coronado with her family as a teen in 1993. Although initially horrified
 by surfers, flannels and skateboards, she ultimately grew to love all 
things So-Cal. A graduate of UCSD, Christine got her first writing job 
on the KUSI ten o’clock news while simultaneously juggling a reporter 
position at the San Diego Community News Group. She worked as a public 
relations professional, a book editor, real estate professional, and a 
freelance writer before eventually succumbing to motherhood in 2008.A 
decade later, Christine resurfaced to start the Island Girl Blog, a 
Coronado lifestyle blog. In addition, she writes a monthly page for 
Crown City Magazine. Christine loves hanging out with her husband, Ian, 
and their two spirited daughters, Holland and Marley, who attend Village
 Elementary and Coronado Middle School. When she’s not working, you’ll 
find her practicing yoga, spilling coffee at school drop off, meeting 
friends for sushi, or sailing the Bay with her family and English 
Bulldog, Moshi. Have news to share? Send tips, story ideas or letters to
