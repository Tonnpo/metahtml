<h1 class="rm-manual">QIAGEN announces worldwide shipments of QIAstat-Dx test kits for SARS-CoV-2</h1>
<h2 class="rm-manual">• QIAstat-Dx Respiratory 2019-nCoV Panel rapidly 
differentiates novel coronavirus from 21 other pathogens implicated in 
serious respiratory syndromes • Panel being tested at four hospitals in 
China after initial evaluation on clinical samples by a leading Paris 
hospital • Adds to QIAGEN’s portfolio of molecular testing solutions to 
aid in global public health emergency</h2>
<p><span>Hilden, Germany, and Germantown, Maryland, February 26, 2020 –</span><span>
 QIAGEN (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) today announced it 
has shipped its newly developed QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel 2019-nCoV 
test kit to four hospitals in China for evaluation. The new kit detects 
the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and adds rapid Sample to Insight 
syndromic testing to QIAGEN’s portfolio of molecular testing solutions 
in the public health emergency. QIAGEN is also in the process of 
shipping QIAstat-Dx testing kits to public health institutions in other 
regions, including Europe, South-East Asia, and the Middle East. </span></p>
<p><span>Since January QIAGEN has been providing instruments and 
consumables to support detection of the virus in China and other 
markets. Official protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection include QIAGEN 
extraction kits, reagents and instruments for real-time polymerase chain
 reaction (RT-PCR) workflows. Customers also are deploying QIAsymphony 
modular instruments and NeuMoDx integrated PCR systems to automate 
higher-throughput processing of their laboratory-developed tests for 
SARS-CoV-2.</span></p>
<p><span>“Our dedicated task force has moved very fast to develop and 
make available the QIAstat-Dx respiratory panel with SARS-CoV-2 
detection. We are partnering closely with authorities and customers 
around the world to bring rapid, accurate diagnosis to the fight against
 this deadly infectious disease,” said Thierry Bernard, Interim CEO of 
QIAGEN and Senior Vice President, Head of the Molecular Diagnostics 
Business Area. “As we have in past health crises such as SARS and the 
swine flu, QIAGEN is working hard to deliver better, faster testing 
solutions for hospitals and public health institutions to aid in the 
effort to monitor and bring the outbreak under control. Our employees’ 
extraordinary response embodies QIAGEN’s core mission to make 
improvements in life possible.”</span></p>
<p><span>The QIAstat-Dx system was introduced in Europe in 2018 as a CE-product and cleared by the </span><span>Food and Drug Administration (FDA) </span><span>in
 the United States in mid-2019. It enables fast, cost-effective and 
easy-to-use syndromic testing with novel Sample to Insight workflows. 
The system streamlines molecular testing from end to end. A technician 
simply loads a clinical sample (such as a swab) into a single-use 
QIAstat-Dx cartridge and places it in the analyzer. QIAGEN chemistries 
for sample processing and analysis are built in, and the QIAstat-Dx 
instrument delivers results in about one hour.</span></p>
<p><span>New QIAstat-Dx testing solution for SARS-CoV-2</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><span>QIAstat-Dx Respiratory </span><span>2019-nCoV Panel <span>is
 a new version of the existing QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel for 
differential analysis of 21 viral and bacterial pathogens in respiratory
 syndromes. </span></span><span>Once the SARS-CoV-2 genome was sequenced
 in January, QIAGEN developed two highly sensitive assays to detect 
SARS-CoV-2 targeting ORF1b and the E gene. The addition of these targets
 provides parallel tools for combined detection of the novel coronavirus
 with increased sensitivity.</span></p>
<p><span>The expanded QIAstat-Dx panel is currently being evaluated at 
the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris. “After more than a year of 
experience using the existing QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel to evaluate 
patients coming into our Emergency Department with respiratory 
syndromes, we are evaluating the new panel with SARS-CoV-2 against 
RT-PCR testing using WHO recommended protocols. The QIAstat-Dx solution 
can provide results in about one hour, with high sensitivity and 
specificity and minimal hands-on time for hospital or laboratory 
personnel,” said Dr. Benoit Visseaux, Associate Professor of Virology at
 Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris.</span></p>
<p><span>Amid the rapidly evolving response to the coronavirus outbreak, the regulatory status of t</span><span>he </span><span>QIAstat-Dx
 Respiratory Panel will vary by location. QIAGEN will apply for 
emergency authorization for marketing of the new panel from the U.S., 
the Korean KCDC/MFDS, and FDA and China’s National Medical Products 
Administration (NMPA); the panel will be available with CE-IVD marking 
in Europe and other markets.</span></p>
<p><span>Multiple other QIAGEN testing solutions for SARS-CoV-2</span></p>
<p><span>QIAGEN has moved quickly on several fronts to provide molecular
 testing solutions to researchers working to counter the international 
threat from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Building on its strong position and 
experience in molecular testing for infectious diseases, QIAGEN is 
providing a variety of solutions:</span></p>
<ul> <li><span>Enabling laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) – extraction 
kits, PCR enzymes and instruments, supporting in-house testing by 
laboratories and public health institutions. CDC guidelines for RT-PCR 
testing list QIAGEN’s EZ1 DSP Virus kits, which run on EZ1 Advanced 
workstations, and QIAamp DSP Viral RNA Mini kits, which can be automated
 on QIAcube instruments. Chinese authorities and the Berlin Charitè 
protocol also include QIAGEN consumables. </span></li> <li><span>Mid- 
and high-throughput automation – QIAsymphony modular systems for sample 
preparation and PCR analysis, as well as NeuMoDx 96 and 288 systems for 
fully integrated PCR analysis, enabling customers to implement 
higher-throughput solutions for laboratory-developed RT-PCR tests. 
QIAGEN recently started placing NeuMoDx systems in China, for use in 
with LDTs in SARS-CoV-2 testing.</span></li> <li><span>Additional 
real-time PCR tests – two new RT-PCR tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 
have been developed at QIAGEN sites in China and the United States and 
will be available for Research Use Only. The company is investigating 
potential emergency use options for the automated PCR-based test 
solutions.</span></li> </ul>
