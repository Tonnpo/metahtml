<h1 class="rm-manual">QIAGEN gains BARDA funding for approval process of QIAstat-Dx test kit for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus </h1>
<h2 class="rm-manual">• First syndromic testing solution to get U.S. 
agency’s development support in novel coronavirus response • QIAstat-Dx 
Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel test kit will rapidly differentiate novel 
coronavirus from 21 other pathogens implicated in respiratory syndromes •
 Further expanding QIAGEN’s global mobilization to scale up testing 
supplies for the COVID-19 response</h2>
<p><span>Hilden, Germany, and Germantown, Maryland, March 13, 2020 –</span><span>
 QIAGEN (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) today announced it 
will develop a new QIAstat-Dx test kit to differentiate the novel 
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus from 21 other serious respiratory infections and 
will receive advanced development support from the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Preparedness and Response (ASPR). Accelerated development of the 
QIAstat-Dx test kit further expands QIAGEN’s global mobilization for the
 emergency, which already includes a dramatic increase in production of 
components for a full range of U.S. and international testing protocols.</span></p>
<p><span>QIAGEN’s QIAstat-Dx solution to help in the response to 
COVID-19 disease becomes the first syndromic testing product selected 
for development through ASPR's Biomedical Advanced Research and 
Development Authority (BARDA) streamlined selection process, known as an
 easy broad agency announcement (EZ-BAA). BARDA will contribute $598,000
 to accelerate QIAGEN's evaluation of the testing cartridge that detects
 the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span>The QIAstat-Dx kit will be a molecular testing panel designed 
to aid in the diagnosis of patients with respiratory syndromes, in about
 one hour, by differentiating the novel coronavirus from 21 other 
bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens. QIAGEN’s panel will include 
assays targeting two genes used to detect the pathogen behind the 
disease, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2). The virus was provisionally called 2019-nCoV when it first
 surfaced.</span></p>
<p><span>“The coronavirus emergency goes to the heart of QIAGEN’s 
mission and expertise. Our team is partnering with customers and public 
health authorities worldwide to quickly scale up capacity for 
coronavirus testing, and also to make available the Sample to Insight 
QIAstat-Dx respiratory panel with SARS-CoV-2 detection,” said Thierry 
Bernard, Interim CEO of QIAGEN and Senior Vice President, Head of the 
Molecular Diagnostics Business Area. “We have scaled up production to 
respond to the rapid spread of COVID-19, moving to 24-hour, 
seven-day-a-week operations at two key sites, investing to expand 
capacity by 70% and adding staff. Our top priority is producing the 
QIAamp and EZ1 sample technologies recommended in the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control guidelines for testing, as well as the new QIAstat-Dx 
cartridges. We are working closely with laboratories, hospitals and 
other customers around the world to assess their flexibility, timing and
 quantity needs.”</span></p>
<p><span>QIAGEN is aggressively managing supply chains and customer 
service to help address the pandemic. The company has worked with 
customers to help support laboratory-developed tests, including 
applications for QIAGEN automation systems. Unlike other companies, 
QIAGEN is not facing supply chain interruptions from China or other 
markets. For customers facing delays or allocations, QIAGEN is working 
out individualized supply plans and alternative workflow solutions.</span></p>
<p><span>The HHS funding and QIAGEN’s discussions with the U.S. Food and
 Drug Administration (FDA) are the first steps to adding the QIAstat-Dx 
syndromic testing solution to U.S. efforts to contain the outbreak.</span></p>
<p><span>In the rapidly evolving global response to the coronavirus 
outbreak, the regulatory status of the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2
 Panel will vary by location. The panel will be available with CE-IVD 
marking in Europe and other markets in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p><span>The QIAstat-Dx system was introduced in Europe in 2018 and in 
the United States in mid-2019. It enables fast, cost-effective and 
easy-to-use syndromic testing with Sample to Insight workflows. A 
technician simply loads a clinical sample (such as a swab) into a 
single-use QIAstat-Dx cartridge and places it in the analyzer. QIAGEN 
chemistries for sample processing and analysis are built in, and the 
QIAstat-Dx instrument delivers results in about one hour.</span></p>
