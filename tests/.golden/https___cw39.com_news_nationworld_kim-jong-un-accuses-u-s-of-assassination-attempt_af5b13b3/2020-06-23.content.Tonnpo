<p>PYONGYANG, North Korea - North Korea is accusing the U.S. of trying 
to assassinate the supreme leader! The North Koreans say a "hideous 
terrorist group" conspired with the CIA and and the South Korean 
government to attack Kim Jong Un with a "bio-chemical substance."</p>
<p>You might remember Kim Jong Un's brother was killed earlier this year
 in an airport when police say two women rubbed a toxic substance on his
 face. Many speculate Un was behind the alleged murder of his estranged 
brother, which would mean he's accusing the U.S. of the same thing.</p>
