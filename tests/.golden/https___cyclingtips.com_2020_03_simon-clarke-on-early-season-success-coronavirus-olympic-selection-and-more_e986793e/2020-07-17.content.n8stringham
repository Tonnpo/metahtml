<h1 class="rm-manual">Simon Clarke on early-season success, coronavirus, Olympic selection and more</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">by Matt de Neef</p>
<p class="rm-manual">March 18, 2020</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Photography by Boucles Drome Ardèche / James Startt / Agence Zoom, Kristof Ramon &amp; Cor Vos</p>
<p>Simon Clarke (EF Pro Cycling) started the season in imposing form. He
 took second on a stage at Etoile de Besseges, likewise on a stage of 
the Tour du Haut Var, and then won the Royal Bernard Drome Classic at 
his first attempt. It all augured well for a strong Spring Classics 
season for the Australian, who went eighth at last year’s Strade 
Bianche, ninth at Milan-San Remo and second at the Amstel Gold Race.</p>
<p>And then <a href="https://cyclingtips.com/2020/03/coronavirus-and-the-cycling-world-a-continuously-updated-timeline-of-events/" rel="noopener">coronavirus</a>
 came along and stopped the racing season in its tracks (along with just
 about everything else). Clarke hasn’t raced since winning Drome on 
March 1 and like all pro racers, his season is currently in limbo. 
Chatting to CyclingTips from his home in Andorra — where outdoor riding 
has now reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/EuroHoody/status/1240050903241101315" rel="noopener">been banned</a>
 — Clarke reflects on life as a pro cyclist in the time of coronavirus, 
his excellent start to the year, his chances of being selected for the 
Tokyo Olympic team, and more besides.</p>
<p>CyclingTips: What’s the last few weeks been like?</p>
<p>Simon Clarke: The biggest thing is it’s just been a reality check. I 
mean, to be good at our job we have to be very selfish and self-focused 
and all the rest and here we are worrying about races being cancelled 
and programs being altered when there’s just such a bigger picture in 
the world right now. But when that’s your life, it’s not easy to get 
your head around, you know?</p>
<p>So what do you do? Do you just keep training? Just try to maintain your condition for when racing starts up again?</p>
<p>I’ve kind of gone with the idea that we’re not going to be racing 
until, I reckon, June, at best. So I’ve backed everything off a fair 
bit, knowing that when we do start racing again, we’ll be racing right 
through till the end of the year. And so if you continue to train the 
house down now, by the time we actually do start racing and you want to 
try and race right through, it’s not gonna be really sustainable.</p>
<p>Your team was obviously the first to pull out of races. What was that
 like inside the team? Is that something that you guys as riders pushed 
for or was that a team decision?</p>
<p>It came more from management. I mean, as a rider, it’s pretty hard to
 see the bigger picture, when you’re so focused on personal goals and 
the sacrifices you make, to then sit back and go “Oh, maybe it’s better 
if we don’t ride this.” That never really comes into the equation. That 
[decision to stop racing] particularly came from EF the company, not so 
much the team. Our team is now very much integrated with the whole EF 
business family so a lot of decision-making and whatnot — we’re a part 
of what they decide as a whole company. </p>
<p>We watched as EF China pivoted almost 200,000 students from 
brick/mortar English classes to online in 3 weeks and realized this 
problem needs a creative, leadership driven solution. While this was a 
tough call, we are happy to have an owner in EF that backs bold 
decisions. <a href="https://t.co/xiYVbV7Sd5">https://t.co/xiYVbV7Sd5</a></p>
<p>— Jonathan Vaughters (@Vaughters) <a href="https://twitter.com/Vaughters/status/1234983935555203072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2020</a></p>
<p>Were you supposed to be racing Strade Bianche?</p>
<p>Yeah. I actually nearly cried when I read that email, having won the 
weekend before and Strade Bianche is my favorite race of the year. But 
that feeling quickly passed with the feeling that actually we’re 
probably doing the right thing considering the situation.</p>
<p>It was just hard when it first came out, when it looked like we were 
the only team that was going to not ride, and everyone else was. And I 
was just thinking, “If I’ve got to sit and watch this at home on the TV 
and watch all the other teams races, it’s going to be pretty hard for 
me.” But yeah, that didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Congrats on the win at the <a href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/la-drome-classic/2020" rel="noopener">Royal Bernard Drome Classic</a> a few weeks back. Can you talk about that race and how that unfolded from your perspective?</p>
<p>I’ve actually never done either of those races, Drome [on the Sunday]
 and Ardeche [Faun-Ardèche Classic, on the Saturday]. And they’re 
actually really nice races. I’m not sure why more teams don’t do them 
and I haven’t done them more often because it’s kind of like they’re the
 unofficial opening weekend for the Ardennes kind of riders. You’ve got 
the opening weekend on the cobbles and these two races are pretty much 
quite similar to Ardennes-style races and they’re both really quite 
hard.</p>
<p>The team said to me, “Look, we’re doing these two new races, but 
they’re right up your alley.” And I had pretty good results the week 
before in [Etoile de Besseges] and [Tour du] Haut Var so they really 
told me to come ready to race and ready to try and win.</p>
<p>The first day it was just a blowout. It just pissed with rain from 
start to finish and I froze and I ended up just pulling out thinking 
“I’ll put all my eggs in the basket the next day.” And although the 
finishing photo looked terrible on the Sunday as well, we actually only 
got rained on for the last hour or so. So that actually wasn’t that bad 
on the Sunday even though the finish photo was quite bad considering.</p>
<p>It was a pretty nice day all day and it was just lumpy, but not too 
hard for the first three, 60 km laps or whatever it was. And then we did
 one last different lap to finish and it was just full of climbs. I 
think there was like five climbs and just one after the other, no flat 
in between, just up and down. And that’s basically: one, where it 
started raining, and; two, when the race was decided.</p>
<p>Knowing that I had good legs and I pulled out the day before I was 
pretty motivated to make up for it the next day and just tried to 
position myself well on the wet descents because they were quite 
technical and then pick the right move to get away.</p>

 Drome Classic. (Image: Boucles Drome Ardèche / James Startt / Agence 
Zoom)</p>
<p>How did that winning move come about?</p>
<p>Actually, it went away on the flat, not actually on a climb. It went 
away after the third last climb and we’d just raced the whole previous 
four climbs nearly full gas all in a row. There was only 15 or so of us 
left, and [Vincenzo] Nibali was really pushing the pace and he got away 
after the descent on the third last climb, and I jumped across to him 
and then so did [Warren] Barguil. And that was pretty much it.</p>
<p>After that we just worked quite well together. There were two more 
kickers before the finish. But the most important part was the last 
kicker, which finished at a K to go. We did it every lap except at the 
top we went straight and we didn’t turn left like we did at the finish. 
So the last kilometre we actually never saw during the race. And it was 
super technical. It was like these two really tight switchbacks and then
 about five corners and then the last corner was with 120 metres to go. 
So whoever was first through the last corner was gonna win. No one was 
coming past you.</p>
<p>So luckily the start was actually at the finish area and so after we 
did the teams presentation all of our boys went and rode the last 
kilometre together. So I actually knew exactly what was coming. And 
yeah, that made it a pretty big difference, knowing that — particularly 
in the wet — coming into that finish and needing to be first through the
 last corner and how you were gonna make that happen. Seeing that last 
kilometre was vital in finishing off the race. There’s no use being at 
the front if you don’t know how you’re going to ride the finish.</p>
<p>I went to the front at the K to go, at the top of the last kicker, 
ready for the descent so that at least I was in control of going down 
the tricky switchbacks and then Nibali came past me and I jumped behind 
him. So I had Nibali in front and Barguil behind and I just held Nibali 
there and actually gave him a little bit of space so that it kind of 
discouraged Barguil to jump me. And then I just lined up Nibali coming 
out of the second last corner with about 350 to go, knowing that 
basically the finish line was at 120 to go.</p>

<p>You had a great start to the year, and you had an awesome year last 
year obviously. How much of that do you put down to changing things 
around and skipping the Aussie summer races in 2019 and 2020?</p>
<p>Yeah, so last year I actually <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7emkFZA_-m/" rel="noopener">had a baby in January</a>,
 which is the reason why I skipped all those races. We didn’t change the
 program intentionally to skip the Aussie stuff. I was just semi-forced 
to by the situation and as a result it went well. And so I kind of said 
to the team, “This year is a massive year for me. I’m up for contract 
and we’ve got Olympics in the picture as well”, which the team isn’t 
selected for until the end of April. So I said to the team, “What do you
 think about just replicating my exact program from last year and trying
 to repeat similar performances?” And they were all on board with that.</p>
<p>That’s been the plan all along this year — to hit February like I did
 last year. Last year I just came short of winning Tour of Provence and 
although I didn’t do Provence this year, I purposely changed that with 
Besseges because they changed the course in Provence for this year and 
it was a completely different race. I don’t know if you saw, but they 
finished up Mont Ventoux which they didn’t do last year. So I saw that 
announcement in October and quickly rang the team and said, “Yeah, I 
reckon Tour of Provence is off this year. [laughing]” And so I switched 
that around. And that ended up working out really well.</p>
<p>Besseges was a really nice race this year. I was a little bit 
underdone, but it was obviously 10 days earlier than Provence was last 
year so I was conscious that maybe I didn’t want to hit that period, my 
first race, quite as good as I was last year. And then by Haut Var I was
 feeling really good and I was able to get a second in a stage at Col 
d’Eze there behind Quintana. That led into a nice little win the next 
weekend.</p>
<p>So all was on track until it wasn’t. But I mean, that’s reality. Sure
 it’s a little bit frustrating, but I’m the first one to accept that we 
need to do exactly what we’re doing for the benefit of the community. 
There’s much more important things than racing a pushbike.</p>
<p>Clarke had a very strong 2019 season, headlined by a second place in an unforgettable Amstel Gold Race.</p>
<p>Is your success the past season and a bit simply down to removing 
that early-season peak in Australia, which instead allows you to have 
that first peak later in the year?</p>
<p>I think there’s multiple factors. I think one of the main factors is 
actually just a personal thing. I wouldn’t necessarily say that because 
it’s working for me, everyone should do it like that. I always really 
struggled being really good in January because I just didn’t have as 
much time as I needed to get going properly. And so every year I was 
racing January at 85, 90%, not because I wanted to, just because I 
wasn’t ready in time. I needed more time.</p>
<p>And so I think without changing my whole race program — finishing the
 season earlier than I normally do, and then starting early — I wasn’t 
going to be able to change how well I was going in Australia. So by 
skipping Australia, not only did I have more time, but I’ve done the 
last two years a much more gradual build-up.</p>
<p>So when I start training in November, it’s like eight weeks or 
something to Nationals from day one. And so you’re trying to do some 
base, some midrange stuff, and then intensity in eight weeks, and you 
break it down and you go, “Right, I’ve got like two and a half weeks of 
each block and then I’ve got to be good”, you know? Whereas when you 
don’t race till February, you’ve got a month of each of those, more or 
less. And so just that much more gradual and more thorough build up, I 
think, results in a much higher level of fitness and form than I’ve been
 able to get previously and I think that’s the biggest factor for me.</p>
<p>But once again, I think it’s quite a personal thing. You see guys 
like Luke Durbridge and Darryl Impey and even Gerro [Simon Gerrans] when
 he was still riding, they were really good at being good in January. 
But it was just something that I’ve always struggled with. And then I 
was trying to be good then and then by trying to be good then, but 
actually still not being great, I was sacrificing how good I was later 
on in the spring because I skipped all of the thorough build-up that I’m
 now doing.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean I don’t ever want to race in Australia again. I 
really miss doing it and I really want to go back there. But I need to 
rethink how I do that. At this stage I plan on racing in Australia next 
year, obviously depending on how the season unfolds this year with race 
rescheduling. But if all goes to plan, I hope to be racing in Oz next 
year but I’m gonna try and review how I approach that and do it a little
 bit differently to what I’ve been doing the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Assuming that the season gets back on track at some point in the next
 few months, are you pretty confident of making the Tokyo Olympic squad?</p>
<p>No. I’m hopeful. I believe I’m on the long-list of six but it’s a 
very, very tough team to make because we only qualified four spots and 
then the track tends to normally take an extra spot for their teams 
pursuit so that takes us down only to three spots. And so to make a 
three-man team is a very difficult scenario no matter how many races you
 win and how well you’re going.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it’s gonna be up to the selectors obviously, 
and I’m just trying to perform as well as I can and prove my case as 
best as possible and see what happens. I’m pretty aware that it’s a 
super tough team to make. You’ve got the likes of Jack Haig and Michael 
Matthews and Rohan Dennis all going really well. So it’s not going to be
 easy. </p>
<p>You mentioned it before but this year is a contract year for you. How
 does the chaos around coronavirus and a lack of racing change things in
 that regard?</p>
<p>I mean, it was a bit frustrating missing those races, knowing I was 
in good condition and a nice result would have been super helpful for 
the contract negotiations. But at the same time, it’s the same for all 
of us and you’ve just gotta remind yourself that you’re not the only one
 sitting at home and everyone’s in the same boat and try and just shift 
the focus to later on in the year.</p>
<p>I’m pretty motivated now on just focusing on the Tour de France. I 
think that there’s a pretty good chance that that’ll still go ahead in 
some way, shape or form. So I’m going to focus on that and obviously 
with Olympics being a week after Tour de France, that falls in the same 
category — obviously, depending on whether I’m selected or not — but 
they’ll be my next two focuses for now.</p>
<p>I’ve pretty much given up on the fact that we won’t be racing anymore
 Classics this year, before July anyway. Maybe they’ll reschedule them 
till after, but they won’t be happening in their original form. </p>
<p>That was all the questions I had. Was there anything else you wanted to add?</p>
<p>I think it’s just important that we all remember in this time how 
important health and good lifestyle is on top of everything else that we
 do in our lives. Whether you’re an athlete or you’re getting caught up 
in work and whatnot, I think this period now with this pandemic that 
they’ve announced is a pretty big wake-up call.</p>
<p>We need to remember life’s short and to look after ourselves and make
 the most of it. What you may think seems important in life actually 
probably isn’t quite so much. Family and good health is the most 
important thing.</p>
