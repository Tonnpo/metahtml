<p>The United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom attacked China for
 its slow and secretive response to coronavirus Thursday, saying other 
countries wouldn’t have to be dealing with outbreaks if China had made 
the right decisions.</p>
<p>Ambassador Woody Johnson <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chinas-secrets-and-lies-turned-covid-19into-a-global-threat-cdqf7r02p" rel="noopener noreferrer">made the comments</a>
 in an op-ed in The Times, adding that not only had China allowed the 
virus to spread, but it was now attempting to shift blame to the U.S.</p>
<p>“Had China done the right things at the right time, more of its own 
population, and the rest of the world, might have been spared the most 
serious impact of this disease,” he wrote.</p>

<p>Johnson’s comments echo those of President Donald Trump, who recently
 described China’s early action on the coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan as “<a href="https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/21/trump-china-messages-xi-jinping-coronavirus/" rel="noopener noreferrer">secretive</a>.” <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/25/new-york-coronavirus-white-house/" rel="noopener noreferrer">(RELATED: NY Health Commissioner Tells People Not To Follow White House Coronavirus Guidance)</a></p>
<p>“I have a tremendous relationship with President Xi. I wish they 
could have told us earlier,” Trump said last week. “China was very 
secretive, and that’s unfortunate.”</p>
<p>The administration has also hit China for spreading misinformation 
that U.S. soldiers were responsible for starting the outbreak in Wuhan. 
China has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/conspiracy-theorists-blame-the-us-for-coronavirus-china-is-happy-to-encourage-them/2020/03/05/50875458-5dc8-11ea-ac50-18701e14e06d_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">fostered</a> the conspiracy theories by censoring detractors. <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/23/germany-coronavirus-ban-groups-of-two/" rel="noopener noreferrer">(RELATED: Germany Bans Meetings Of More Than Two People)</a></p>
<p>“It is bad enough when conspiracy-theory cranks spread dangerous 
misinformation around the world. It is far worse, and more dangerous, 
when malign misinformation is spread by a government’s officials, And 
that is exactly what the People’s Republic of China has been doing, 
spreading false accusations about the origin and spread of the 
coronavirus,” Johnson wrote.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://cbs6albany.com/news/coronavirus/stefanik-looking-to-hold-china-accountable-for-spread-of-coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer">have suggested</a>
 the international community should hold China responsible for the virus
 and require some form of compensation, but Trump has not made a public 
statement on the issue.</p>
