<p>South Korean government sources told Reuters on Monday that they have
 not detected any suspicious activity in North Korea after reports 
surfaced that the country’s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, was “in grave 
danger” following a surgery.</p>
<p>According to CNN, the United States is currently monitoring reports that Un is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">facing</a> serious health complications as a reult of a surgery.</p>
<p>A U.S. official informed CNN that the reports concerning the North 
Korean leader’s health are legitimate, but the level of severity could 
not be confirmed.</p>
<p>However, two South Korean government sources <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-politics/south-korea-says-north-korean-leader-kim-not-gravely-ill-idUSKBN223011" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> Reuters that the claims about Un’s health were false.</p>
<p>“We have no information to confirm regarding rumors about Chairman 
Kim Jong Un’s health issue that have been reported by some media 
outlets. Also, no unusual developments have been detected inside North 
Korea,” spokesman for South Korea’s presidential Blue House Kang 
Min-seok said in a statement, <a href="https://apnews.com/f477033c5883c24d3583ad1fe8824e52" rel="noopener noreferrer">according</a> to AP News.</p>
<p>Kim was last seen nine days ago on April 11th and recently missed the
 celebration of his grandfather Kim Il Sung on April 15th, raising 
questions regarding his health, CNN reported. According to Reuters, Kim 
was believed to be recovering from a cardiovascular procedure “at a 
villa in the Mount Kumgang resort county of Hyangsan.” <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2020/04/19/stefan-halper-papadopoulos-fbi-russian-trubnikov-crossfire-hurricane/" rel="noopener noreferrer">(RELATED: FBI Informant Bragged About Links To Russian Spies In Secret Recording Of Trump Aide)</a></p>
<p>“I’m told by a U.S. Official with direct knowledge that the U.S. is 
monitoring intelligence that the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in 
grave danger following a surgery,” said CNN Chief National Security 
Correspondent Jim Sciutto. “Now, we should note that Kim, he recently 
missed the celebration of his grandfather Kim Il-sung’s birthday on 
April 15th. This raised speculation about his well being, about his 
health.”</p>
<p>“It was the absence in recent days that had begun to raise questions 
about his well being, and now the U.S. is monitoring intelligence that 
he had undergone a surgery, that there were problems and that his health
 is now in grave danger.”</p>
<p>Breaking: The US is monitoring intelligence that North Korean leader 
Kim Jong Un’s health is in grave danger following a surgery, a US 
official with direct knowledge tells me.</p>
<p>— Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimsciutto/status/1252411218720985094?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></p>
<p>WATCH:</p>
<p> Kim has no clear heir, and his death could cause a power struggle 
between rival political factions within the DPRK. The North Korean 
leader’s health has been in decline for several months due to heavy 
smoking and obesity, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/21/north-koreas-kim-getting-treatment-after-cardiovascular-procedure.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC reports.</a></p>
<p>Sciutto noted U.S. intelligence did not report to him that Kim’s 
health conditioned is a result of COVID-19. North Korea currently 
reports zero confirmed cases of the coronavirus virus, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>, however these numbers are believed to be misleading.</p>
<p>News coming out of North Korea is notoriously unreliable; for example, North Korean state-run newspaper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rodong Sinmun </a>has consistently reported zero cases of COVID-19 within the communist state despite how widespread the virus has become.</p>
<p>Based on experience, shouldn’t we all doubt this Kim story?</p>
