<p class="rm-manual"> Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Test FAQs </p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Test FAQs</h3>
<p class="rm-manual">Summary</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency 
Use Authorization (EUA) for the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody 
test. The test is designed to help determine if a patient has been 
exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and if the patient has developed 
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Roche has already started shipping the 
new antibody test to leading laboratories globally and will ramp up 
production capacity to the high double-digit millions by mid-May to 
serve healthcare systems in countries accepting the CE mark¹ as well as 
the U.S.</p>
<p>What is an “antibody test” and a “serology test”? What type of sample is required?</p>
<p>An antibody test detects antibodies that an individual produces after
 exposure to a pathogen such as the novel coronavirus. A serology test 
is a diagnostic test involving blood serum—the part of a person’s blood 
that contains proteins other than those involved in blood clotting. 
Roche’s new test is both an antibody test and a serology test in that it
 uses blood serum to determine the presence of antibodies associated 
with exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. From patients, blood samples 
drawn by health-care professionals are required, similar in size to 
samples drawn for common lab tests.</p>
<p>Why are such tests important in dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic?</p>
<p>Antibody tests such as Roche’s can assess if a person was exposed to 
the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The test may be used in epidemiological research 
to better understand the spread of the disease, and together with 
molecular tests, to aid in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients.
 If further studies confirm that antibodies confer immunity to 
SARS-CoV-2, and how long this immunity lasts, then this could help 
determine if individuals can go back into the workforce without risk of 
being infected and infecting others.</p>
<p>Are specific instruments needed to run the Roche antibody test? Are 
they the same instruments used with the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test? If not, 
why not?</p>
<p>Roche’s antibody test is performed on a cobas e analyzer—cobas e 411,
 cobas e 601/602, or cobas e 801. The cobas e analyzers required for the
 antibody test are not the same as the cobas 6800/8800 platforms used 
with Roche’s molecular test for SARS-CoV-2. The technology of serology 
testing is different.</p>
<p>Where are the tests, the cobas e analyzers, and the needed consumables made?</p>
<p>The Roche antibody test is being developed in Penzberg, Germany, and 
produced in Penzberg and Mannheim, Germany. The analyzers on which this 
test will run are produced in Japan. Other components, such as system 
consumables and reagents, originate throughout our global supply chain 
network.</p>
<p>How many tests will you have, and how will you decide where to distribute them?</p>
<p>We anticipate producing high double-digit millions of tests per month globally.</p>
<p>What is the installed base of cobas e analyzers in the U.S.?</p>
<p>More than 3,000 cobas e analyzers of the four models are installed in the U.S.</p>
<p>How many tests will be going into my lab/location/state?</p>
<p>We are committed to deliver the broadest geographic impact to areas 
most impacted by the virus. In alignment with the government, we will 
focus on ensuring laboratories in high population density areas have 
access and scale global production rapidly in an effort to expand 
broader access as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Are you coordinating allocation of these tests with the Federal Government?</p>
<p>We remain in constant dialogue with the White House coronavirus task 
force and government agencies with regard to the allocation of tests and
 other issues related to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Will you keep producing your COVID-19 diagnostic test and support the
 Research Use Only (RUO) solution you announced in February?</p>
<p>Yes, we have been increasing production of the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 
Test, which received EUA on March 12, 2020. We also continue to support 
laboratories carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing on our LightCycler® and 
cobas z 480 Analyzers to run the TIB Molbiol LightMix® assays.</p>
<p>What is the price of the Roche antibody test and how does it compare with similar tests?</p>
<p>In pandemic situations like this, cost should not be a barrier to 
accessing diagnostics. We are committed to delivering as many tests as 
possible to people who need them.</p>
<p>Individual labs determine the price of the tests they offer to patients.</p>
<p>Do you have enough supply of reagents and consumable materials to 
manufacture the antibody test and allow laboratories to use it in large 
numbers?</p>
<p>We are confident in our ability to manufacture the antibody test in 
large and growing numbers in the weeks ahead. When planning the ramp up 
of our test, we have taken a holistic view on all the different 
consumables and general purpose reagents that are needed to run the 
test. We are in close contact with the suppliers of the system 
consumables and ramping up production to ensure the assumed increased 
demand coming from anti-SARS-CoV-2 testing can be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Will Roche’s test be an IgG, IgM or IgG/IgM assay?</p>
<p>The Roche Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay detects high affinity antibodies, 
using the double antigen sandwich (DAGS) format. The Roche assay will 
detect IgM, IgA, or IgG antibodies if they are high affinity antibodies,
 which appear in the late or convalescent phase of infection. This 
approach offers excellent specificity, as evidenced by the 99.81% 
specificity across 5,272 samples, and greatly reduces the risk of false 
positives.</p>
<p>Why is Roche developing an antibody test for SARS-CoV-2?</p>
<p>The primary purpose of our test is to assess exposure status to 
SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated multiple antigens to choose the best assay 
format. Our high affinity antibody assay design targets only mature 
antibodies, and has less probability of detecting weakly cross-reacting 
antibodies than an indirect assay format. Since understanding exposure 
to the virus is most important at this phase of the pandemic, an assay 
design with high specificity and low cross-reactivity is key.</p>
<p>What specimen type is needed for the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay?</p>
<p>This test will run Serum, Li-heparin Plasma, K2 EDTA, and K3 EDTA.</p>
<p>How long does it take to get a result?</p>
<p>The assay will be an 18 minute test.</p>
<p>What is the specificity of the test?</p>
<p>Based on the measurement of a total of 5272 samples, the Elecsys® 
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay has 99.81% specificity and shows no 
cross-reactivity with the common cold coronaviruses. This means it can 
lower the chance of false positives.</p>
<p>What is the clinical sensitivity?</p>
<p>The assay exhibited 100% clinical sensitivity for samples collected &gt;14 days after PCR confirmation. Please visit the <a href="file:///us/en/products/params/elecsys-anti-sars-cov-2.html">product page</a> for more detailed information.</p>
<p>How can customers order the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay?</p>
<p>At this time, access to the test will be limited. We are working to 
ensure access to labs with the broadest geographic reach to the highest 
population densities impacted the most by COVID-19. The situation is 
fluid, as we adapt our strategy in realtime to provide the greatest 
patient impact, we will provide updates on our <a>COVID-19 Updates </a>page.</p>
<p> SARS-CoV-2 FAQs </p>
<h3>SARS-CoV-2 FAQs</h3>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>On March 12, 2020, Roche received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for
 the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test to detect the virus that causes COVID-19, 
which the World Health Organization has classified as a pandemic. 
Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s fully 
automated cobas® 6800 and cobas® 8800 Systems, which are widely 
available in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
<p>How does the test work?</p>
<p>The test detects the genetic signature (RNA) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus 
in swab samples that a healthcare provider collects from the back of the
 patient’s throat or nose.</p>
<p>Where is the test performed?</p>
<p>Healthcare providers can send patient samples to hospital and 
reference laboratories across the U.S. to run the test. As of April 28, 
2020 there are currently 100 hospitals and laboratory sites serving all 
50 states and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Where is the test made?</p>
<p>Roche designed the test in California and produces it in New Jersey. 
The cobas 6800/8800 Systems are manufactured in Switzerland.</p>
<p>How fast is the test?</p>
<p>After the lab starts the test, results are available in about 3.5 
hours. The instruments can process up to 384 results (cobas 6800 System)
 and 1056 results (cobas 8800 System) in an 8-hour shift.</p>
<p>How many tests can you supply?</p>
<p>Roche began shipping tests to U.S. laboratories on March 13. We were 
initially able to supply 400,000 tests per week to the U.S. market and 
continue to improve our production capabilities to increase weekly 
supply for our customers. We are currently shipping approximately 8 
million tests per month worldwide.</p>
<p>What is the price of the test?</p>
<p>In pandemic situations like this, cost should not be a barrier to 
accessing diagnostics. We are committed to delivering as many tests as 
possible to people who need them.</p>
<p>Although our EUA test was the first new commercial test introduced 
during this unprecedented pandemic, its price remains consistent with 
all other standard viral tests for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems 
platform.</p>
<p>Individual labs determine the price of the tests they offer to patients.</p>
<p>Will there be enough tests to meet demand?</p>
<p>We are doing everything possible to produce as many tests as we can. 
Since this is a global health emergency, demand is outpacing supply.</p>
<p>Roche welcomes the subsequent Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of 
more than 25 additional tests developed by our competitors, spanning 
various platforms and features, which together will help to meet demand.</p>
<p>How is Roche deciding what customers get the test?</p>
<p>We are working to ensure the greatest access for patients in the U.S.
 – and the rest of the world - by bringing together the nation’s 
public-health interests with the development and testing capacities of 
the private sector. In close consultation with the government we are 
supporting the national public health strategy by prioritizing access 
to:</p>
<ol> <li>Large commercial laboratories—with the necessary instruments in
 place—that can quickly collect, process and move samples to maximize 
testing capabilities and provide the widest geographic coverage.</li> <li>Hospitals and laboratories in geographic regions that are currently experiencing large-scale community spread of infection.</li> </ol>
<p>The situation is fluid and we are adapting our strategy in real time.
 We monitor daily customer inventory levels and test usage. This 
information helps us update our allocation planning as necessary to 
ensure that we provide testing supplies where and when they are needed 
most</p>
<p>Where can patients get the test?</p>
<p>Roche does not supply tests directly to patients. If you think you 
have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop a fever and symptoms, such as 
cough or difficulty breathing, call your healthcare provider for medical
 advice. The test can only be ordered by a medical professional and is 
intended for patients who meet the clinical and epidemiological criteria
 for COVID-19 testing.</p>
<p> GENERAL FAQS </p>
<h3>GENERAL FAQS</h3>
<p>Do you foresee any disruption to the test supply as a result of closed borders?</p>
<p>Given the importance of these tests, we have been able to work with 
the authorities to ensure continuity of supply and we do not anticipate 
closed borders being an obstacle.</p>
<p>Will travel restrictions impact the ability to service hospitals / instruments running the SARS-CoV-2 test?</p>
<p>Our focus remains to keep customers up and running. We have a task 
force that meets daily to ensure rapid response to emerging crisis 
topics that may impact support. Our current strategies that are intended
 to keep our employees safe, optimize our service and keep our customers
