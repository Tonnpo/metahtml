<p>North Koreans are reported to be <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/north-koreas-secret-coronavirus-crisis-is-crazy-scary?ref=author" rel="noopener noreferrer">dying in large numbers</a>
 from the spreading novel coronavirus, but their leader Kim Jong Un is 
making a show of his god-like invulnerability, photographed with no 
protective face mask while all those around him are wearing theirs. How 
else to see his gleeful smile as he <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-nuclear-threats-from-iran-and-north-korea-working-together-grow-by-the-day?ref=author" rel="noopener noreferrer">watches missiles</a> taking off?</p>
<p>“Kim Jong Un doesn’t need a mask, of course, since he is immortal,” 
says Evans Revere, who studied Korean issues for years as a U.S. 
diplomat.</p>
<p>As for the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/after-the-christmas-gift-guessing-game-watch-for-kim-jong-uns-new-year-surprises?ref=author" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent volleys of five short-range</a>
 missiles, Revere sees them as “signaling to the United States and 
others that, even in the midst of the coronavirus epidemic, North Korea 
is a force to be reckoned with and its military continues to strengthen 
its capabilities.”</p>
<p>The message, says Revere, is basic: “Don’t think we are weak and 
vulnerable” and don’t “assume that the DPRK (Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea) is going to be weak and quiet” while President Donald
 Trump “has all but decided to ignore North Korea and focus on his 
re-election.”</p>
<p>“Daily NK reported that 180 soldiers had died in January and February and another 3,700 soldiers were now under quarantine.”</p>
<p>Officially, there have been no infections and no deaths in North 
Korea. But if, as reports suggest, soldiers are dying in significant 
numbers, that adds urgency to the same message. Kim needs to stand as a 
strong, fearless leader commanding soldiers who are better fed and 
fitter than most North Koreans.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget, all pictures of Kim Jong Un are supervised by the 
Korean Workers’ Party Propaganda and Agitation Department, and their 
primary focus is demonstrating the superiority of the ‘great leader,’” 
says Bob Collins, author of several books on North Korea’s ruling 
structure. “It shows the North Korean population that the great leader 
is so powerful that he does not need a mask. Showing him with a mask 
would seriously detract from his aura of invincibility.”</p>
<p>Collins, who made a career analyzing North Korea for the U.S. Forces Command in Seoul, has no doubt about the credibility of <a href="https://www.dailynk.com/english/sources-almost-200-soldiers-have-died-covid-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a report by the Seoul website Daily NK</a>
 claiming nearly 200 North Korean soldiers have died from the COVID-19 
disease brought on by the coronavirus. Citing a source inside North 
Korea’s military, Daily NK said that 180 soldiers had died in January 
and February and an additional 3,700 soldiers were now under quarantine.
 </p>
<p>That number of deaths from the disease “is a drop in the bucket for 
North Korea’s military establishment of more than one million men,” says
 Collins. “Far more than that starve to death or die from causes brought
 on by malnutrition. What it does indicate is an inability of the 
military to contain the virus within the ranks.” </p>
<p>The soldiers who are known to have died, said Daily NK, were mostly 
stationed along the North Korean border with China, which the North 
closed to traffic after the first reports of coronavirus in January. But
 there is no way North Korean border guards can stop movement across the
 Yalu River and Tumen Rivers that are the boundary. </p>
<p>“It does seem likelier than not that the novel coronavirus is now 
circulating within North Korea,” says David Straub, longtime U.S. 
diplomat in Seoul. “Despite North Korea having closed its borders early 
in the outbreak in China, the two countries share too long a border and 
have too many ties for North Korea to be able to completely seal itself 
off.”</p>
<p>“North Korean officials are telling people in the country to use 
‘salt water’ to disinfect their hands and surfaces in their homes and 
workplaces”</p>
<p>— Daily NK</p>
<p>Daily NK counts on contacts by mobile phones linked to Chinese 
networks near the northern border for what’s going on inside North 
Korea. Editor Robert Lauder acknowledges these sources “are not 
medically trained” and may actually be confusing coronavirus with other 
diseases, but believes the reporting “provides insight and contours into
 what we know already—North Korea has been hit with a COVID-19 
outbreak,” and it goes far beyond the armed forces.</p>
<p>“They’ve been under lockdown to keep information from getting out. 
Their health system is not capable of handling anything,” says Bruce 
Bechtol, a former intelligence analyst at the Pentagon and author of 
books on North Korea’s armed forces.</p>
<p>While conducting regular military exercises, North Korea soldiers 
exist on rations that are no doubt better than most average citizens but
 are far from adequate. “If you don’t eat a lot, it shows,” says 
Bechtol. “There are probably thousands of cases.”</p>
<p>Bruce Bennett, longtime analyst with the Rand Corporation, agrees. 
“With 200 dead, that would imply 10,000 cases,” he says. “And if that is
 true, it would explain why Kim Jong Un is seriously scared.” </p>
<p>Kim’s need to project a powerful image goes deep into the foundation 
of his rule. “This situation presents Kim with serious political 
problems,” Bennett explains. “If Kim were really a god, he would not 
have let this disease spread and death happen to his people.” Hence the 
iconic photos. “By being pictured without a mask, he is claiming to be a
 god—that the disease cannot hurt him.”</p>
<p>The timing of the missile shots coincides with the North’s annual 
winter training exercises, for which Kim needs “to depict an image of 
toughness, both personal and national,” says Bruce Klingner, one-time 
CIA analyst, now Korea expert at the Heritage Foundation. By not wearing
 a mask, he’s showing “despite the regime imposing draconian anti-virus 
measures, it still prioritizes military preparedness.”</p>
<p>At the same time, North Korea’s missile-and-nuclear program 
contributes to the weakness of a society that’s far from capable of 
coping with a disaster on the scale of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“The Kim regime is facing the costs of its strategic mistake of 
diverting so many national resources toward missiles and nuclear weapons
 and away from public health and infrastructure,” says Leif-Eric Easley,
 professor at Ewha University in Seoul. The regime “has prioritized 
social control and displays of military strength over the lives and 
livelihoods of the people,” he says, while Kim provides useless advice 
that costs nothing on how to prevent or get over the disease.</p>
<p>“North Korean officials are telling people in the country to use 
‘salt water’ to disinfect their hands and surfaces in their homes and 
workplaces,” says Daily NK. And that’s just one of a number of “special 
disease-control measures,” mentioned by Kim during a meeting of the 
politburo of the ruling Workers Party.</p>
<p>As for Kim not wearing a mask, “I suspect his reason is the same as 
Donald Trump’s,” says David Straub, the retired diplomat. That’s “to 
show that he is not worried about the virus and that he himself is a 
tough guy.”</p>
