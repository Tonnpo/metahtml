<p class="rm-manual"> <span>Posted on </span><a href="https://drcrime.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/kim-jong-un-is-so-fat-from-eating-cheese-that-he-has-broken-his-ankles/" rel="bookmark">October 1, 2014</a><span> <span> by </span> <span><a href="https://drcrime.wordpress.com/author/annulla/" rel="author">annulla</a></span></span> </p>
<p>Rumours of a coup after the mysterious disappearance of despot Kim 
Jong-un have been put to bed after it was revealed the North Korean 
leader is merely recovering from surgery – after cheese-fuelled weight 
gain caused him to fracture his ankles.</p>
<p>Unbridled daily binges on Emmental imported from Switzerland are 
believed to be responsible for the dictator’s rapid weight gain, with 
some defectors speculating he was trying to match the considerable bulk 
of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung.</p>
<p>And South Korea’s largest newspaper claims that the tubby tyrant is 
in fact recovering from two fractured ankles after the strain of his 
expanding waistline put pressure on a pre-existing injury – and caused 
the bones to crack.</p>
<p>‘I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after 
pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles 
because he left the injury unattended,’ an unnamed source told Chosun 
Ilbo. The source added that the 31-year-old had undergone an operation 
at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party 
members.</p>
<p>Kim, who has not been seen in public in almost a month, missed a 
session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang for the first time
 since ascending to power in 2011, sending the gossip mill into 
overdrive.</p>
<p>Chinese social media Weibo went crazy with reports that a former 
North Korean vice marshal had overthrown Kim in a coup, while outside 
commentators speculated he had developed gout, which runs in his family.</p>
