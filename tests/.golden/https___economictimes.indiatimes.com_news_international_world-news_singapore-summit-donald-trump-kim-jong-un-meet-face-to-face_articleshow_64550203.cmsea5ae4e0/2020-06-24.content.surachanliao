<figcaption>President Trump, Kim Jong Un shake hands in historic Singapore Summit</figcaption><p>After signing a historic pact with <a href="file:///topic/North-Korea">North Korea</a>'s <a href="file:///topic/Kim-Jong-Un">Kim Jong Un</a> on denuclearising the Korean peninsula, US president <a href="file:///topic/Donald-Trump">Donald Trump</a>
 has said sanctions will be lifted when nukes are no longer a factor. He
 has also said he is confident Kim will live up to the agreement. </p>
<p>Here are all the updates on what transpired between the two leaders in the historic <a href="file:///topic/Singapore-Summit">Singapore Summit</a> (All times local): </p>
<p> 5 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump is pushing back on criticism that the U.S. has
 got little in return for his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong 
Un. </p>
<p>Trump tells reporters at a news conference in Singapore after his meeting that he ``gave up nothing.'' </p>
<p>He says ``it's not a big deal'' for world leaders to meet with the president of the United States. </p>
<p>"It's a great thing for China... China was very helpful," Trump says when asked about the role Beijing played. </p>
<p>"I want significant improvement...I want to know it is happening. 
Once we reach that point scientifically and mechanically where it is not
 possible to go back, we can do that," he replies to a question on when 
US will lift sanctions. </p>
<p>Trump announces that he will stop conducting U.S. military ``war 
games'' with ally South Korea while negotiations between the two 
countries continue. </p>
<p>Trump casts the decision as a cost-saving measure, but North Korea has long objected to the drills as a security threat. </p>
<p>Trump also says Kim is committed to denuclearizing his country, but details on how that will happen are yet to thrashed out. </p>
<p>___ </p>
<p> 4:55 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump says he had planned to place another 300 
sanctions on North Korea recently, but he held off because it would be 
``disrespectful'' ahead of the meeting. </p>
<p>He also says that it takes ``a long time to pull off complete 
denuclearization'' but that he will push for North Korea to remove its 
nuclear weapons as fast as it can ``mechanically and physically'' be 
done. </p>
<p>___ </p>
<p> 4:50 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump says the remains of U.S. prisoners of war and 
those missing in action during the Korean War will be returned. </p>
<p>Trump said during a news conference Tuesday after a summit with North
 Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore that he asked Kim to commit to 
returning the remains ``and we got it.'' </p>
<p>The president says he had received ``countless calls'' and letters 
from family members asking him to help them receive the remains of their
 loved ones. </p>
<p>Trump says, ``The remains will be coming back. They're going to start that process immediately.'' </p>
<p> --- 4:50 p.m. </p>
<p>US President Donald Trump addresses media after meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un. </p>
<p>Anyone can make war, most courageous can make peace, says Donald Trump </p>
<p>Trump says Kim Jong Un has accepted his invitation to visit the White House sometime in the future. </p>
<p>Trump says he discussed human rights with Kim Jong Un, will hold more conversations on that in the future. </p>
<p>My talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was honest, direct and productive, says US President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>Kim reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to the complete <a href="file:///topic/denuclearisation">denuclearisation</a> of the Korean peninsula: Trump </p>
<p>US to halt SKorea 'war games' after Kim summit: Donald Trump </p>
<p>We signed a very comprehensive document today and I think when he

<p>President Donald Trump says the remains of U.S. prisoners of war and 
those missing in action during the Korean War will be returned. </p>

 Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore that he asked Kim to commit to 
returning the remains ``and we got it.'' </p>
<p>The president says he had received ``countless calls'' and letters 
from family members asking him to help them receive the remains of their
 loved ones. </p>
<p>Trump says, ``The remains will be coming back. They're going to start that process immediately.'' </p>
<p>Trump says he halted plans last week for 300 new North Korea sanctions designations because it would be `disrespectful' </p>

<p>4:45 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump says he'll invite North Korean leader Kim Jong
 Un to visit the White House at the ``appropriate time.'' And he says 
Kim has accepted. </p>
<p>Trump also says he is open to visiting Kim some day in Pyongyang. </p>
<p>Trump is speaking at a press conference Tuesday after a day of meetings with Kim in Singapore. </p>
<p>It was the first time a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader had met face to face. </p>
<p>Trump praised Kim, calling him ``very talented'' and pointing to his 
rise to power at a relatively young age. He also said the U.S. would be 
ending its joint military exercises with South Korea. </p>
<p>------------- </p>
<p> 4:45 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump says North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is destroying a major missile engine testing site. </p>
<p>Trump says Kim informed him of this development during the historic nuclear summit they held Tuesday in Singapore. </p>
<p>Trump did not give a location for the testing site. </p>
<p>He says the details about the site being destroyed were not included 
in the joint declaration the leaders signed after nearly five hours of 
talks because they agreed to it after the document was signed. </p>
<p>Trump says destruction of the site is a ``big thing.'' </p>
<p>___ </p>
<p> 4:40 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump is defending his repeated praise of North 
Korea's Kim Jong Un during their meetings in spite of Kim's distressing 
record on human rights. </p>
<p>Trump told reporters at a press conference in Singapore on Tuesday 
that Kim ``is very talented.'' He pointed to Kim's rise to power at a 
relatively young age. </p>
<p>Trump has appeared largely unconcerned about the implications of 
feting an authoritarian leader suspected of ordering the public 
assassination of his half brother with a nerve agent, executing his 
uncle by firing squad and killing U.S. college student Otto Warmbier. </p>
<p>But Trump says without Warmbier's death, his meeting with Kim may not have happened. He says, ``Otto did not die in vain.'' </p>
<p>Trump says human rights did come up during the talks, albeit briefly. </p>
<p>Trump says he believes Kim wants to do the right thing. </p>
<p>___ </p>
<p> 4:30 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump says he will be ending joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. </p>
<p>Trump made the announcement Tuesday at a news conference in Singapore
 after his historic meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un. </p>
<p>North Korea has long objected to the annual exercises, viewing them 
as practice for future military action against the North by the United 
States. </p>
<p>Trump cast his decision as a financial consideration, saying the U.S. will save a lot of money by canceling the drills. </p>
<p>___ </p>
<p> 4:25 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump is thanking North Korean leader Kim Jong Un 
``for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his 
people'' after the leaders' historic Singapore summit. </p>
<p>Trump said at a news conference Tuesday after meeting face to face with Kim that ``real change is indeed possible.'' </p>
<p>He also says that he's prepared ``to start a new history'' and ``write a new chapter'' between the two nations. </p>
<p>He says, ``The past does not have to define the future.'' </p>
<p>Trump held a news conference in Singapore before returning home. </p>
<p>___ </p>
<p> 4:20 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump says he gave North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a
 video that laid out the opportunities of their historic meeting. </p>
<p>Reporters were shown the video before the start of Trump's news

images of warplanes and artillery and says there can ``only be two 
results,'' one of moving back or moving forward. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump is finally revealing that he spoke directly 
with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ahead of their Singapore summit. </p>
<p>Trump said in an interview Tuesday with ABC's George Stephanopoulos that he'd spoken with Kim and others before the summit. </p>
<p>?Trump had dodged the question for weeks, refusing to answer reporters who asked about their contact. </p>
<p>During a visit to Mar-a-Lago in April, Trump told a reporter that he 
had spoken with Kim personally, but an aide quickly walked back the 
statement, saying it was other officials who'd spoken with Kim. </p>
<p>It was later revealed that Trump's secretary of state had traveled to Pyongyang to meet with Kim. </p>
<p>Trump is describing his day with Kim as ``very intense.'' He says he 
believes Kim wants to get denuclearization ``done'' and says he trusts 
Kim. </p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has spoken with his Japanese and

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. </p>
<p>Pompeo tweeted shortly after the summit ended Tuesday that he'd 
telephoned South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and Japanese 
Foreign Minister Taro Kono. The State Department released a photograph 
of Pompeo on the phone. </p>
<p>Pompeo says on Twitter he provided the diplomats with ``a brief 
readout of today's meeting'' between Trump and Kim. The two leaders 
concluded their summit by signing a document in which Trump pledged 
``security guarantees'' to the North and Kim reiterated his commitment 
to ``complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.'' </p>
<p>The State Department is declining to release any additional information about the calls. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un have concluded 
an extraordinary nuclear summit by signing a document in which Trump 
pledged ``security guarantees'' to the North and Kim reiterated his 
commitment to ``complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.'' </p>
<p>Light on specifics, the document largely amounted to an agreement to 
continue discussions as it reiterated previous public statements and 
past commitments. It did not include an agreement to take steps toward 
ending the technical state of warfare between the U.S. and North Korea. </p>
<p>The pair promised in the document to ``build a lasting and stable 
peace regime'' on the Korean Peninsula and to repatriate remains of 
prisoners of war and those missing in action during the Korean War. </p>

<p>Moon has met Kim twice in recent months and helped arrange the U.S.-North Korean summit. </p>
<p>Moon said he ``ardently aspires'' for the success of the summit and 
hopes it brings complete denuclearization and peace to the Korean 
Peninsula. </p>

basketball Hall of Famer says it will take multiple visits for the 
countries to have any hope of a peaceful relationship. </p>
<p>Rodman joked that he should be pushing for the Nobel Peace Prize, or 
``at least give me a piece of it.'' He struck up an unlikely friendship

White House staffer called the former ``Celebrity Apprentice'' 
contestant to tell him the president was proud of him. </p>
<p>The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the call. </p>
<p>Rodman struck up an unlikely friendship with Kim over their shared

<p>Trump said Tuesday at the beginning of expanded discussions with 
aides from both countries that ``We will solve a big problem'' and ``a 
big dilemma.'' </p>
<p>He talked about the pair achieving ``tremendous success together'' 
and predicts that ``it will be successful. It will be done.'' </p>

great.'' He says, ``We're going to have a great discussion and a 
terrific relationship.'' </p>
<p>Kim says through an interpreter that it ``was not easy to get here'' 
and that there ``were obstacles but we overcame them to be here.'' </p>
<p>The two men are expected to meet on their own for the better part of an hour, with only a pair of interpreters in the room. </p>

directed Kim to walk down a hallway, where they briefly spoke. </p>
<p>It's the first ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader. </p>

 Dome at Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands resort. </p>
<p>The North's Korean Central News Agency quoted Kim as saying that 
Singapore is ``clean and beautiful and every building is stylish'' and 
that he will learn ``a lot from the good knowledge and experience of 
Singapore in various fields in the future.'' </p>
<p>It's rare that security-obsessed North Korea reports on Kim's 
activities within hours. When Kim visited China for meetings with 
Chinese President Xi Jinping in March and May, state media didn't report
 on the trips until after he returned home. </p>

the U.S., say the haters &amp; losers.'' But he says ``our hostages'' 
are back home and testing, research and launches have stopped. </p>

details of the pre-summit negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang.
 The Blue House didn't elaborate on what Moon was told during the 40 
minute telephone call. </p>
<p>The Blue House says Moon told him South Koreans will be praying for a ``miraculous result.'' </p>
<p>Moon said earlier he hopes the summit will be a ``historic 
milestone'' for peace but it will only be the first step in a complex 
and lengthy process. Moon says the hostility ``cannot be solved at once 
by a single meeting between the leaders.'' </p>
<p>___ </p>
<p> 6:25 p.m. </p>
<p>Iran says North Korea should be wary of negotiating with President 
Donald Trump following his withdrawal from the landmark 2015 nuclear 
agreement. </p>
<p>Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said Monday that North 
Korea should approach this week's summit with Trump with ``awareness.'' 
He says Iran views Trump and the United States with ``great pessimism,''
 saying they are known for ``quitting treaties and violating their 
commitments.'' </p>
<p>Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the 
Obama administration had reached with Iran, Britain, France, Germany, 
China and Russia. The agreement required Iran to curb its uranium 
enrichment in exchange for relief from international sanctions. </p>
<p>Trump has announced the restoration of U.S. sanctions, while European leaders are trying to preserve the deal. </p>
<p>The U.S. president is set to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on Tuesday. </p>
<p>___ </p>
<p> 6:15 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump has accepted an invitation to return to Singapore for a state visit this fall. </p>
<p>That's according to Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. </p>
<p>Trump is expected to travel to Asia in November in conjunction with a pair of regional summits. </p>
<p>The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the president's fall plans. </p>
<p>A White House read-out of Trump's meetings with Prime Minister Lee 
Hsien Loong (lee haz-ee-en lahng) Monday did not include mention of a 
state visit. </p>
<p>Singapore will be hosting Trump's summit Tuesday with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. </p>
<p>___ </p>
<p> 6 p.m. </p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the United States is 
prepared to take actions to provide North Korea with ``sufficient 
certainty'' that denuclearization ``is not something that ends badly for
 them.'' </p>
<p>Pompeo is briefing reporters in Singapore ahead of President Donald 
Trump's summit Tuesday with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He says the
 U.S. is prepared to show North Korea that rather than denuclearization 
posing a threat to North Korea, it's ``the opposite.'' </p>
<p>Pompeo won't say whether Trump would consider withdrawing U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula. </p>
<p>Pompeo says that U.S. sanctions on the North will remain in place 
until the North denuclearizes. But he says if diplomacy fails to move in
 the right direction, the sanctions ``will increase.'' </p>
<p>___ </p>
<p> 5:50 p.m. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump called the leaders of South Korea and Japan 
Monday ahead of his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. </p>
<p>That's according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is briefing 
reporters in Singapore. He says Trump spoke by phone with the two U.S. 
allies as preparatory talks continue between American and North Korean 
officials ahead of the leader sit-down Tuesday morning. </p>
<p>Pompeo says there is ``enormous potential'' for the summit, but 
lowered expectations that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula 
will happen after one meeting. He says: ``We are hopeful the summit will
 have set the conditions for future productive talks.'' </p>
<p>Pompeo also says Tuesday's meeting presents a test of Kim's 
willingness to agree to deal his nuclear weapons away for 
``protections'' from the United States. </p>
