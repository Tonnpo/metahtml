<p>HANOI,— North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald 
Trump met in Vietnam on Wednesday for a second summit that the United 
States hopes will persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons in
 exchange for promises of peace and development.</p>
<p>Trump tweeted after a dinner with Kim at Hanoi’s French-colonial-era 
Metropole hotel that they had had “Great meetings” and a “Very good 
dialogue,” while the White House said the two planned to sign a “joint 
agreement” after further talks on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kim and Trump shook hands and smiled briefly in front of a row of 
their national flags at the Metropole before heading to dinner together.</p>
<p>Trump told reporters he thought the talks would be very successful, 
and when asked if he was “walking back” on denuclearization demands, 
said “no”.</p>
<p>At their historic <span><a href="https://ekurd.net/trump-meets-kim-jong-un-2018-06-12">first summit</a></span>
 in Singapore last June, Trump and Kim pledged to work toward 
denuclearization and permanent peace on the Korean peninsula but little 
progress has been made.</p>
<p>Kim said they had overcome obstacles to hold the second summit and 
praised Trump for his “courageous decision” to begin a dialogue.</p>
<p>“Now that we’re meeting here again like this, I’m confident that 
there will be an excellent outcome that everyone welcomes, and I’ll do 
my best to make it happen,” Kim said.</p>
<p>Trump and Kim held a 20-minute, one-on-one chat before sitting down 
to dinner with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Trump’s acting Chief 
of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Kim’s top envoy, Kim Yong Chol, and North Korean
 Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the two leaders will hold a series of meetings at the 
Metropole, beginning with another one-on-one session lasting 45 minutes,
 the White House said.</p>

<p>It said they would hold a “joint agreement signing ceremony,” at the 
end of their meetings, followed by a news conference by Trump at 3:50 
p.m. Hanoi time (0850 GMT).</p>
<p>The White House has given no indication as to what the signing 
ceremony might involve, although the two sides have held discussions 
that have included the possibility of a political statement to declare 
the 1950-53 Korean War over. North and South Korea have been technically
 at war since the conflict, with the Americans backing the South, ended 
in a truce, not a treaty.</p>
<p>Asked if he would declare a formal end to the Korean War, which North
 Korea has long called for, but some analysts say would be premature, 
Trump said: “We’ll see.”</p>
<p>“We’re going to have a very busy day tomorrow,” a smiling, 
relaxed-looking Trump, said before dinner, seated beside Kim at a round 
table with the other four officials and two interpreters.</p>
<p>“Our relationship is a very special relationship.”</p>
<p>Experts said the pair were at pains to show their relationship had 
improved since their first meeting, with their body language closely 
mirroring each other.</p>
<p>GOOD RELATIONS</p>
<p>Trump said late last year he and Kim “fell in love”, but whether the 
bonhomie can move them beyond summit pageantry to substantive progress 
on eliminating Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal that threatens the United 
States is the question that will dominate the talks.</p>
<p>Trump and Kim’s Singapore summit, the first meeting between a sitting
 U.S. president and a North Korean leader, ended with great fanfare but 
little substance over how to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons and
 ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>In the run-up to this summit, Trump has indicated a more flexible 
stance, saying he was in no rush to secure North Korea’s 
denuclearization. He repeated that on Wednesday, saying while some 
people believed the talks should be moving more quickly, he was 
satisfied.</p>
<p>He has also said he would be happy as long as North Korea, which has 
not tested a nuclear weapon or intercontinental ballistic missile since 
2017, maintained that freeze.</p>
<p>Some critics have said Trump appeared to be wavering on a 
long-standing U.S. demand for complete and irreversible denuclearization
 by North Korea, and risked squandering leverage if he gave away too 
much, too quickly.</p>
<p>Evans Revere, a former U.S. negotiator with North Korea, said Trump 
was under pressure, given the criticism and other domestic problems, and
 Kim might try to use that.</p>
<p>“Kim may be tempted to push Trump even harder for concessions, 
knowing how much the president wants and needs that testing pause,” 
Revere said.</p>
<p>‘AWESOME’ POTENTIAL</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials have said there is no sign North Korea 
will ever give up its entire arsenal of nuclear weapons, which it sees 
as its guarantee of national security. Pyongyang will not commit to 
significant disarmament unless punishing U.S.-led economic sanctions are
 eased, analysts said.</p>
<p>The two sides have discussed specific and verifiable denuclearization
 measures, such as allowing inspectors to observe the dismantlement of 
North Korea’s Yongbyon nuclear reactor, U.S. and South Korean officials 
say.</p>
<p>U.S. concessions could include opening liaison offices or clearing the way for inter-Korean projects.</p>
<p>Despite little progress on his goal of ridding North Korea of its 
weapons programs, Trump appeared to be betting on his personal 
relationship with Kim, and the economic incentive after 70 years of 
hostility between their countries.</p>
<p>“Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be 
the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize,” Trump said on 
Twitter ahead of the meeting.</p>
<p>“The potential is AWESOME, a great opportunity, like almost none 
other in history, for my friend Kim Jong Un. We will know fairly soon – 
Very Interesting!”</p>
<p>For Trump, a deal that eases the North Korean threat could hand him a
 big foreign-policy achievement in the midst of domestic troubles.</p>
<p>While he was in Hanoi, Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen 
delivered scathing testimony to a U.S. congressional panel, including 
that “Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, 
not to make our country great.”</p>
<p>Cohen referred to a comment Trump made to him about avoiding the U.S.
 military draft for the Vietnam War on medical grounds: “‘You think I’m 
stupid, I wasn’t going to Vietnam’,” Cohen cited Trump as saying.</p>
<p>“I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam" rel="noopener">Vietnam</a></span> right now,” Cohen said.</p>
<p>Trump said on Twitter that Cohen was lying to reduce his prison time.
 Cohen pleaded guilty to financial crimes and lying to Congress last 
year and a judge sentenced him to three years prison, a term he is due 
to start on March 6.</p>
