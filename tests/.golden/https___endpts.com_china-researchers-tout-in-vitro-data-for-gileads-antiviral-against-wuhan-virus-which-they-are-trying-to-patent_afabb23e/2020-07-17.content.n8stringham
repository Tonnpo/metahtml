<h2 class="rm-manual">Chi­na re­searchers tout in vit­ro da­ta for Gilead­'s an­tivi­ral against Wuhan virus — which they are try­ing to patent</h2>
<h3 class="rm-manual">Amber Tong</h3>
<h4 class="rm-manual">Editor</h4>
<p>There’s no de­fin­i­tive proof yet that <a href="https://endpts.com/gsk-pitches-in-on-the-global-rd-campaign-to-develop-a-vaccine-to-counter-a-likely-coronavirus-pandemic/">Gilead’s remde­sivir</a>
 works as a treat­ment for 2019-nCov, but re­searchers in Chi­na 
clear­ly con­sid­er it promis­ing enough to have ap­plied for a patent 
on its use to com­bat the coro­n­avirus virus out­break stem­ming from 
Wuhan.</p>
<p>Amid world­wide vig­i­lance over what many fear is be­com­ing a 
pan­dem­ic, sci­en­tists from the Wuhan In­sti­tute of Vi­rol­o­gy and 
Na­tion­al En­gi­neer­ing Re­search Cen­ter for the Emer­gency Drug said
 they have test­ed a to­tal of sev­en drugs in vit­ro — and found 
remde­sivir and the malar­ia treat­ment chloro­quine most ef­fec­tive 
against the nov­el coro­n­avirus.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.whiov.cas.cn/kyjz_105338/202002/t20200204_5497136.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">state­ment</a>,
 the in­sti­tu­tions al­so dis­closed that they filed a patent 
ap­pli­ca­tion on Jan­u­ary 21, days be­fore Gilead first an­nounced 
it’s <a href="https://endpts.com/gilead-dusts-off-a-failed-ebola-drug-as-coronavirus-spreads-exelixis-boasts-positive-ph-i-ii-data/">dust­ing off</a> the nu­cle­o­side ana­log — which failed to make the cut as an Ebo­la drug — to test against the new virus.</p>
<p>While ex­perts have in­di­cat­ed that a patent is un­like­ly to be 
grant­ed, the move high­lights grow­ing con­fi­dence in remde­sivir in 
the midst of a glob­al race to hunt an­ti­bod­ies and ther­a­pies for 
2019-nCoV, for which there is no ap­proved treat­ment. The high­ly 
con­ta­gious virus has killed more than 490, most­ly in Chi­na.</p>
<p>The up­date al­so comes as the FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-significant-step-coronavirus-response-efforts-issues-emergency-use-authorization-first" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">is­sued</a>
 its first Emer­gency Use Au­tho­riza­tion (EUA) since the De­part­ment 
of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices de­clared a pub­lic health emer­gency in 
the US on Jan­u­ary 31. The EUA means that the 2019-nCoV di­ag­nos­tic 
pan­el that’s been in use at CDC labs can now be used at any 
CDC-qual­i­fied lab across the coun­try.</p>
<p>Gilead — which has been in a patent <a href="https://endpts.com/gilead-claims-truvada-patents-in-hhs-complaint-are-invalid/">dis­pute</a>
 with the US gov­ern­ment over its HIV fran­chise — didn’t an­swer 
di­rect­ly whether it knew about the patent fil­ing be­fore the 
an­nounce­ment or what it thought about the Chi­nese re­searchers’ 
grounds.</p>
<p>Gilead in­vent­ed remde­sivir and has patent­ed it in Chi­na, 
in­clud­ing fil­ing patent ap­pli­ca­tions for use on coro­n­avirus­es. 
We are aware of re­ports of the Wuhan In­sti­tute for Vi­rol­o­gy’s 
patent ap­pli­ca­tion. Our fo­cus at this time, is on rapid­ly 
de­ter­min­ing the po­ten­tial for remde­sivir as a treat­ment for 
2019-nCoV and ac­cel­er­at­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing in an­tic­i­pa­tion of 
po­ten­tial fu­ture sup­ply needs.</p>
<p>Af­ter US doc­tors <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">re­port­ed</a>
 us­ing remde­sivir as part of the reg­i­men for the first do­mes­tic 
case of 2019-nCoV, Gilead said it’s work­ing with Chi­nese 
au­thor­i­ties to start a ran­dom­ized con­trolled tri­al.</p>
<p>Nine tri­als are al­ready un­der­way to eval­u­ate dif­fer­ent 
com­bi­na­tions of al­ready ap­proved an­tivi­rals and 
cor­ti­cos­teroids, Bio­Cen­tu­ry <a href="https://www.biocentury.com/article/304368" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">not­ed</a>, in­clud­ing HIV drugs such as <a href="https://endpts.com/abbvie-donates-1m-of-the-hiv-drug-that-china-is-now-using-to-contain-coronavirus-outbreak/">Ab­b­Vie’s</a> Kale­tra/Alu­via and Gilead’s De­scovy.</p>
<p>Remde­sivir, on the oth­er hand, is an ex­per­i­men­tal com­pound 
that’s been test­ed in hu­man tri­als. In a Q4 earn­ings call, Gilead 
CEO Daniel O’Day in­di­cat­ed that it may be de­ployed as an emer­gency 
treat­ment. In re­sponse to a ques­tion about man­u­fac­tur­ing 
prepa­ra­tions in the event that they need to scale up pro­duc­tion 
quick­ly, he had this to re­port:</p>
<p>In terms of man­u­fac­tur­ing, our team has re­al­ly been work­ing 
night and day, it’s been very im­pres­sive to watch this team over the 
past cou­ple of weeks re­al­ly ramp up to the ex­tent that we can. Our 
ca­pac­i­ty is go­ing up every day. We’re look­ing at all the op­tions 
we have ex­pect­ing to be pre­pared for what may come.</p>
<p>Ob­vi­ous­ly we are wait­ing for da­ta, both in vit­ro and then in 
peo­ple to en­sure that the drug ac­tu­al­ly works. And it’s im­por­tant
 just for every­one to keep that in mind that this is still 
in­ves­ti­ga­tion­al and we are still wait­ing for more da­ta to know. 
But at risk, we are in­vest­ing pret­ty heav­i­ly to make sure that 
we’re pre­pared as best as we can.</p>
<p>Around the same time, some in vit­ro da­ta were be­ing <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pub­lished</a> on Na­ture as a let­ter to the ed­i­tor.</p>
<p>“No­tably, two com­pounds remde­sivir (EC50 = 0.77 μM; CC50 &gt; 100 
μM; SI &gt; 129.87) and chloro­quine (EC50 = 1.13 μM; CC50 &gt; 100 μM, 
SI &gt; 88.50) po­tent­ly blocked virus in­fec­tion at low-mi­cro­mo­lar
 con­cen­tra­tion and showed high SI,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Giv­en its po­ten­tial, the Wuhan In­sti­tute of Vi­rol­o­gy said in a
 state­ment, it’s ap­plied for a patent in Chi­na and plans to 
dis­trib­ute to oth­er coun­tries via the Patent Co­op­er­a­tion Treaty.
 But should “the rel­e­vant over­seas com­pa­ny” be will­ing to 
con­tribute to the out­break con­trol, they would tem­porar­i­ly 
sus­pend ex­er­cise of their patent rights.</p>
<p>But ex­perts in­ter­viewed by <a href="https://m.21jingji.com/article/20200205/herald/5aff07af6c82edc3d81453b77f6fcae2.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">lo­cal me­dia</a>
 point out that the ap­pli­ca­tion may not go through. Not on­ly does 
Gilead hold the foun­da­tion­al patent to the drug, but it al­so 
ap­plied for one to cov­er remde­sivir’s use in coro­n­avirus­es back in
 2016 — which didn’t spec­i­fy but could ar­guably in­clude this new 
strain.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">CRISPR, the gene-editing system that’s unleashed a

viruses may sound like a strange place for CRISPR to show up. But the

<h3 class="rm-manual">Amber Tong</h3>
<h4 class="rm-manual">Editor</h4>
<p class="rm-manual">One of the many inequalities the pandemic has laid 
bare is the gender imbalance in biomedical research. A paper examining 
Covid-19 research authorship wondered out loud: Where are the women?</p>
<p class="rm-manual">It’s a question that echoes beyond our current 
times. In the biopharma world, not only are women under-represented in 
R&amp;D roles (particularly at higher levels), their achievements and 
talents could also be undermined by stereotypes and norms of leadership 
styles. The problem is even more dire for women of color.</p>

<h2 class="rm-manual">Di­ag­nos­tic champ Roche buys its way in­to the RET ti­tle fight with Eli Lil­ly, pay­ing $775M in cash to Blue­print</h2>

<h4 class="rm-manual">Editor</h4>
<p class="rm-manual">When Roche spelled out its original $1 billion deal
 — $45 million of that upfront — with Blueprint to discover targeted 
therapies against immunokinases, the biotech partner’s RET program was 
still preclinical. Four years later, pralsetinib is on the cusp of 
potential approval and the Swiss pharma giant is putting in much more to
 get in on the commercial game.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Roche gains rights to co-develop and 
co-commercialize the drug, with sole marketing responsibility for places
 outside the US and China (where CStone has staked its claim).</p>

<h4 class="rm-manual">Associate Editor</h4>
<p class="rm-manual">Several months after Biogen touted the first 
proof-of-concept data from its $800 million eye gene therapy, MeiraGTx 
and J&amp;J are out with their own early data for a rival treatment.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In a small Phase I/II trial for their gene therapy 
for the degenerative eye disease x-linked retinitis pigmentosa, MeiraGTx
 found that the 7 patients in the two lowest dose cohorts saw their 
vision improve on multiple measures for 6 months. The study will provide
 the basis for the New York biotech to move into a pivotal Phase III for
 the gene therapy that J&amp;J paid $100 million <a href="https://endpts.com/jj-snags-rights-to-a-gene-therapy-portfolio-from-little-meiragtx-a-spinoff-from-sam-waksals-kadmon/">to get in on</a> last year.</p>
