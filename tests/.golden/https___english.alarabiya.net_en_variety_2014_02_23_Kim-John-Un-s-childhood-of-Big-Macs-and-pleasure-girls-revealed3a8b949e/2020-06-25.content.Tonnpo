<p class="rm-manual"> <span>By Staff Writer </span> <span>Al Arabiya News</span> <span>Sunday 23 February 2014</span> </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Text size <a href="">A</a> <a href="">A</a> <a href="">A</a> </p>
<p>Driving cars at seven, binge drinking vodka at 14 and being around 
his father’s pleasure girls throughout his teens, it is little wonder 
Kim Jong-un’s excessive and twisted upbringing would yield the leader 
North Korea has today.</p>
<p>Former companion Kenji Fujimoto, who spent more than a decade as the 
ruling family’s personal chef and Kim's playmate, is now coming forward 
to give the most detailed account of the leader’s troubling childhood to
 ever be released.</p>
<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (R), flanked by his uncle North 
Korean politician Jang Song-thaek, leaves a military parade to mark the 
birth anniversary of the North's late leader Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang, 
in this photo taken by Kyodo February 16, 2012.</p>
<p>“In the palace, I had two jobs really. For Kim Jong-Il (the current 
leader's father), I was his main sushi chef. For Kim Jong-un, I was 
there to play with him, almost like a nanny,” says Fujimoto to<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2565558/My-playmate-monster-A-tyrant-nursery-Vodka-binges-14-Big-Macs-brigade-pleasure-girls-The-man-saw-Kim-Jong-Un-rock-star-boyhood-blood-soaked-dictatorship-tell-story.html"> The Daily Mail</a> on Saturday.</p>
<p>"I would say I was the closest person to him when he was young. I felt like he was my own son.”</p>
<p>From the age of six, Jong-un spent hours of every day with the chef.</p>
<p>Allowed egregious privileges at a young age, Fujimoto recalls Jong-un
 demanding to drive a car, a Mercedes no less, at the age of seven.</p>
<p>“They put a little box beneath his feet to help him reach the pedals 
and someone gave him instruction. The first car he got was a 
Mercedes-Benz, and he has owned Mercedes ever since. I’d say he has more
 than ten now – all bulletproof.”</p>
<p>Around the age of 14, he began to take up smoking.</p>
<p> McDonald's in New York's Times Square. While the U.S. fast food 
giant has no prescence in the communist country, Kim Jong-un found a way
 to get his hands on contraband Big Mac burgers from the chain.

<p>He would often show up at Fujimoto’s door at 3 a.m., begging for cigarettes.</p>
<p>Even more troubling, Fujimoto recalls Jong-un drinking at 14.</p>
<p>“[He] drank a lot, too, even as a young teenager – Russia’s finest vodka. Sometimes he’d drink the whole bottle all by himself.”</p>
<p>As time went on, the would-be despot adopted a playboy lifestyle, 
spending time on one of the two yachts his father bought for him. Early 
habits that explain recent reports that claimed the North Korean leader 
spent $716 million dollars in 2012 alone.</p>
<p>In his late teens, Jong-un found himself exposed to his sex-crazed 
father’s ‘pleasure brigade’ – bands of beautiful teenage girls forced to
 sing, strip naked and perform massages and sexual favors.</p>
<p>Fujimoto claims that the 18-year-old was shy with girls and hated 
“having relationships with multiple women.” Jong-un’s reluctance led his
 father to question if his son was interested in girls.</p>
<p>Fujimoto speculates that this hatred of his father’s womanizing is 
what led Jong Un to execute his uncle. Jang Song Thaek, who was 
responsible for picking the girls, used to make girls strip and lift 
their legs to “inspect their virginity.”</p>
<p>The live-in-chef also described an exorbitant lifestyle the family 
enjoyed while millions of North Koreans were dying during the country’s 
two decade famine.</p>

L) look on during a visit to a military base. (File photo Reuters)</p>
<p>“It was incredible, with an enormous chandelier and all-cream furnishings,” Fujimoto says.</p>
<p>“It had an Olympic-size pool, movie theatre and huge gym. The kids’ 
playroom was big, with remote-controlled cars everywhere and a billiard 
table.”</p>
<p>In 2001, Fujimoto fled North Korea to Japan. His escape was viewed as
 betrayal by the leader, who sent assassins to kill the former nanny and
 chef. However, a year later a North Korean official showed up at 
Fujimoto’s doorstep, saying that he had been forgiven and Kim requested 
him to return.</p>
<p>Reluctantly agreeing, he arrived at the leader’s palace.</p>
<p>“I was terrified. I had betrayed Kim Jong-Un by leaving North Korea, so he could have had me killed.”</p>
<p> Uncharacteristic of his notorious temperamental personality, Kim 
smiled at his childhood companion, hugged him, and said, “Long time no 
see, Fujimoto-san. Your betrayal of North Korea has been all forgiven.”</p>
