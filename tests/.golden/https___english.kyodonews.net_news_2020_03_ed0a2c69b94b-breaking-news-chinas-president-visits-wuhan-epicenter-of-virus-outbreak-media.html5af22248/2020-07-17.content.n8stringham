<p>BEIJING - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday visited Wuhan, the 
epicenter of China's new-coronavirus outbreak, state media reported, 
likely showcasing his hands-on approach to efforts to contain the deadly
 epidemic.</p>
<p>Xi's first visit to the central Chinese city since the outbreak comes
 as the country marked the fourth day in a row the number of newly 
reported infections was under 100, with 19 additional cases in mainland 
China.</p>
<p>The president visited residents quarantined at their homes in Wuhan 
after making a stop at a hospital to inspect epidemic prevention and 
control work, a Xinhua News Agency report said, adding that he expressed
 gratitude to those working on the epidemic on the front line.</p>
<p>【習近平抵武漢考察新冠肺炎疫情防控工作】10日上午，習近平乘飛機抵達湖北省武漢市，考察湖北和武漢新冠肺炎疫情防控工作，看望慰問奮戰在一線的廣大醫務工作者、解放軍指戰員、社區工作者、公安干警、基層幹部、下沉幹部、志願者和患者群眾、社區居民。 <a href="https://t.co/99ym7idsnc">pic.twitter.com/99ym7idsnc</a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PDChinese/status/1237218930898264064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2020</a></p>
<p>Cases of new-coronavirus infection emerged in Wuhan late last year. 
Since then, nearly 50,000 people have been found infected in the city of
 11 million, with over 2,400 deaths, according to an official media 
tally.</p>
<p>But the tally also shows nearly 32,000 of the COVID-19 patients have 
been discharged from hospitals. The National Health Commission reported 
17 new cases in Wuhan on Tuesday.</p>
<p>As the number of new infections in the worst-hit city continued to 
drop, state-run media reported that the remaining two of the 16 
temporary hospitals built in Wuhan to accommodate the patients will be 
closed Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Xi visit also comes as the lockdown on Wuhan since late January 
to stamp out the outbreak appears to have taken a toll on residents' 
everyday lives and work.</p>
<p>In one episode last week, a top Chinese official who visited Wuhan 
was reportedly heckled by dissatisfied residents as she inspected the 
prevention and control efforts of a neighborhood committee.</p>
<p>Protesting neighbors accused property management of cheating them by 
only appearing to provide promised necessities, state-run media 
reported.</p>
<p>During his visit to Wuhan on Tuesday, Xi learned about 
community-based efforts at "ensuring people's daily necessities supply,"
 the Xinhua report said.</p>
<p>The number of overall cases in the country has reached 80,754.</p>
<p>Over a 24-hour period to the end of Monday, there were 17 new deaths 
from the virus, all in Hubei Province, of which Wuhan serves as its 
capital, raising the nationwide toll to 3,136, according to the 
commission.</p>
<p>Of the 19 newly confirmed cases, two had been imported from abroad, 
the commission said, marking the third straight day of no new locally 
transmitted cases outside of Hubei.</p>
<p>Maintaining the central government's heightened vigilance toward 
imported infections, Premier Li Keqiang called Monday for stricter 
prevention and control measures against imported cases.</p>
<p>The premier's calls at a high-level government meeting included 
better screening at ports and a suspension or reduction in sending and 
accepting study abroad students.</p>
<p>In a related move, China on Tuesday temporarily suspended a 15-day 
visa waiver program for Japanese tourists. Japanese citizens who visit 
China for business or to meet with their kin continue to be exempt from 
visa requirements.</p>
<p>Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong authorities have already started 
enforcing a 14-day quarantine and observation since last week for those 
traveling from severely infected countries, including Japan, South 
Korea, Iran and Italy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, organizers of the Boao Forum for Asia, a key regional 
economic forum often billed as Asia's alternative to the World Economic 
Forum in Davos, said Tuesday that the event has been postponed 
indefinitely.</p>
<p>The forum, initially scheduled for later this month, joins a rising 
number of global events postponed due to the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The conference has been held annually since 2002. Government 
officials and business leaders from home and abroad were to gather for 
four days from March 24 in the southern island province of Hainan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, authorities in southeastern China's Fujian Province have 
confirmed 20 deaths in the collapse of a hotel used as a coronavirus 
quarantine facility in the coastal city of Quanzhou, local media 
reported.</p>
<p>Of the 71 people who were trapped in the rubble of Xinja Express 
Hotel, 41 have been rescued and the remaining 10 remain trapped.</p>
<p>The 80-room hotel, which was being used for the medical observation 
of people who had contact with coronavirus patients, suddenly collapsed 
on Saturday evening.</p>
