<h2><span>Interesting Kim Jong-Un facts: 1-5</span></h2>
<p>1. Kim Jong-Un is the 3rd generation of the dictator of North Korea 
or the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Democracy and dictatorship
 don’t go hand in hand but that’s how it has been in North Korea for 3 
generations.</p>
<p>2. Kim Jong-Un became the Supreme Leader of North Korea after his dad
 Kim Jong-Il (Dear Leader) passed away unexpectedly in 2011. His father 
Kim Jong-Il and his grandfather Kim Il-Sung (Eternal President) were 
both dictators.</p>
<p>3. The Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un is the only top-ranked military 
official in this whole world who has absolutely no previous military 
experience or even training. </p>
<p>He still controls the world’s 4th largest armed forces, which is 
known to have 1.1 million active military personnel. He became Daejang 
in the army in the year 2010. Daejang in the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea is the same as General in the United States.</p>
<p>4. The only thing that is ‘military’ about the Supreme Leader is that
 he goes nuts over nuclear weapons. He absolutely loves them. Despite 
his lack of military experience, Kim Jong-Un managed to become the head 
of the state using his intelligence and talent.</p>
<p>5. He always wanted to look like Eternal President, i.e. his 
grandfather, and hence, in an attempt to do so, he underwent plastic 
surgery, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1317958/Has-Kim-Jong-Un-plastic-surgery-look-like-grandfather-Kim-Il-Sung.html">Daily Mail</a>.</p>
<h2><span>Interesting Kim Jong-Un Facts: 6-10</span></h2>
<p>6. The Supreme Leader ensured that the entire nation mourned the 
death of his father whole-heartedly. How do you expect people to do so? 
Put them under the threat of being killed by mortar! </p>
<p>That’s precisely what he did to Kim Chol – deputy defense minister of
 North Korea. Kim Chol’s crime was that he got drunk during the mourning
 period and did not sufficiently grieve. He was shot by mortars.</p>
<p>7. China declared Kim Jong-Un as the sexiest man alive in 2012. You 
don’t believe it? Well, the Chinese media actually picked up an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.theonion.com/article/kim-jong-un-named-the-onions-sexiest-man-alive-for-30379">article by newspaper named The Onion</a> where the Supreme Leader was named as the sexiest man alive!</p>
<p>8. Of all world leaders, Kim Jong-Un is the youngest. However, no one
 knows what his actual age is. Some say it is 31, some say 32 and some 
say 33. Well, you can decide which year you will pick as his birth years
 – 1982, 1983, or 1984.</p>
<p>9. In 2012 he was not only named as the sexist man alive on this 
planet, but he has also enjoyed something else! A hillside was carved 
with a 1,800-foot carving which read, “Long Live General, The Shining 
Sun”!</p>
<p>10. Kim Jong-Un suddenly became empathetic and decided to allow women
 to wear platform shoes, pants, and earrings. Not just that, he even 
lifted the ban on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://factslegend.org/20-facts-pizza/">pizza</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://factslegend.org/21-weird-and-interesting-french-fries-facts/">French fries</a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://factslegend.org/20-facts-burgers/">hamburgers</a>. The idea for such radical changes was to create Children’s Heaven Nation and Feminists’ Paradise. Doesn’t that sound creepy?</p>
<h2><span>Interesting Kim Jong-Un Facts: 11-15</span></h2>
<p>11. He had his uncle Jang Song Thaek killed by a firing squad. Jang 
Song Thaek was the second most powerful man in North Korea during the 
rule of Dear Leader. In 2012 a military tribunal found Thaek guilty of 
crimes like dreaming alternative dreams, illegal dining, and adultery. 
His uncle accepted all the crimes and was then executed.</p>
<p>12. The Supreme Leader himself curated the all-female pop group named
 Moranbong Band. The singers always wear short skirts and mostly their 
attire is some kind of military-inspired outfit. The band sings songs 
like ‘We Think of the Marshal Day and Night’ and ‘O My Motherland Full 
of Hope’.</p>
<p>13. The Supreme Leader attended Liebefeld-Steinholz – a school in 
Switzerland using the alias Pak Un. He was admitted to the school as the
 son of an employee of the North Korean embassy in Switzerland.</p>
<p>14. There in Liebefeld-Steinholz he turned out to be excellent in 
music but was terrible with science and math – in both of which he 
failed.</p>
<p>15. While in Switzerland however, Kim Jong-Un fell in love with 
Emmental. Can you guess what it is? Well, it is a type of Swiss Cheese. 
Every year the North Korean government spends literally thousands and 
thousands of pounds just for importing Emmental so that the Supreme 
Leader can fulfill his cravings. Sadly, most of the North Korean 
population is suffering from malnutrition.</p>
<h2><span>Interesting Kim Jong-Un Facts: 16-20</span></h2>
<p>16. The hairstyle of the North Korean supremo is super popular. The 
hairstyle goes by the name ‘ambition’ or ‘youth’ and many young men in 
the country actually opt for the hairstyle. However, his hairstyle is 
his own creation because he is afraid of barbers and cuts his own hair.</p>
<p>17. Apart from his amazing love for Emmental and everything that is 
North Korean, Kim Jong-Un is also undulating love for Nike Trainer – an 
American brand. This totally goes against the anti-American philosophy 
of his father and his grandfather. It is actually reported that when he 
attended the Liebefeld-Steinholz school in Switzerland, he had a massive
 collection of Nike Trainers hidden in his room.</p>
<p>18. The Supreme Leader is obsessed with basketball – an American 
game. Not just that, his favorite player is Michael Jordan – the 
superstar of Chicago Bulls when Kim was in school. One of his school 
mates reported that he made meticulous pencil sketches of Michael 
Jordan.</p>
<p>19. Kim Jong-Un’s best friend is? Guess, guess! Well, let us help. 
His best friend is Dennis Rodman – a live NBA star. It is reported that 
Rodman flew to North Korea in 2013 and 2014 to meet Kim Jong-Un and even
 carried luxury gifts worth millions of dollars for which, US Treasury 
Department investigated Rodman.</p>
<p class="">20. Kim Jong-Un is a fan of Johnnie Walker whiskey. His 
former chef revealed that the Supreme Leader imports Jonny Walker from 
Scotland at the cost of tens of thousands of pounds. He also likes Yves 
Saint Laurent Cigarette. He uses a tipple and a puff or two every night 
for relaxing.</p>
