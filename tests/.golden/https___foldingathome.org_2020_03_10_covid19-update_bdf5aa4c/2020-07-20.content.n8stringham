<p class="rm-manual"> March 10, 2020</p>
<p class="rm-manual">by <a href="https://foldingathome.org/author/john-chodera/" rel="author">John Chodera</a></p>
<p>This is an update on Folding@home’s efforts to assist researchers around the world taking up the global fight against <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">COVID-19</a>.</p>
<p>After initial quality control and limited testing phases, 
Folding@home team has released an initial wave of projects simulating 
potentially druggable protein targets from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2">SARS-CoV-2</a>
 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and the related SARS-CoV virus (for 
which more structural data is available) into full production on 
Folding@home. Many thanks to the large number of Folding@home donors who
 have assisted us thus far by running in beta or advanced modes.</p>
<p>This initial wave of projects focuses on better understanding how these coronaviruses interact with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2">human ACE2 receptor</a>
 required for viral entry into human host cells, and how researchers 
might be able to interfere with them through the design of new 
therapeutic antibodies or small molecules that might disrupt their 
interaction.</p>
<p>In the coming days, we hope to take advantage of some of the new 
structural biology and biochemical data that is being rapidly released 
by researchers around the world who are working to understand these 
viruses and strategies for defeating them. This work has been largely 
disseminated by preprint servers such as <a href="http://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a> and <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/">chemRxiv</a>,
 which aim to make research rapidly available to both other researchers 
and the public for other scientists to broadly evaluate and immediately 
start building on. We have also forged several new collaborations with 
other laboratories where we hope Folding@home will provide valuable 
support in COVID-19 research efforts.</p>
<p>While we will rapidly release the simulation datasets for others to 
use or analyze, we aim to look for alternative conformations and hidden 
pockets within the most promising drug targets, which can only be seen 
in simulation and not in static X-ray structures. We hope that these 
structures—once validated by emerging compound screening data—could help
 direct the virtual screening campaigns or the targeting of new pockets 
for which atomistic structures were not yet available.</p>
<p>Below, we provide short descriptions of the projects. Note that all 
input files are being made available on GitHub here for other 
researchers to take advantage of:</p>

<p>This repository will evolve over the coming days as we add more 
projects and documentation. We will start posting datasets with 
structures on publicly available servers as soon as we have useful data 
to report.</p>
<p>All projects are using the new GPU-accelerated Core22 based on the open source <a href="http://openmm.org/">OpenMM</a> biomolecular simulation engine.</p>
