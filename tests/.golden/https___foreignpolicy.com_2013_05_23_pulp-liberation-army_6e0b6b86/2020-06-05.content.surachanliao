<p class="rm-manual"> Larry Downing-Pool/Getty Images </p>
<p> It is the year 2049. China’s economic development has so disturbed 
the world’s other major powers that the United States, Japan, and Russia
 form an alliance and invade China. Fierce battles break out on the 
plains of northeast China, where Japanese troops and U.S. fighter jets 
besiege Chinese infantry. Caught by surprise, China’s army nonetheless 
stages a glorious counterattack by deploying levitating tanks, and 
employing a strategy based on lessons learned from the Anti-Japanese War
 and the Resist America War (better known in the West as WWII and the 
Korean War, respectively). </p>
<p> Such is the plot of <a href="http://www.junshishu.com/Book22187/">The Last Counterattack</a>, a serial novel published on <a href="http://www.junshishu.com/">Blood and Iron Reading,</a>
 a Chinese military literature website. In one of the latest 
installments, published on May 2, U.S. government-sponsored hackers have
 infiltrated the Chinese military’s network and accidently launched a 
Chinese nuclear missile directed at the United States. The anonymous 
author’s online profile says he is a former colonel in the People’s 
Liberation Army and currently a staff officer in charge of operations 
and reconnaissance in the 12th Armored Division at China’s 21st Army 
Group. Going by the online pseudonym "the Old Staff Officer," he told <span>FP</span>
 in an interview conducted over the Chinese messaging service QQ that he
 "enjoys the feeling of letting [his] imagination fly." But Li, as I’ll 
call him, believes that what he’s writing may actually come to pass. In 
an April blog <a href="http://blog.ifeng.com/article/25392549.html">post</a>, he explained his thinking for the book: "The world besieges China and attacks it from all sides. Is this possible? Yes!" </p>
<p> There are thousands of Chinese war fantasy novels on the Internet — 
too sensitive to be published in book form, they circulate on blogs, and
 websites like Blood and Iron Reading. Most languish, but the more 
popular ones get read millions of times. As a rising China struggles to 
define its military aspirations, and as the country’s vast propaganda 
apparatus encourages citizens to define their version of President Xi 
Jinping’s vague slogan "Chinese Dream," these military fantasy novels 
provide insight into what Chinese people’s war dreams look like. </p>
<p> The novels follow one of two distinctive patterns. Most take place 
in the past, often during periods when China suffered a series of 
traumatic invasions. "In China, science fiction demonstrates people’s 
hope to transcend reality, and the reality is that China often loses," 
says Wu Yan, an education professor at Beijing Normal University and a 
scholar of Chinese science fiction. (Military fantasy novels fit into 
this genre, though compared with other science fiction, tend to focus 
more on international relations and less on technology.) Some of the 
novels feature modern characters that travel back in time to defend 
China from humiliation. In 1894: China Rises, an unsuccessful 
businessman <a href="http://www.junshishu.com/Book16760/">finds himself</a>
 hurled back to 1883, the beginning of the Sino-French War, where he 
becomes an army general and defeats the invading French forces. Another 
novel, Resist Japan and Expel the Japanese Pirates, <a href="http://www.junshishu.com/Book20469/">tells</a>
 of an army major who returns to the Anti-Japanese War, and, armed with 
today’s technology, drives the Japanese forces out of Manchuria. Other 
novels, like The Last Counterattack, project into the near future, when 
China’s growth in economic and military strength prompts other major 
world powers to contain it through warfare. China always vanquishes 
these threats, however, through ingenious military strategies and 
advanced weaponry, and eventually gains the respect and prestige it 
deserves on the world stage. </p>
<p> Li declined to go into further detail about his thought process, 
saying he "doesn’t need fame," but he did mention his admiration for 
Caspar Weinberger, Ronald Reagan’s secretary of defense, and his book 
The Next War. Published in 1997, it imagines a series of regional 
conflicts arising out of the United States’ "<a href="http://www.chuckbaldwinlive.com/caspar.html">very deep cuts</a>"
 in military capability, including one in which a nuclear war breaks on 
the Korean Peninsula and China seizes the opportunity to conquer Taiwan.
 "Anybody who studies war should remember Weinberger," Li says. </p>
<p> Military fantasies are only a subset of a broader, thriving market 
in military books. Unlike in the United States, where Tom Clancy can 
imagine a scenario where Washington <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15985392-threat-vector">attacks</a>
 Beijing, Chinese censorship precludes their publishing in book form. "I
 was told by publishers that any novel that describes wars among 
different countries are strictly off-limits," says Zheng Jun, a 
Chongqing-based science fiction writer and an independent sci-fi 
literary agent who helps publishes close to 100 science fiction books 
each year. China "can only fight aliens or a fictional country," he 
says. The Golden Bullet Series, the last major Chinese military fantasy 
novels allowed to be published in book form, in 2003, accordingly 
focuses on conflicts between human beings and aliens or unidentified 
terrorists. </p>
<p> Such restrictions have led military fantasy writers to publish their
 work online, where censorship is less strict. Blood and Iron Reading, 
the largest web platform for military literature, provides roughly 2,500
 free military novels to download, and boasts an average of 30 million 
unique visitors per month. It is named after a famous speech delivered 
by German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1862, about the unification of
 German territories. "Bismarck is a popular figure among Chinese 
military aficionados," explains Jiang Lei, the website’s founder, in a 
2012 interview with the Chinese magazine People Weekly. </p>
<p> China has a long tradition of fantasy writing, from the 16th century
 novel Journey to the West, about a monkey who fights demons, to the 
18th-century ghost story collection Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio.
 But the utopia/dystopian tradition prevalent in Western science fiction
 is shorter in China — the first major work to explore it was the 1902 
book The Future of New China. Written by prominent early 20th-century 
scholar Liang Qichao, the book imagines China in 1962, when it has 
achieved constitutional democracy. Liang’s writings on the need for 
radical change in China had a big influence on Mao Zedong, who bought 
into the idea of constructing a future mortgaged on the present. (The 
chairman was less interested in constitutional democracy, however.) </p>
<p> After the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949, science fiction
 and fantasy novels became heavily guided by communist ideology. The 
goal of these literature works became describing "the future of 
communist society, free from class struggle and committed to the 
reconciliation of humanity and nature," wrote Wu, the Chinese sci-fi 
scholar, in an <a href="http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/abstracts/a119.html#yan">essay</a>
 titled "Great Wall Planet: Introducing Chinese Science Fiction." In an 
interview, he cited the story "A Fantasia of Communism," set in 2000 and
 written in 1958, during the Great Leap Forward. In it, a worker visits 
Beijing to report on his progress and meets a 107-year-old Chairman Mao 
amid "abundant vegetable gardens" and "automated factories that produce 
hundreds of thousands of tons of steel every day." </p>
<p> The novels have always been linked to China’s exploration of its 
national identity. "Chinese science fiction writers have been dreaming 
the Chinese dream since the end of the Qing dynasty," wrote Han Song, 
one of China’s best-known sci-fi writers,</p>
<p> in a blog <a href="http://hansong.blog.caixin.com/archives/55468">post</a> in April. "Now, we have the responsibility of dreaming a better dream," echoing Xi’s slogan, which he <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-11/29/c_132008231.htm">described</a>
 as "the great renewal of the Chinese nation" — often interpreted as a 
return to 18th- or 8th-century China, when the country dominated world 
affairs. </p>
<p> Many military fantasy novels use history as a mirror for 
self-examination. A large number portray the Chinese as valiant and 
fierce warriors unflinching in the face of foreign troops and weapons — 
very different from how they feel about themselves. "The so-called 
modern Chinese are in fact the post-Qing Chinese, castrated of their 
martial spirit," Li wrote in an April blog <a href="http://blog.ifeng.com/article/25392549.html">post</a>.
 Often, beneath a veneer of national pride flows an undercurrent of 
self-examination and criticism. Han’s novel 2066: Red Star Over America,
 portrays the United States in the throes of a Cultural Revolution, 
where bands of marauding U.S. students fight battles in the country’s 
ravaged countryside. China is the world’s top superpower, and an 
earthquake has sunk Japan, erasing it from the map. The protagonist, a 
Chinese Go player and diplomatic envoy, tries to return civilization to a
 crumbling United States. On the surface, the novel portrays a powerful 
future China and a decaying America — but another way to read it is as a
 subtle rebuke of the Chinese regime’s weakness and xenophobia during 
its own Cultural Revolution. </p>
<p> Another common theme running through the books is China — sometimes 
violently — forcing the world to become more harmonious. The motif is 
present in Liang’s The Future of New China, set at an international 
conference in Shanghai, in which countries from all over the world come 
to pay tribute to China, as well as in recent works such as Being with 
You, about a seven-man group that leads humans to resist the invasion of
 aliens. "Chinese science fiction writers are often preoccupied with the
 feeling that the world should be united," Wu says. "But they still seem
 to feel China is marginalized, not included in the world order." 
Throughout history, Li observes, China has often evoked suspicion and 
hostility abroad: "China’s biggest strength lies in its giant 
population, which is a major historical reason why it became known as 
the Yellow Peril." </p>
<p> In the United States, the term Yellow Peril originated in the late 
19th century and referred to the supposed dangers posed by Chinese 
immigrants working in Western countries. In China, the term is broader, 
referring to the prejudice and suppression Chinese experienced in the 
hands of Western imperial powers. The best-known recent use of the term 
is as the title of a 1991 dystopian novel by Beijing-based dissident 
writer Wang Lixiong, which is also probably the best-selling Chinese 
military fantasy novel (though mostly from international sales — it was 
banned in China). Yellow Peril imagines a civil war breaking out in 
China after the June 4, 1989, massacre in Tiananmen Square, unleashing 
hundreds of millions of Chinese refugees who cause international 
political mayhem by their sheer numbers. </p>
<p> Like Han’s 2066, many Chinese military fantasy novels feature the 
destruction of Japan. The most popular novel on Blood and Iron Reading 
is entitled Sino-Japanese War-The Prologue to World War 3, which has 
attracted more than 140 million pageviews. Gao Yan, a young woman who 
grew up near a military camp, started it in 2005 under the pen name "The
 Last Defender of Principles." The book envisions a full-scale 
Sino-Japanese War in the first decade of the 21st century, ignited by a 
naval clash between Japan and Taiwan near the disputed Diaoyu Islands, 
which the Japanese call the Senkakus. "The beginning of the novel is 
strong and realistic," one reader wrote in a <a href="http://bbs.tiexue.net/post2_2902433_1.html">book review</a>.
 "There has always been little trust and communication between us and 
those guys on that archipelago [Japan]. It’s never hard to imagine the 
hatred between the two peoples." In the preface to the novel, Gao writes
 that she thinks a war between China and Japan is inevitable: "China 
will only become a superpower after it has pushed Japan — the obstacle —
 aside." </p>
<p> Nearly half of Chinese TV dramas made in 2012 showcase that same 
animosity: They take place during World War II, with cartoonish levels 
of violence against Japanese: Chinese soldiers hurl grenades that bring 
down Japanese fighter jets and tear Japanese in half with their hands 
(picture Inglorious Bastards shot without any sense of irony, and with 
Japanese in the place of Nazis, and you get the idea). </p>
<p> Frustration with the Chinese military is another common theme. When <span>FP</span>
 mentions the fast development of Chinese weaponry and military to Li, 
he says, "Yes, but we never use it." During the anti-Japanese protests 
in August 2012, another military fantasy writer who goes by the name 
"Smoking Coffee" <a href="http://t.163.com/chouyandekafei/status/-2330082603050535180">vented</a>
 a similar feeling on his Weibo account. "The Chinese anger over the 
Diaoyu Islands dispute is not enough to start a war, and is still being 
suppressed by the state," he wrote. "I want to ask, how much longer is 
it going to be suppressed?" </p>
<p> In his April blog <a href="http://blog.ifeng.com/article/25392549.html">post</a>,
 Li describes the time when China was attacked by allied forces at the 
end of the Qing Dynasty, and draws sharp parallels to today. "In a 
word," he writes, "thinking of a war in which China is attacked by all 
sides is extremely necessary." </p>
