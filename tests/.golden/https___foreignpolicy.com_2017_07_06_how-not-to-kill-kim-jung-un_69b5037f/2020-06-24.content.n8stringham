<h2 class="rm-manual"> The history of failed attempts on the lives of Pyongyang’s leaders shows if you come for the Kims, you better not miss. </h2>
<p class="rm-manual"> By <span><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/author/adam-rawnsley">Adam Rawnsley</a></span> </p>
<p class="rm-manual">July 6, 2017</p>
<p>The two dozen commandos trained to kill North Korean dictator Kim Il 
Sung on a remote island off the coast of South Korea never made it to 
Pyongyang. The men of the 2325th Group’s 209th Detachment had been 
recruited from the country’s poor, desperate, and criminal and brought 
to Silmido Island to be trained to become assassins. To South Korea’s 
own authoritarian leaders in 1968, this meant they had to be hardened. 
They were abused, neglected, and put through grueling exercises with 
guards shooting at their feet and beating them with bats when they 
didn’t perform to expectations. Six of them were executed for 
disobedience; another drowned by accident.</p>
<p>Their mission was to infiltrate North Korea, sneak into one of Kim’s 
palaces, and murder the Great Leader, paying North Korea back in kind 
for a failed 1968 <a href="http://warisboring.com/north-koreas-special-operations-assassins/">special operations raid</a>
 aimed at assassinating South Korean President Park Chung-hee. By 1971, 
Park had given up on the prospect of revenge. The men of Silmido Island,
 however, had not. That year, they rose up, killing 18 of their guards 
with their honed commando skills and stealing a boat across the Yellow 
Sea to the port of Incheon. There they hijacked two buses and set out to
 Seoul to kill the men who had ordered them to be turned into weapons.</p>
<p>Like many attempts to kill members of the Kim dynasty both before and
 after, this one ended in ruin, blazing out in a hail of gunfire and 
grenade explosions as the remaining recruits fought a doomed battle with
 police in the South Korean capital.</p>
<p>But even if they had been launched against the North, their fate 
would have been the same. Even their handlers believed their chances of 
survival were slim — a fact they kept hidden from the commandos. The 
North had long proved inhospitable ground for infiltrators. South Korean
 intelligence had “made no serious effort” to carry out intelligence 
operations in the North in the late 1960s “because the expected losses 
of intelligence agents would be high and the benefits nil or virtually 
nil,” according to a declassified CIA report.</p>
<p>Nearly a half-century later, the Kim dynasty is still in power in North Korea, and <a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201706160037.html%20">talk of decapitation</a>
 is in the air once again. The pace of North Korea’s ballistic missile 
and nuclear weapons development has taken it from a national security 
sideshow to what Secretary of Defense James Mattis now calls the 
greatest threat to the United States. The options for halting the 
increasing reach of the North’s nuclear missiles — a catastrophic war or
 a politically unpalatable nonproliferation agreement that the North 
might cheat on — aren’t enviable, but the U.S. Defense Department has 
tried to develop military options, carrying out <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-drills-us-south-korea-practice-striking-norths-nuclear-plants/2016/03/06/46e6019d-5f04-4277-9b41-e02fc1c2e801_story.html?utm_term=.d7f1af8b6963">joint exercises</a> with South Korea in 2016 for a new plan that would involve strikes on North Korean leadership.</p>
<p>South Korea, for its part, has put its authoritarian past and 
personal revenge plots behind it. But fearful of the North’s growing 
nuclear and ballistic missile arsenal and irritated by its constant 
display, Seoul has begun to counter Pyongyang’s aggressive messages with
 <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2016/09/11/65/0301000000AEN20160911000500315F.html">threats</a> of its own to kill current leader Kim Jong Un at the outset of any war.</p>
<p>But long before Pyongyang began lighting off ballistic missiles and 
churning out nuclear warheads, the Kim dynasty has been facing down 
assassination threats, both real and imagined. From the days of Japanese
 colonialism in the 1930s through the turbulent end of communist regimes
 in the 1990s, many have tried (and failed) to kill a Kim. But despite 
facing lethal challenges from within and without, the dynasty has always
 managed to dodge would-be assassins thanks to canny survival skills, 
some less than fully baked plots, and an elaborate network of 
bodyguards, secret police, and informants.</p>
<p>All the Kims’ men</p>
<p>The Kim family’s first brush with death came in the 1930s, when Kim 
Il Sung joined the Chinese 1st Route Army as an insurgent in the 
resistance against Japanese colonial rule in Manchuria and Korea. Once 
Kim had made a name for himself in the resistance against Japanese 
occupation, Japanese police set up a designated “special activities 
unit” to <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/648873.pdf">hunt him down</a>,
 employing dozens of former guerrillas whom the Japanese lured from 
Kim’s unit by promising amnesty. Together with a network of police 
informants, the men stalked their former comrade and leader — a lesson 
in betrayal that Kim would remember for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Kim was protected during his guerrilla days by a band of bodyguards, 
which reportedly included his first wife, Kim Jong Suk, the mother of 
Kim Jong Il. North Korean histories of the period recount a battle in 
which Kim Jong Suk saved the future North Korean leader’s life in 
northeastern China, shielding Kim Il Sung from enemy soldiers taking aim
 at him from a nearby field of reeds and dropping the would-be assassins
 with her Mauser rifle. The tale has long been a propaganda parable 
about the need for absolute devotion to the Kims’ security, though 
there’s little independent evidence to back it up.</p>
<p>The first confirmed attempt on Kim Il Sung’s life in the postwar era —
 though not the last — came during a ceremony at the Pyongyang railway 
station commemorating the Korean independence movement on March 1, 1946.
 Assassins reportedly sent by the South Korean government threw a 
homemade grenade at the podium as Kim spoke, and Yakov Novichenko, a 
Soviet Army lieutenant guarding the assembled dignitaries, sprang into 
action and grabbed the grenade, which exploded in his hand, blowing off 
his arm. The incident spawned a <a href="https://www.nknews.org/2013/12/meet-the-man-who-saved-kim-il-sungs-life/">lifelong friendship</a> between Kim and Novichenko, as well as a cheesy <a href="https://youtu.be/3flBns_ANpU">Soviet-North Korean biopic</a>
 in the mid-1980s. (Leonid Vasin, an assistant section chief in the 
Soviet Army’s special propaganda section who worked closely with 
Pyongyang later, would in time write a more skeptical account of the 
incident. Vasin claimed that the homemade grenade landed about 100 feet 
from Kim and to the right of the podium, posing little threat.)</p>
<p>The coterie of guards surrounding Kim in the mid-1940s would 
eventually evolve into one of the world’s most repressive and pervasive 
police states, run for the personal benefit of the Kim family. Within 
that architecture of repression grew an elaborate praetorian guard for 
the North’s supreme leaders, protecting them with multiple, overlapping 
rings of security.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://nk.chosun.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=15397">innermost ring</a>
 are five to six elite, handpicked bodyguards from the brigade-sized 
Office of Adjutants, also known as Office No. 6, who directly protect 
the Kims. (It’s the loose equivalent of the U.S. Secret Service — except
 with 20 times as many people, in a country a fraction of the size of 
America.) The Kims’ personal guards are senior officers who have proved 
their reliability and loyalty through years of service in North Korea’s 
Guard Command, a 100,000-member <a href="https://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/HRNK_Gause_NKHOC_FINAL.pdf">unit</a>
 devoted to the security of the Kim family and the upper levels of North
 Korean officialdom. Other Guard Command soldiers, picked from families 
with no known ties to Pyongyang’s communist elite, provide the next 
layers of protection around Kim Jong Un, surrounding him at events, 
official visits, and on personal travel, as well as protecting his 
various residences.</p>
<p>The capital itself is protected by the Pyongyang Defense Command and 
Pyongyang Air Defense Command, which would fight within the city and 
defend its airspace in the event of a major war or coup attempt. Outside
 of Pyongyang, the 3rd Corps of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) comprises
 the final, most heavily armed ring, guarding the western approaches to 
Pyongyang from the port of Nampo north to the Chongchon River.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/HRNK_Gause_NKHOC_FINAL.pdf">handful of agencies</a>
 also conduct surveillance within the North to act as an early tripwire 
for signs of disloyalty and coup plots in the making. The State Security
 Department runs an expansive network of eavesdropping and informants to
 spy on North Korean civilians while the more sensitive work of 
surveilling senior Workers’ Party officials is carried out by the 
Organization and Guidance Department. Within the KPA, the Military 
Security Command acts as a kind of parallel secret police to keep tabs 
on those in uniform.</p>
<p>Together, the domestic intelligence and security agencies are aided 
by the cultivation of a Kim personality cult, which emphasizes the 
worship of the Kim family as essentially supernatural beings. Attempting
 to kill a Kim, for many North Koreans, would be more than treason — it 
would be blasphemy. Like Chinese emperors, the North Korean state, too, 
promises suffering not only to “traitors” but to their families, further
 deterring any attempt.</p>
<p>The not-so-glorious 1990s</p>
<p>The greatest test of the security apparatus protecting the Kims came 
in the 1990s as North Korea transitioned from the leadership of Kim Il 
Sung to his son Kim Jong Il. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 
Soviet Union, communist states were crumbling, and many wondered if 
North Korea would be the next to go. In addition to the geopolitical 
shift, there were also whiffs of discontent about Kim Jong Il’s position
 as his father’s heir.</p>
<p>Rumors of coup plots and assassination attempts began to trickle out 
of the North and into Japanese and South Korean media. In the early 
’90s, news outlets began to report on a supposed assassination plot led 
by Col. Gen. An Chang Ho and 30-40 military officers who had all studied
 at the Frunze Military Academy in the Soviet Union. The plotters 
purportedly planned to turn their tanks’ guns on the two Kims during an 
April 1992 military parade commemorating the 60th anniversary of the 
founding of the KPA.</p>
<p>“There is a lot of sourcing — from media reports to defector 
interview data — that establishes that An was dismissed and arrested and
 that alumna of Russian and East European military universities were 
subject to investigations,” says Michael Madden, a visiting scholar at 
Johns Hopkins University and an expert on North Korean leadership. 
“Whether An actually participated in an assassination attempt or violent
 power challenge is a different matter altogether.”</p>
<p>Shortly after the death of Kim Il Sung, the KPA’s 6th Corps, based in
 North Hamgyong province, supposedly went on the move in 1995 with the 
aim of mounting a coup. “The plot was uncovered by elements within the 
6th Corps itself, so it wasn’t as if it was found out by the security 
services,” says Ken Gause, the director of the international affairs 
group at CNA, a nonprofit research and analysis organization, and an 
expert on North Korean security institutions. “It was mainly the head of
 the 6th Corps [Kim Yong Chun] going to the head of the State Security 
Department and basically ratting out his own corps.”</p>
<p>What really happened in North Hamgyong — whether it was the beginning
 of a coup or a grab for resources, as Gause suspects — is still a 
matter of some debate and mystery. In any case, the incident represented
 a worrying breakdown in command for a system premised on absolute 
control.</p>
<p>There were repercussions for the 6th Corps.</p>
<p>“The most credible story is that they tied the senior military 
command of the 6th Corps in a barracks building and then set the 
building on fire,” Madden says. Today, the 6th Corps has been blotted 
from the records.</p>
<p>Reviewing the options</p>
<p>Kim Jong Il rode out the rocky years of the 1990s and consolidated 
his power enough to ensure another hereditary transition of power to his
 son Kim Jong Un. But the prospect of a nuclear strike, made more likely
 by Pyongyang’s progress in weapons development, has given new urgency 
to efforts to disrupt the North’s chain of command in the event of war 
in a preemptive strike.</p>
<p>“This is not anything unusual. People are publicizing it, making a 
big deal out of it, but there are many leadership targets in North 
Korea,” says retired Army Col. David Maxwell, a former Special Forces 
officer who served with U.S. Special Operations Command Korea. “All of 
the command and control facilities, all of the relocation facilities 
from Pyongyang, the villas that Kim Jong Un might use during time of war
 — all of these are potential targets, at minimum, for surveillance and,
 in extremis, to target people that are at those leadership locations.”</p>
<p>While knocking out enemy leadership in a war is hardly a new idea, 
the South Korean military has gotten more vocal about its decapitation 
capabilities in recent years. South Korea’s Army Special Warfare Command
 announced in 2016 that it was standing up a special operations unit 
tasked with <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2016/10/12/0401000000AEN20161012005151315.html">killing Kim Jong In</a>
 and other senior leaders in the event a preemptive strike became 
necessary. For its part, North Korea has accused its adversaries in 
Washington and Seoul of a <a href="http://kcna.co.jp/item/2017/201705/news05/20170505-09ee.html">bizarre plot</a> to “commit state-sponsored terrorism against the supreme leadership of the DPRK by use of bio-chemical substance.”</p>
<p>But any special operations team would face steep hurdles in getting close enough to Kim Jong Un to kill him.</p>
<p>First, South Korean special operators would have to hitch a ride with
 their American counterparts in the U.S. Air Force Special Operations or
 the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to infiltrate the North.
 Once across the Northern Limit Line, a team would then have to make it 
past the KPA’s 3rd Corps, which defends the approaches to the capital 
against invaders looking to land at Nampo and take the highway up or 
drop from the sky in an airborne assault.</p>
<p>“If the defense by the 3rd Corps and the 4th Corps has failed, the 
[soldiers of the Pyongyang Defense Command] plan to defend the city 
section by section, giving time for Kim Jong Un and the Guard Command to
 move the leadership out into the north-central part of the country,” 
says Joseph Bermudez, an expert on the North Korean military.</p>
<p>American special operators have carried out multiple such raids in 
places like Pakistan, Somalia, and Libya since 9/11, swooping in with 
stealth and speed to capture or kill terrorist leaders on the run. 
Trying to replicate those feats against a heavily armed nation-state 
lengthens the odds considerably. “It looks good in the movies, but it’s 
not something that is easily done,” Maxwell says.</p>
<p>The most practical method might be a missile barrage by either the 
United States or South Korea. The South’s “Korea Massive Punishment and 
Retaliation” plan, announced after the North’s September 2016 nuclear 
test, calls for ballistic and cruise missiles to <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2016/09/11/65/0301000000AEN20160911000500315F.html">flatten sections of Pyongyang</a>
 associated with Kim Jong Un and his commanders should a nuclear strike 
appear imminent. Four years before the plan’s rollout, Seoul tipped its 
hand with the public test of a Hyunmoo-3 cruise missile, shown <a href="http://www.38north.org/2013/02/jlewis022613/">smashing</a> into a target crafted in the shape of Pyongyang’s Kumsusan Palace of the Sun.</p>
<p>But all the missiles and special operators are useless unless they 
have good intelligence to guide them to a leader’s location. Getting 
that kind of sensitive information in a hard target like North Korea can
 be a quixotic quest, but that hasn’t dimmed the appetite for the 
enterprise, says Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia 
nonproliferation program at the Middlebury Institute of International 
Studies. “Although it never really works, military and political leaders
 are always drawn to decapitation. It’s catnip for idiots.”</p>
<p>Lewis points to the 2003 invasion of Iraq as an example of the 
problems such missions are likely to hit. In that case, the United 
States sent stealth aircraft loaded with bunker-buster bombs and cruise 
missiles to strike a site where American spies believed Saddam Hussein 
was hiding. Saddam wasn’t there, nor were any leadership bunkers, and 
the Iraqi dictator wouldn’t be caught for another eight months.</p>
<p>The day after</p>
<p>But even in a scenario where the United States or South Korea 
succeeds in a preemptive strike against Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s 
conventional military capabilities ensure that it’s still capable of 
inflicting catastrophic damage on the South, where the United States has
 thousands of troops deployed. Nor is it necessarily clear that the KPA 
would throw down its weapons in the wake of Kim’s death. Secretary of 
Defense James Mattis has assured U.S. lawmakers that even though the 
United States would prevail in a war against the North, any conflict 
would be “more serious in terms of human suffering than anything we have
 seen since 1953.”</p>
<p>The North’s problems won’t end after Kim Jong Un because the Kim 
family inheritance encompasses more than just the flesh-and-blood heirs 
to the throne of Pyongyang. The North’s royal family planted deep roots 
in North Korean society in the form of decades of brutal misrule and 
penury inflicted upon its subjects. That bodes poorly for the country’s 
ability to quickly erect a better society from the ashes of any future 
conflict. In the end, North Koreans will be tormented by the ghosts of 
their supreme leaders long after the last Kim is gone from power.</p>
<p>Removing the last Kim — as catastrophically bloody as it would be — 
might be relatively easy compared with governing the chaotic kingdom 
left behind.</p>
