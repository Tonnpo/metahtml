<p> Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump gives two thumbs at the 
Republican National Convention on July 21, 2016, in Cleveland, Ohio. 
(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) </p>
<p>From the perspective of foreign policy and national security policy 
veterans from previous Republican administrations, 2017 was a remarkable
 year.</p>
<p>Yes, there was a Republican in the White House, who gradually (albeit
 ever so slowly) filled his administration with respected members of our
 tribe.</p>
<p>But along the way, many of the debates that our side of the aisle had settled long ago seemed up for grabs:</p>
<p>— On balance, is an open, globalized trading system a net positive or a net negative for the United States?</p>
<p>— On balance, do allies bring more opportunity or more challenges for advancing American interests?</p>
<p>— Can American interests truly advance if we strip away American values and principles?</p>
<p>— Is it in America’s long-term interest to bear a lion’s share of the short-term costs of underwriting the global order?</p>
<p>— If an adversary attacks U.S. democratic institutions and tries to 
undermine the electoral system, should that adversary be confronted or 
coddled?</p>
<p>Yet when the Trump administration released its <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf">National Security Strategy</a>
 this month, it seemed to resolve many (though not all) of those debates
 in favor of the traditional Republican formula that has been the key to
 America’s success since World War II.</p>
<p>And yet reasonable people can ask how we should weigh the different 
indicators — formal set-piece rhetoric from interagency documents versus
 impromptu reflexive rhetoric from the commander-in-chief, noble 
intentions versus actual behavior, and so on.</p>
<p>To help us make sense of a bewildering year, we have asked our herd 
of Elephants to weigh in with brief posts responding to the following 
prompt: Identify one good thing and one bad thing from President Donald 
Trump’s first year at the helm.</p>
<p>Here, in alphabetical order, is the parade:</p>
<p>Peter Feaver</p>
<p>The good. During the 2016 election campaign, I <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/23/is-this-the-trump-list-we-have-been-waiting-for/">worried</a>
 that candidate Trump was not assembling a quality team of national 
security and foreign policy advisors. Admittedly, I made that problem 
worse by <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/">signing</a> the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html?_r=0">various</a> letters (and organizing <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/04/defending-the-honor-of-the-u-s-military-from-donald-trump/">one</a>
 in my own bailiwick), which had the collective effect of simultaneously
 burnishing Trump’s brand as anti-establishment whilst also making it 
harder for quality establishment voices to gain influence on the 
campaign. Yet, when Trump won, I <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/09/can-donald-trump-be-a-good-president/">urged</a>
 my colleagues to join the administration if they could so as to provide
 Trump with a strong team. The administration has been painfully slow in
 filling its ranks — and there have been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/michael-flynn-guilty-russia-investigation.html">few</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/steve-bannon-declares-season-war-against-gop-establishment-n810731">bad</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/8/25/15505180/sebastian-gorka-out-resign">choices</a>
 along the way — but overall I have thought the caliber of the 
individuals selected at the cabinet and subcabinet levels has been 
better than I feared it would be.</p>
<p>The bad. While the individual players have been better than expected,
 I still worry about the collective imbalance on the team. Trump has 
relied too heavily on members of the military — active and recently 
retired — to fill out senior civilian slots. I have supported every one 
of the selections on the current roster, but I wish the president could 
find stronger civilian voices for national security posts. The problem 
is compounded by the fact that the area where the administration has 
struggled the most in terms of personnel is the State Department, 
customarily the lead civilian agency. Towards the end of 2017, things 
started to look up a bit, with strong choices at the under and assistant
 secretary levels in both State and the Department of Defense, but the 
administration is still well behind where it needs to be given the 
daunting array of challenges facing the team in the coming year.</p>
<p>Michael Green</p>
<p>The good. The National Security Strategy. H.R. McMaster, Trump’s 
national security advisor, and Nadia Schadlow, the senior director for 
strategy on the National Security Council, put together a strategy <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf">document</a>
 for the president that offers friends and allies abroad something on 
which to hang their own strategic hats. It was flawed in terms of ways 
and means (no trade strategy, weak on human rights, under-resourced in 
terms of diplomacy), but it was the first such strategy in a generation 
to clarify that the United States would compete to maintain primacy in 
the face of great power rivalry, particularly in Asia. Criticism by 
former Obama advisors that the document was a failure because it ignored
 climate change as a national security threat only amplified the 
previous administration’s inability to recognize that rival powers were 
eating their lunch. It was good to finish the year on that positive 
note. Still, while we know that the president read his inaugural address
 in advance, it appears he did not read the entire strategy document. 
2018 could be a challenging year in terms of national security.</p>
<p>The bad. The Inaugural address. Where friends and allies around the 
world look to new presidents’ inaugural addresses in hopes of seeing 
Aragorn, they heard from Trump only Gollum. The inaugural speech oozed 
with resentment, protectionism, and retrenchment. There was not one 
sentence that would reassure an ally standing on the front lines of 
freedom, on the Korean Demilitarized Zone or a prisoner of conscience 
alone in a cell in Caracas. If it was true that former President George 
W. Bush muttered, “that was some weird shit” at the end (and three 
witnesses near the dais said he did), then he was being generous.</p>
<p>Celeste Ward Gventer</p>
<p>The good. The Trump administration deserves credit for its recent 
decision to provide Ukraine with a significant increase in its military 
capabilities against Russian-backed separatists in the country’s east. 
In particular, the United States will now <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.washingtonpost.com_politics_officials-2Dus-2Dagrees-2Dto-2Dprovide-2Dlethal-2Dweapons-2Dto-2Dukraine_2017_12_22_a29a37d2-2De788-2D11e7-2D927a-2De72eac1e73b6-5Fstory.html-3Futm-5Fterm-3D.ca8dac0da6b0&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=8IRmGnH6osAeqcuGsOx-IQ&amp;m=Fi5J2o8IeIZjRfb2DcflNDy-U580BTPDdb0de51ziF8&amp;s=eHo2CSI8rCGXtRvsD_5lBX_isj0QFu96WcDOTWwFw9g&amp;e=">provide</a>
 Javelin anti-tank weapons to the Ukrainian armed forces, a capability 
Kiev has urgently requested for years. There are risks to this, not 
least that the weapons may quickly end up in the hands of pro-Russian 
separatists or the Russian military, or that the transfer of weapons may
 escalate the conflict, as some observers have <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.nytimes.com_2017_08_25_opinion_united-2Dstates-2Darm-2Dukraine-2Dmissiles.html&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=8IRmGnH6osAeqcuGsOx-IQ&amp;m=Fi5J2o8IeIZjRfb2DcflNDy-U580BTPDdb0de51ziF8&amp;s=2w_GY4_QO99u_KZ5xxnghN5m5gLtXU2uiL8B0HXGQCI&amp;e=">warned</a>.
 But the move clearly signals the kind of decisiveness that was sorely 
lacking in the waning days of the Obama administration. After the 
Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014, and until the end of 
the Obama years, the Russians were allowed to pummel the Ukrainians with
 virtual impunity. The United States provided limited and strictly 
defensive equipment and training, and that assistance increased over 
time, but the ambivalence and hesitation in the White House was palpable
 on the ground in Ukraine. Such caution may well have been read by the 
likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin as irresolution or 
indifference. The Ukrainians are and will remain overmatched by the 
Russian military, Javelins or no Javelins. But greater capabilities will
 allow them to extract higher costs for Russian shenanigans in their 
sovereign territory, which may just be enough to change the calculus in 
Moscow. One possible interpretation of the <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.nytimes.com_2017_12_27_world_europe_ukraine-2Dprisoner-2Dexchange.html&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=8IRmGnH6osAeqcuGsOx-IQ&amp;m=Fi5J2o8IeIZjRfb2DcflNDy-U580BTPDdb0de51ziF8&amp;s=UweCvYqNfkkHJ49UGNBk9oAUluawrXjhH8ZlRcOfe_U&amp;e=">recent prisoner exchange</a>
 between separatists and the Ukrainian armed forces is that Russia is 
growing weary of the expenditure in lives and rubles required to 
continue the conflict in eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>The bad. Unfortunately, the move seems to be a strong tactic that is 
disconnected from any larger approach to Ukraine, Europe, and Russia. As
 Elephants in the Room’s Will Inboden notes, despite the strong words of
 the new National Security Strategy concerning Moscow’s hostile 
intentions towards the United States, Washington’s meager response to 
Russian meddling in the U.S. democratic process is deeply concerning, as
 are the contradictory messages from various corners of the 
administration about the nature and scale of threats emanating from the 
Kremlin. To give the Ukrainians more capable weapons systems without a 
larger strategy will not allow Kiev to beat back the separatists and 
join the happy family of Western democracies. Stubborn political facts 
will persist: Ukraine’s historical relationship with Russia, its highly 
fragile democracy, persistent corruption and <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.bbc.com_news_world-2Deurope-2D42446865&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=8IRmGnH6osAeqcuGsOx-IQ&amp;m=Fi5J2o8IeIZjRfb2DcflNDy-U580BTPDdb0de51ziF8&amp;s=MlrItmjKYp49WV_wHtPhQffNAQda930FKJ1UulBnoUg&amp;e=">penetration by Russian agents</a>, and the <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.brookings.edu_blog_order-2Dfrom-2Dchaos_2017_07_25_will-2Dukraine-2Djoin-2Dnato-2Da-2Dcourse-2Dfor-2Ddisappointment_&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=8IRmGnH6osAeqcuGsOx-IQ&amp;m=Fi5J2o8IeIZjRfb2DcflNDy-U580BTPDdb0de51ziF8&amp;s=crfq6OaIb8-f5amem-5aKP4Kk9XUy_lr-PdUV8pnSAE&amp;e=">skeptical attitude</a>
 of the major European powers towards Ukrainian membership in their 
clubs, for starters. Ukraine will hold national elections in 2019, and 
of one thing we can be certain: Russia’s efforts to steer the outcome in
 Kiev will make Moscow’s 2016 interference in the U.S. vote look like a 
high school hackathon. All of these realities will require a more 
considered, coordinated approach to the problem and to the region than 
the administration has shown to date, and clearer messages about just 
how the United States intends to deal with Russian intentions, 
capabilities, and actions, in Europe and around the world.</p>
<p>Will Inboden</p>
<p>The Good. The Trump administration achieved several foreign policy 
successes during its first year. Most of them came in the Middle East, 
including restoring the U.S.-Israel relationship, repairing America’s 
eroded relations with Sunni Arab powers such as Saudi Arabia and the 
United Arab Emirates, and bringing the erstwhile Islamic State caliphate
 to the brink of complete destruction in Iraq and Syria (though the 
threat from the extended Islamic States network remains acute). But in 
my estimation the administration’s most notable achievement took place 
in Asia, and that is the multipronged and multilateral pressure campaign
 it has mounted against North Korea. Through a combination of U.N. 
Security Council resolutions, bilateral diplomacy with China, and 
unilateral measures, the United States has subjected Kim Jong Un’s 
regime to vice tightening at a level not seen since the George W. Bush 
administration’s sanctions on Banco Delta Asia in 2005. The best hope 
for curtailing North Korea’s nuclear arsenal short of war (itself a 
catastrophic option) lies in undermining Kim’s hold on power by choking 
off his revenue streams — the money laundering, smuggling, trafficking, 
indentured servitude, and other illicit activities that fuel his regime 
and enable the indolent lifestyle that he and his inner circle of 
cronies enjoy. The Trump administration is off to a good start in this 
respect, though the hardest road still lies ahead.</p>
<p>The bad. The administration also had its share of failures and 
setbacks in its first year, most of them attributable to Trump himself. I
 fear that, as Elephants in the Room’s Nicole Bibbins Sedaca points out,
 the most long-term harm will result from Trump’s abdication of 
America’s historic role as a global champion of democracy and human 
rights. At our current juncture, however, the administration’s biggest 
failure is its refusal to respond to Russia’s ongoing information 
warfare against the United States. America’s insipid response to 
Russia’s attacks during the 2016 campaign was bad enough, but even worse
 is America’s lack of aggressive prevention and retaliation against 
Russia’s continuing efforts to divide, demoralize, and weaken the United
 States. (For a compelling tracking of Russia’s current campaign, see 
the invaluable <a href="http://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/">Alliance for Securing Democracy dashboard</a>,
 administered by the German Marshall Fund of the United States). This 
may reveal the biggest division between Trump and the rest of his 
administration. While the National Security Strategy <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf">issued</a>
 this month by the White House portrays forthrightly a clear and 
accurate picture of Russia’s malevolent designs and threats to American 
interests, Trump himself <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/national-security/donald-trump-pursues-vladimir-putin-russian-election-hacking/?utm_term=.30372e7c82b8&amp;wpisrc=nl_popup&amp;wpmm=1">refuses to acknowledge</a>
 the Kremlin’s campaign, let alone do anything about it. Meanwhile, 
Putin continues to lock in Russia’s gains in the Middle East, engage in 
hybrid warfare against Ukraine, threaten America’s NATO allies, covertly
 support North Korea, and target his few remaining domestic critics, 
such as Alexi Navalny. Trump needs to reverse course on Russia very 
soon, lest he become a latter-day <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-the-left-longed-for-russian-political-interference">Henry Wallace</a>.</p>
<p>Ash Jain</p>
<p>The good. The best of the Trump administration’s foreign policy moves
 have been in the Asia-Pacific, where the United States has been strong 
and clear in reaffirming its commitment to its democratic allies. 
Trump’s largely successful visits to Japan and South Korea were 
indicative of this effort, as was the administration’s decision to 
revive the Asia-Pacific Quad — a strategic dialogue between Australia, 
India, Japan, and the United States, that met for the first time in a 
decade in November. This dialogue represents a worthwhile attempt to 
integrate India and deepen cooperation within a network of democratic 
allies in the Asia-Pacific, and has real potential to advance American 
interests in the region going forward.</p>
<p>The bad. While the Trump administration managed to avoid any major 
foreign policy catastrophes in 2017, its worst moves had to do with 
Russia — and Trump’s failure to recognize the serious threat to U.S. 
national security interests posed by Putin. The administration has done 
virtually nothing in the face of Russia’s unprecedented, active campaign
 to subvert American democracy, and has stood by as Moscow consolidated 
its biggest foreign policy success in 2017 — the resurrection of Syrian 
President Bashar al-Assad. While he reluctantly signed a sanctions bill 
and permitted arms sales to Ukraine, Trump, for reasons unknown, still 
sees a friend in Putin. The danger of this blind-eye policy toward 
Russia may be in what is yet to come. Moscow could interpret the 
administration’s reticence to act as a green light to pursue a more 
aggressive strategy to undermine U.S. interests in the coming year.</p>
<p>Phil Levy</p>
<p>The good. The U.S. pullback from its traditional leadership role has 
had some salutary effects, alongside the obvious costs. Allies who have 
in the past sometimes stood in the shadows of U.S. initiatives have 
taken on larger roles in promoting and maintaining the global system. 
Similarly, it was positive that countries such as Mexico, Canada, and 
China demonstrated maturity in not responding temperately to unusual 
provocations emanating from Washington.</p>
<p>The bad. The decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership 
(TPP). The repercussions were felt throughout the year. There was a 
direct commercial cost: It was an agreement that offered the United 
States important gains at minimal cost. It cast into doubt U.S. 
commitment to the Asia-Pacific (even if we call it the Indo-Pacific). It
 called into question the reliability of the United States as a partner,
 given the political capital other countries had expended to strike the 
deal. It left the Trump administration fuming about Chinese trade 
practices, but devoid of effective tools to address them. Further, it 
has stymied the entire vision of new, better trade deals, since the 
rejection of the TPP marked the rejection of a modern consensus about 
how to address trade policy. That left countries such as Japan 
distinctly unenthusiastic about engaging in bilateral talks — an 
impressive set of accomplishments for Trump’s first week in office.</p>
<p>Peter Rough </p>
<p>The good. Trump likes to contrast his principled realism to the 
progressive idealism of his predecessor. As much as anywhere, this 
change in presidential attitude was badly needed in the energy sector, 
where the Trump administration is liberating American hydrocarbons made 
accessible by the fracking revolution. Days after his inauguration, 
Trump began fast-tracking approval for the Dakota Access and Keystone XL
 pipelines. This month, he signed legislation authorizing drilling in 
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In between, the administration 
championed the export of liquified natural gas and eliminated excessive 
regulations that had stymied suppliers.</p>
<p>A thriving energy sector is central to the Trump administration’s 
goal of rebuilding the American economy, specifically manufacturing. But
 it also has an underappreciated impact on the global balance of power. 
The United States can now export gas to Europeans previously dependent 
on Russia, supply major allies like Japan, and build relations with 
third-party countries like India. Moreover, fracking in the United 
States has sent global oil prices tumbling, strengthening America’s 
European allies while undermining Russia, Iran, and Venezuela — three of
 the most stridently anti-American oil producers in the world. In its 
first year, the Trump administration has extended America’s lead in a 
sector that will shape the geopolitics of the future. This is what an 
“America First” foreign policy looks like at its best.</p>
<p>The bad. Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly denounced Iran for
 its malignant behavior in the Middle East — a refreshing change from 
his predecessor. In October, he even delivered a major address from the 
White House that promised to confront rather than accommodate Iran. 
These pronouncements deserve better implementation, however. For 
example, three days after the president’s address, Iraqi Prime Minister 
Haider al-Abadi launched a surprise offensive with Iranian backing to 
capture Kurdish controlled areas of Iraq, including the oil-rich city of
 Kirkuk. Iraq’s Kurds have long been loyal allies of the United States. 
And yet, the United States looked on as Abadi strengthened Iran’s hand 
and weakened the United States — and this only days after the president 
promised the opposite.</p>
<p>The Trump administration faces the daunting task of reversing an 
Iranian breakout in the region. Reestablishing and safeguarding the 
U.S.-led regional order against Iran will require a sustained U.S. 
commitment that no president, including Trump, would want to undertake. 
Instead, in its first year, the Trump administration focused its sights 
on defeating Islamic State. However, the president’s remarks and his 
cruise missile strike in April against a Syrian airfield in response to 
Assad’s gassing of civilians raised expectations across the region that 
the United States was ready to take on Iran. In 2018, the Trump 
administration should fulfill those expectations.</p>
<p>Daniel Runde</p>
<p>The Good. The Trump administration has come to see China as a 
credible global competitor and is using this prism to make a series of 
important decisions. The Trump team is also placing serious people in 
serious foreign policy and national security jobs, and the evolving 
policies coming out of the White House reflect these staffing decisions.
 One example of positive learning on the job is advancement in the area 
of <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.csis.org_analysis_dfis-2Ddrive-2Ddevelopment-2Dagenda-2Dcenter-2Dstage&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=8IRmGnH6osAeqcuGsOx-IQ&amp;m=XSz0KJQ5ZBUz_CR6Ym07Itwff1wFAjxvtLmZsqPdpFc&amp;s=cytb43ij64t3faPm2_vE9vc18b7h3CfIQVVu6yIJhLU&amp;e=">Development Finance Institutions</a>
 (DFIs). These institutions are exploding in growth because of the 
changing nature of most developing countries: They are richer, freer, 
and more prosperous than before, so they need different things from 
United States, usually to do with trade and investment. The Trump 
administration’s original skinny budget envisioned closing the U.S. 
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the U.S. Trade and 
Development Agency. These actions would have been incredibly 
counterproductive for American jobs and American businesses, as well as 
for finding ways to <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__docs.house.gov_meetings_FA_FA05_20171115_106635_HHRG-2D115-2DFA05-2DWstate-2DRundeD-2D20171115.pdf&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=8IRmGnH6osAeqcuGsOx-IQ&amp;m=XSz0KJQ5ZBUz_CR6Ym07Itwff1wFAjxvtLmZsqPdpFc&amp;s=_Ca3CbRlHiuet_BROmxDcRXWFEBQvmR7tnSMmwty0dI&amp;e=">respond to China</a>.
 Thankfully, Congress ensured continued funding for these institutions. 
Then the Trump administration named a great team to OPIC and began to 
look for ways to grow it, or even create a new DFI. These positive 
changes are a result of the realization that China is not an emerging 
soft-power competitor, but a fully emerged one. This recognition by the 
Trump administration that the United States needs to grow soft power 
tools to counter China is really great news. The new National Security 
Strategy is well within the tradition of bipartisan foreign policy. And 
the strategy document interestingly <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.opic.gov_press-2Dreleases_2017_opic-2Dstatement-2Dpresident-2Dtrumps-2Dnational-2Dsecurity-2Dstrategy&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=8IRmGnH6osAeqcuGsOx-IQ&amp;m=XSz0KJQ5ZBUz_CR6Ym07Itwff1wFAjxvtLmZsqPdpFc&amp;s=6wZLFeSaX1YuL_9OvQI8I6vZkwHWE8phdofvgIpa3jg&amp;e=">makes reference</a> to development finance.</p>
<p>The bad. The administration erred in exiting the TPP — a big 
potential Asia-Pacific trading bloc excluding China that was envisioned 
at the end of George W. Bush’s presidency. As time goes on, I think the 
United States will regret this early Trump decision, as China fills that
 economic space instead. The best way to fix this would be a series of 
bilateral trade agreements (something the Trump administration is very 
open to), starting with Japan right now, and perhaps in a second Trump 
term, revisiting TPP (or an adjusted TPP) with the intention of putting 
it back together. All U.S. trade agreements come with larger 
geo-economic considerations. In that vein, the worst thing that could 
happen in 2018 is for the Trump administration to <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.csis.org_analysis_avoid-2Damerican-2Dbrexit-2Dnafta&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=8IRmGnH6osAeqcuGsOx-IQ&amp;m=XSz0KJQ5ZBUz_CR6Ym07Itwff1wFAjxvtLmZsqPdpFc&amp;s=TW4B2CFG9vZhcctVqTqcP6FaGMpVly7FW2qfW2q9Ze8&amp;e=">exit</a> the North American Free Trade Agreement. Among the other bad consequences, Mexico and Canada would turn to China.</p>
<p>Kori Schake</p>
<p>The Good. Punishing the Assad government for using chemical weapons. 
Not only was it morally satisfying that some country would finally put a
 constraint on the barbarity with which Assad is torturing the people of
 Syria into submission — it also sent an important signal to the 
Russians that the United States would act despite their support for 
Assad. The operation was undertaken carefully, with the United States 
fully informing the Russians of what was coming so as to reduce the risk
 of stumbling into a U.S.-Russia confrontation. It announced the 
administration’s willingness to act to uphold international norms from 
which Americans and so many others benefit — a reminder (albeit a 
limited one) that the United States is different and better than the 
Syrian/Iranian/Russian side of that grisly war. Sadly, it was a false 
dawn.</p>
<p>The bad. The administration is burning through international 
goodwill, underestimating the value of others giving the United States 
the benefit of the doubt. The president seems to think there is no 
downside to calling fundamental and long-agreed-upon elements of the 
international order and the terms by which America leads it. That is 
incorrect. More Germans now consider Russia trustworthy than consider 
the United States to be. That will matter when we ask the German 
government to do hard things like sustain costly sanctions or go to war 
by America’s side. The best-kept secret of American hegemony is that 
most countries actually want us to succeed and help us. If they didn’t, 
the cost of sustaining the order would skyrocket. The president is 
removing one of America’s most salient and cost-effective tools: the 
power of inspiration.</p>
<p>Nicole Bibbins Sedaca</p>
<p>The Good. President Donald Trump’s Aug. 2017 decision to cut close to
 $100 million in assistance and withhold another $195 million in aid to 
Egypt, pending improvement in the country’s human rights and democracy 
record, was the right thing to do. The United States has too often shied
 away from tough responses to Egypt’s human rights abuses and crackdowns
 on political oppositions and civil society activists, given U.S. 
security interests. Parallel engagement on security issues and a tough 
line on human rights abuses and democratic development will better serve
 these longer-term security interests. Trump and his team have often 
touted his willingness to buck the conventional wisdom and keep others 
on their toes; here is one case where that approach resulted in the 
right foreign policy decision.</p>
<p>The bad. Trump’s stated retreat from promoting universal human rights
 and democratic values, combined with his domestic attacks on 
foundational American democratic institutions and values, have further 
undermined American global leadership on human rights and democracy 
promotion. (Obama began the significant turn away from these values in 
his foreign policy.) At a time when authoritarian governments are 
consolidating their grip, the absence of consistent, principled American
 leadership on these issues is a clear green light to these governments —
 as well as to illiberal nonstate actors — that they can continue with 
no challenge from the United States. Without American leadership, there 
is no consistent voice to motivate the international community. Trump’s 
domestic actions — equivocating on events in Charlottesville, attacks on
 the media and political opponents, and failure to respect democratic 
values and institutions that do not overtly support him — indicate that 
his retreat is not limited to his foreign policy. But these actions have
 foreign policy implications too. As we have seen before, when the 
United States does not honor its values in practice, other countries 
will use the American example to justify their abusive actions. This 
loss in moral authority and leadership will have wider implications for 
broader U.S. foreign policy and the development of democratic 
institutions globally.</p>
<p>Ray Tanter</p>
<p>The good. Trump has made some progress in confronting nuclear 
proliferation. He rightly sees the Iran nuclear deal as a bad one and 
has rattled North Korea. Consider the president’s <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4682768/president-donald-trump-full-speech-united-nations-general-assembly">speech</a> at the U.N. in September, his Iran strategy <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/10/13/remarks-president-trump-iran-strategy">speech</a> in Washington in October, and Newt Gingrich’s analysis of the situation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=42&amp;v=1dE_Mm-iKUc">here</a>. Trump’s Iran address concerned refraining from recertifying the country’s compliance with terms of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33521655">nuclear deal</a>. He didn’t break out of the agreement but communicated that it was not viable.</p>
<p>The bad. Neither the Iranian nor the North Korean proliferation 
problem is solved, and both may be worse than feared, because the 
countries can collude with each other. One way Iran could potentially 
get around the deal and achieve a nuclear breakout, or “<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/03/11/iran-nuclear-netanyahu-obama/">sneakout</a>,” is by purchasing weapons from Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Dov Zakheim</p>
<p>The good. Trump demonstrated that, unlike the previous president, he 
will not hesitate to respond militarily to Assad’s brutal employment of 
chemical weapons. He restored relationships with the Israelis, the 
Saudis, and other Gulf states — other than Qatar — that Obama had 
frittered away and that could still result in a new peace initiative, 
the announcement about moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem 
notwithstanding. Finally, he reversed himself on Afghanistan, committing
 a small but non-trivial number of additional troops to that troubled 
theater.</p>
<p>Do these positive actions offset his personal and policy liabilities?
 Most certainly not. But one must be grateful for small miracles.</p>
<p>The bad. Trump’s inability to control his impulses and his Twitter 
finger. His tweets have frightened allies, puzzled partners, complicated
 an already unstable security balance in northeast Asia, emboldened the 
Chinese in the South China Sea, and upended an international trading 
system that worked to America’s favor. All of this pales before his 
inflammatory pronouncements, which have threatened freedom of the press,
 sought to undermine the special counsel’s investigation — and, in the 
cases of his stance on Muslim and Latino immigration, his reaction to 
events in Charlottesville, and his support for the senatorial candidacy 
of Roy Moore, have divided an already uneasy nation and have diminished 
America’s moral standing in the world.</p>
