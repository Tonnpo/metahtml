<h2 class="rm-manual">After the Singapore summit, it isn't just wrong to say the North Korean leader is irrational — it's dangerous.</h2>

<p> North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un reacts at a signing ceremony with 
US President Donald Trump during their historic US-North Korea summit, 
at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island in Singapore on June 12, 2018. 
(SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) </p>
<p>The Singapore summit was long on theater and largely devoid of substance, save for a typical Trumpian <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/opinion/trump-foreign-policy-giveaway.html">giveaway</a>.
 This time Donald Trump impulsively offered to suspend military 
exercises with South Korea (without notifying Seoul in advance) in 
exchange for a North Korean pledge to do … well, nothing. If the 
self-proclaimed <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/01/donald-trump-deals-negotiation-art-of-deal-218584">master negotiator</a> keeps making deals like this, there will be a Kim Jong Un Hilton in Honolulu before there’s a Trump Tower in Pyongyang.</p>
<p>The most significant development in Singapore was to complete the 
transformation of Kim himself from a secretive, slightly comical, 
definitely murderous, and possibly irrational leader of a “Hermit 
Kingdom” into a serious and engaged world leader of some stature. The 
New York Times captured this notion perfectly in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/world/asia/kim-korea-image.html">article</a> published days before the summit, headlined “Kim Jong-un’s Image Shift: From Nuclear Madman to Skillful Leader.”</p>
<p>In fact, the Times’ story tells you less about Kim than it does about
 America’s self-defeating tendency to portray adversaries as irrational,
 crazy, deluded, risk-seeking, suicidal, or just plain nuts. Instead of 
seeing foreign-policy disputes as the product of straightforward 
conflicts of interest or clashing political values, even well- 
experienced U.S. officials and knowledgeable pundits are prone to seeing
 them as a reflection of personality defects, paranoia, or distorted 
views of reality. In truth, the Kim family has never been crazy or 
irrational; on the contrary, they’ve just managed to keep themselves in 
power in difficult circumstances for seven decades.</p>
<p>This tendency to see opponents as crazy has a long history. Americans
 saw Bolshevik leaders as irrational fanatics, and Secretary of State 
Edward Lansing calling Bolshevik ideology the “most hideous and 
monstrous thing that the human mind has ever conceived.” During the 
1960s, Secretary of State Dean Rusk described Beijing’s “state of mind 
[as] a combination of aggressive arrogance and obsessions of its own 
making,” and said that “a country whose behavior is as violent, 
irascible, unyielding, and hostile as that of Communist China is led by 
leaders who view of the world and of life itself is unreal.” In the 
1970s and 80s, other hard-liners suggested Soviet leaders placed so 
little value on human life that the ability of destroy all of the Soviet
 Union’s major cities and industrial centers and to kill tens of 
millions of Soviet citizens might not be enough to deter them from 
trying to “<a href="https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/why-the-soviet-union-thinks-it-could-fight-win-a-nuclear-war/">fight and win</a>” a nuclear war.</p>
<p>More recently, U.S. pundits justified attacking Iraq by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Threatening-Storm-Case-Invading-Iraq/dp/0375509283">claiming</a>
 that Saddam Hussein was an irrational, serial aggressor who could not 
be deterred, and advocates of war with Iran have said similar things 
about the clerical regime in Tehran. Former CIA director James Woolsey 
once described Iran’s leaders as “<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/woolsey-iran-and-obamas-choice-robert-costa">genocidal maniacs</a>,” and New York Times columnist Bret Stephens (then at the Wall Street Journal) justified preventive war by <a href="https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/iran-cannot-be-contained/">describing</a> Iran as a “martyrdom obsessed, non-Western culture.” Not to be outdone, Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute <a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/can-a-nuclear-iran-be-contained-or-deterred">suggested</a>
 its leaders were not deterrable because they might “believe Islamic 
interests make Iran’s weathering a retaliatory nuclear strike 
worthwhile.” Got that? The ayatollah won’t mind dying and having the 
country destroyed in a nuclear attack if it helps him spread Islam.</p>
<p>Similarly, many Americans continue to view international terrorists 
as deeply disturbed, irrational, deluded, or simply crazy individuals, 
instead of seeing them as politically motivated, calculating, and more 
or less rational actors who have adopted a particular tactic (sometimes 
including the use of suicide bombers) because they believe (with some 
basis) that it offers the best chance of realizing their political aims.
 Some of the individual attackers may indeed by driven by wholly 
fictitious beliefs, but to dismiss these groups and their leaders as 
simply crazy underestimates their own resilience, strategic behavior, 
and capacity to adapt.</p>
<p>In a certain sense, it is not surprising that even well-informed 
Americans are inclined to think this way. Convinced that their own 
country is uniquely virtuous, exceptional, wise, and selfless, and that 
U.S. foreign policy is good for nearly everyone, it is easy for them 
believe that those who disagree with U.S. policy and question America’s 
motives must be suffering from some sort of mental disorder. If 
opponents were sane and rational and well informed, they would surely 
recognize the nobility of our aims and would leap to support our 
initiatives. President George W. Bush captured this perspective 
perfectly when he admitted after 9/11 that he was “amazed that people 
would hate us … because I know how good we are.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this tendency to treat foes as inherently irrational 
has real costs. For starters, if an enemy is truly irrational or crazy, 
then this implies that they will not be intimidated by America’s obvious
 military superiority and the usual strategies of deterrence may not 
work. If that is the case, then preventive war becomes a more attractive
 option. As noted above, this is precisely what happened in the case of 
Iraq and has been a key part of the hawks’ recipe for military action 
against Iran. Those who have favored military strikes against North 
Korea — including National Security Advisor John Bolton — have made <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/02/24/bolton-use-of-nerve-gas-proves-north-korea-is-crazy-irrational-and-dangerous">similar arguments</a> about Kim (before the latter’s recent transformation from “madman” to “statesman”).</p>
<p>Second, attributing an adversary’s behavior to various forms of 
irrationality can blind us to the real reasons behind their behavior. 
Americans sometimes view the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction by 
states like North Korea, Iran, or Libya as some sort of wild aberration,
 or as evidence of deeply malign intent. In this view, it is simply 
crazy for a poor country like North Korea to devote vast resources to 
developing nuclear weapons, and it just shows you how bizarre, paranoid,
 and dangerous the Kim family is. But all of these states had legitimate
 reason to worry about foreign attack, and therefore some basis for 
wanting a reliable deterrent. (And if the mighty United States thinks it
 needs thousands of nukes to be safe, it is not hard to see why these 
far weaker states might see them as a useful insurance policy.) 
Moreover, as Kim has just proven (again!), having an actual working 
nuclear bomb turns out to be a pretty good way of getting Washington’s 
attention and even a certain degree of respect.</p>
<p>Third, if an opponent is crazy, irrational, or wildly misinformed, 
one cannot expect them to respond sensibly to carrots, sticks, or 
reasoned arguments. The belief that the other side is unreasonable, or 
even worse, incapable of reason, makes normal diplomacy seem like a 
waste of time. What’s the point of talking to a crazy person or a crazy 
regime? Exaggerating an enemy’s irrationality thus makes it more likely 
that potential positive diplomatic deals won’t even be contemplated, let
 alone attempted.</p>
<p>And while we’re talking about perceived irrational behavior, 
Americans might want to be a bit more self-reflective. We like to 
portray our enemies as irrational and foolhardy, but we’ve been guilty 
of no small amount of crazy behavior ourselves. Reasonable people can 
disagree about the net costs and benefits of NATO expansion, for 
example, but it was pretty crazy to think the United States could keep 
moving NATO eastward without severely damaging relations with Moscow. 
Yet proponents kept insisting that Moscow wouldn’t object, or that its 
objections were insincere or ill-founded. It was positively delusional 
for Americans to think that invading Iraq would quickly produce a 
stable, prosperous, pro-American democracy, and ignite a broad process 
of democratization throughout the region, but a lot of smart people 
bought that line back in 2002 and 2003. It was equally foolish to think 
that toppling Muammar al-Qaddafi or demanding “Assad must go” would have
 salutary effects in either Libya or Syria, yet top officials convinced 
themselves that this was in fact the case. And if the definition of 
insanity is doing the same thing over and over yet expecting a different
 result, what does U.S. policy in Afghanistan tell you about the 
“rationality” of our political and military leaders?</p>
<p>Lastly but by no means least, what are other states to make of a 
president who can’t get through a day without telling a bald-faced lie (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/politics/donald-trump-3000/index.html">or several</a>),
 insults the leaders of our closest allies not just once but repeatedly,
 and who changes course so frequently that neither friends nor foes can 
be confident that an agreement reached today will be abided tomorrow. 
Unlike <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250179456">some of his critics,</a> I don’t think President Trump is crazy or in the early stages of dementia (although reading the clinical description of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662">narcissistic personality disorder</a>
 is more than a little worrisome). But based on his performance thus 
far, it’s easy to see why major world leaders might conclude that there 
was no point in trying to accommodate, mollify, appeal to, or compromise
 with a leader as capricious and vindictive as Trump. Kim Jong Un seems 
to have demonstrated that one gets more respect from Trump by defying 
him than be trying to get along. If other leaders reach the same 
conclusion, they will devote less effort to remaining on good terms with
 the United States and concentrate instead on building cooperative 
arrangements with each other.</p>
<p>At this point, they’d be crazy not to.</p>
