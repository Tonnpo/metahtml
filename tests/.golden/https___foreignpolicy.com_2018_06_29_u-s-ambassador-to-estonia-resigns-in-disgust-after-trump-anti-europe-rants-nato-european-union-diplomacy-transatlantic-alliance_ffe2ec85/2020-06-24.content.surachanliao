<p><span>The U.S. ambassador to Estonia, James D. Melville Jr., a career
 diplomat and member of the senior foreign service ranks, announced to 
friends Friday that he was resigning amid a string of controversial 
comments President Donald Trump made about U.S. allies in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span>Melville, who has served as a diplomat for 33 years and as 
ambassador to Estonia since 2015, was due to retire soon but said in a 
private Facebook post announcing his retirement that Trump’s behavior 
and comments accelerated his decision. </span></p>
<p><span>“A Foreign Service Officer’s DNA is programmed to support 
policy and we’re schooled right from the start, that if there ever comes
 a point where one can no longer do so, particularly if one is in a 
position of leadership, the honorable course is to resign. Having served
 under six presidents and 11 secretaries of state, I never really 
thought it would reach that point for me,” he wrote in the post, which 
was obtained by <span>Foreign Policy</span>. </span></p>
<p><span>“For the President to say the EU was ‘set up to take advantage 
of the United States, to attack our piggy bank,’ or that ‘NATO is as bad
 as NAFTA’ is not only factually wrong, but proves to me that it’s time 
to go,” he wrote, citing Trump’s reported comments in recent weeks that 
have unnerved U.S. allies.</span></p>
<p><span>The post surprised several State Department officials who 
worked with Melville, describing him as a consummate professional who 
never let domestic politics impact his job. </span></p>
<p><span>The resignation comes ahead of a pivotal NATO summit, where the
 United States’ closest historic allies fear that Trump will lambast 
them and further isolate Washington from its allies after heated 
disputes over trade, defense spending issues, and the U.S. exit from the
 Iran nuclear deal. Allies fear that the optics of Trump trashing allies
 in Brussels, followed by a meeting in Finland with Russian President 
Vladimir Putin, will undercut an already anemic trans-Atlantic 
partnership.</span></p>
<p>[<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/06/27/ahead-of-nato-summit-u-s-president-exhorts-allies-to-pay-up-transatlantic-alliance-trump-brussels-summit-letter-to-allies-burden-sharing-two-percent-defense-spending/">NATO
 is bracing for impact with Trump’s upcoming visit to Brussels — and 
Trump isn’t backing down from the fight over European defense spending.</a>]</p>
<p><span>Melville said he believed in the U.S. support for the European Union and NATO to his “marrow.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I leave willingly and with deep gratitude for being able to 
serve my nation with integrity for many years, and with great confidence
 that America, which is and has always been, great, will someday return 
to being right,” he added. He said his last day on the job would be July
 29, even though the Trump administration has yet to name a replacement.
 (Trump last month quietly withdrew the name of Edward Masso to be 
ambassador, though did not explain why.)</span></p>
<p>The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><span>Melville is one of many senior U.S. diplomats who have resigned
 — some quietly, some not — because of Trump’s policies. In December 
2017, for example, the U.S. ambassador to Panama, John Feeley, resigned 
and several months later wrote an </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-i-could-no-longer-serve-this-president/2018/03/08/f444f086-225c-11e8-86f6-54bfff693d2b_story.html?utm_term=.39c4bf8831aa"><span>op-ed</span></a><span>
 for the Washington Post slamming the president and his foreign-policy 
stances. Elizabeth Shackelford, a rising star in the diplomatic corps in
 Africa, quit with a </span><span>scathing resignation letter</span><span>, also obtained by <span>FP</span>, deriding Trump and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for what she saw as their disdain of U.S. diplomacy.</span></p>
<p>[<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/09/u-s-diplomat-resigns-warning-of-state-departments-diminished-role-diplomacy-national-security-tillerson-africa-somalia-south-sudan/">One diplomat’s stinging resignation letter offers a glimpse into declining morale at the State Department under Trump.</a>]</p>
<p><span>“It means a lot when someone whose had it all in their career 
just says, ‘I can’t do this any longer,’” one senior State Department 
official said of Melville’s retirement. “I just wonder who’s next.”</span></p>
