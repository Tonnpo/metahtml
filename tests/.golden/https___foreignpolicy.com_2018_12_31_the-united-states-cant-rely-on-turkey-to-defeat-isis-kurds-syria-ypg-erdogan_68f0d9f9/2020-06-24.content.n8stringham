<p>President Donald Trump’s plan to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria 
means that the United States is relying on Turkey to shoulder the burden
 of countering the Islamic State. This move will provide the terrorist 
group with an opportunity to revive itself at a critical stage in the 
fight.</p>
<p>Trump claims exiting Syria has been his plan all along. Still, many 
U.S. policymakers, including those in Congress, were caught by 
surprise—especially given the September assertion by Trump’s national 
security advisor, John Bolton, that U.S. troops would remain in Syria 
until the Iranians left.</p>
<p>When Trump announced his surprising about-face on what had been the 
closest thing Washington had to a Syria policy—the presence of 2,000 or 
so U.S. troops and support for Kurdish militia forces—he did so after a 
conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Shortly after 
the phone call, Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1076515352249597954">tweeted</a>,
 “Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including 
Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains.” He went
 on to <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1077064829825966081">add</a> that the Turkish leader “has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of ISIS in Syria.”</p>
<p>Apart from taking Turkish talking points at face value, there is a fundamental problem with this calculation. <span>Ankara has often demonstrated a <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/12/turkeys-double-isis-standard/">reluctance</a>
 to take on the Islamic State directly, preferring instead to focus its 
energy and resources on countering the Kurds and Erdogan’s opposition.</span>
 For years, Turkey has been playing a double game. Erdogan’s main 
objective is to prevent Syrian Kurds from consolidating more territory 
and establishing a corridor parallel to the southern Turkish border. 
Eradicating the Islamic State’s presence in Syria—and its networks 
within Turkey—is a secondary priority that has often been ignored 
entirely.</p>
<p>Yet, because the Islamic State has already established a <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/02/15/erdogans-fatal-blind-spot/">nascent infrastructure</a>
 in Turkey, the recent policy decision to withdraw from Syria could 
breathe new life into the group, endangering Turkish soldiers and 
civilians at home and allowing the group to make a comeback in Syria.</p>
<p>Turkey’s borders remain far from impenetrable, and the Islamic 
State’s leaders recognize the importance of a robust logistics 
capability. Syria is the conflict zone that provides the Islamic State 
with operational space, but Turkey—with modern communications, 
transportation, and links to the global economy—is close to an ideal 
country for a terrorist group to take advantage of, akin to a rear 
supply base or logistical hub. Its security and intelligence services 
possess finite resources, which remain primarily geared toward fighting 
the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a group Turkey knows well and has 
been combating for nearly four decades.</p>
<p>One of Erdogan’s main arguments, and a point of contention between 
Ankara and Washington since the beginning of U.S. involvement in Syria, 
is that the People’s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia and the 
most effective fighting force in the broader anti-Islamic State 
coalition, is an extension of the PKK. Since the United States was 
backing the YPG as the main element of the Syrian Democratic Forces 
(SDF), the argument goes, it was essentially sponsoring terrorism. This 
message resonates with Erdogan’s supporters, but because the YPG was the
 most effective bulwark against the Islamic State, the United States is 
far less sympathetic to this characterization.</p>
<p>Relying heavily on Erdogan <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/28/turkey-is-lying-about-fighting-isis/">presents a problem</a>
 regarding both capability and intent across two dimensions: fighting 
the Islamic State on the battlefield in Syria and stamping out Islamic 
State networks and small cells of militants already entrenched in 
Turkey. Following high-profile attacks in Ankara, Istanbul, and 
Gaziantep over the past several years, the Islamic State has 
demonstrated its reach and operational capability.</p>
<p>In terms of fighting the Islamic State in Syria, Turkey boasts a 
formidable military—on paper, at least. But even with the Islamic State 
cornered in small towns and villages along the central Euphrates River 
valley, the United States was unable to completely eradicate the 
remnants of the group. So why does Trump think the Turks will be able to
 achieve this objective? The U.S. withdrawal comes amid a flurry of 
reports that the Islamic State is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/retreating-isis-army-smuggled-a-fortune-in-cash-and-gold-out-of-iraq-and-syria/2018/12/21/95087ffc-054b-11e9-9122-82e98f91ee6f_story.html?utm_term=.39b692652e82">hunkering down</a> for a long fight and preparing to wage a guerilla insurgency in the Sunni heartland of eastern Syria.</p>
<p><span>It will be especially difficult to fight the Islamic State at a
 time when the leadership of the Turkish security forces has been 
gutted.</span> In late 2013, Turkey launched an anti-corruption probe, 
which was accelerated following a coup attempt in July 2016. The 
instability has led to command-and-control issues and fissures among 
pockets of military and intelligence leadership. The Turkish government 
purged hundreds of thousands of public servants across the country, 
including police, military officers, prosecutors, and judges. As a 
result, the state was left with an inexperienced and poorly trained 
counterterrorism and intelligence staff that is often plagued by serious
 operational flaws and prone to human right abuses.</p>
<p>Instead of taking a more comprehensive approach, Erdogan’s security 
policy has been one of either/or, with respect to fighting the Kurds and
 the Islamic State. The political will on the part of the Turkish 
government to wholeheartedly confront the Islamic State has been 
conspicuously lacking, which is somewhat vexing given operations 
launched by the Islamic State on Turkish soil. These include major 
attacks like the June 2016 Ataturk Airport incident in Istanbul or the 
assault on the <a href="https://ctc.usma.edu/the-reina-nightclub-attack-and-the-islamic-state-threat-to-turkey/">Reina nightclub</a>
 in January 2017. Ostensibly, Turkey should have a vested interest in 
uprooting a terrorist group from its territory. But in the Middle East, 
the enemy of one’s enemy is still too often seen as a friend, so the 
Islamic State was viewed as a source of “strategic depth” against the 
Kurds, similar to the manner in which Pakistan’s Inter-Services 
Intelligence and military rely on the Taliban, despite attacks that have
 been directed against Pakistani personnel. This is merely viewed as the
 cost of doing business in a dangerous region.</p>
<p>There may also be a sectarian angle at work, as the Islamic State was
 fighting the Bashar al-Assad regime, a symbol of Shiite Islam, while 
Erdogan has worked assiduously to bolster his image as the most prolific
 defender of Sunni Islam in the region. Alliances are already shifting, 
with the YPG <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/world/middleeast/syria-kurds-turkey-manbij.html">recently asking</a> the Assad regime to deploy troops to Manbij, near the Turkish border. Some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/us/politics/lindsey-graham-syria-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">U.S. policymakers</a>
 recognize how detrimental a growing relationship between Assad and the 
Kurds would be and have scrambled to persuade Trump to slow or even walk
 back aspects of the planned withdrawal.</p>
<p>The consequences of fighting the Kurds and ignoring the Islamic State
 could be doubly damaging for Turks at home. If Erdogan follows through 
on attacking the Kurds in northern Syria, it will keep Turkey’s military
 occupied in that theater and could prompt retaliation by Kurdish 
militants in Turkey proper.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, Kurdish terrorist groups have demonstrated the 
ability to strike deep into the heart of Turkey—and with devastating 
effect. In the summer of 2015, Kurdish militants killed a Turkish 
soldier and wounded several others in Adiyaman, while two police 
officers were gunned down in Ceylanpinar. So, with forces deployed in 
conventional military combat in another country and ongoing 
counterterrorism investigations and operations against Kurdish 
terrorists internally, it is highly doubtful that Erdogan can deliver on
 his promise to Trump to wipe out what remains of the Islamic State in 
Syria.</p>
<p><span>If Islamic State militants are allowed to rebuild their networks in Turkey, the implications are dire.</span>
 The Islamic State will be able to use Turkey for logistical support, 
thus fueling its insurgency across the border in Syria. Rogue elements 
could also launch attacks in Turkey, while other cells might seek to 
plot attacks in Europe.</p>
<p>Turkey was never completely sincere in its fight against the Islamic 
State, often sending conflicting messages to friends and foes alike. 
Between 8,000 to 10,000 Turks have moved to Syria and Iraq as foreign 
terrorist fighters since the beginning of the conflict. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-politics-survey-islamic-state-idUSL8N14W3PN20160112">Turkey’s Social Trends Survey</a>
 carried out among 1,500 people across Turkey in 2015, about 9 percent 
of Turks said they believed the Islamic State was not a terrorist 
organization, and more than 5 percent said they supported its actions.</p>
<p>Turkey is scheduled to hold local elections March 31, 2019. Erdogan 
has expressed concern about the outcome of these elections amid the 
economic crisis Turkey has been suffering from. The fight against the 
PKK has often been a great domestic tool for Erdogan to mobilize the 
nationalist voter base in Turkey, and his Justice and Development Party 
has aligned itself with the Nationalist Movement Party for the March 
elections. Domestic politics were believed to be a major justification 
for Erdogan’s rationale when he announced in mid-December—two weeks 
before his phone call with Trump—that Turkey was going to start the 
operation against the SDF.</p>
<p>It is difficult to see how Turkey can fight the Islamic State 
effectively now. The majority of the remaining pockets of the Islamic 
State territory are over 300 miles away from Turkey’s border. 
Accordingly, it is almost impossible for the Turkish army and its local 
allies to reach these areas to effectively fight against the Islamic 
State and exert full control over this territory.</p>
<p>Erdogan relies on the Free Syrian Army (FSA)—a group of Syrian Arab 
military officers who formerly served under Syrian President Bashar 
al-Assad—in the territories he is holding. He may be planning to deploy 
the FSA during his promised offensive against the SDF, but there are a 
host of complicated issues to consider. First, it is an ill-disciplined 
force, and there are reports about the atrocities of these forces paid 
and backed by Turkey. Following an operation by Turkish-backed Syrian 
rebels in Afrin in March, there were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43457214">widespread reports</a> of looting and theft of locals’ property.</p>
<p>More worrying is the potential overlap between the Islamic State and 
the FSA. It is well known that some returning Islamic State fighters 
joined the FSA and ascended to leadership positions. For example, <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/fsa-commander-criticizes-france-s-links-with-ypg-pkk/1347736">Seyf Ebu Bekir</a>, a commander of the Hamza Division of the FSA, is a former <a href="http://demokrasi78.com/2016/09/17/oso-postunda-isid/">Islamic State</a> member from Bab. <span>Many Islamic State fighters are now serving in the Turkish-backed militia as commanders.</span></p>
<p>Given all these factors, it’s clear that Erdogan is not entirely 
sincere in his promise to fight back against the Islamic State. Rather, 
with the Turkish president focused on helping his party gain more power 
in upcoming local elections, his promise to Trump to wipe out the 
Islamic State is merely a useful domestic tool to help him boost his 
popularity as a capable leader and military commander.</p>
<p>Trump’s gamble can pay off, but only if Erdogan follows through on 
his promise to destroy the Islamic State, a pledge that history 
indicates Turkey’s president would be unwilling to keep, no matter how 
much Washington wants to expedite its plans to extricate the United 
States from the quagmire of the Syrian civil war.</p>
