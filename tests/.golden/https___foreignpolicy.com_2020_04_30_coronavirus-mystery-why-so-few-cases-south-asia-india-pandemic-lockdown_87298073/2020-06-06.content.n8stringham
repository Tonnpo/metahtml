 a quarter of the world’s population but account for only 2 percent of

<p>Welcome to Foreign Policy’s weekly South Asia Brief. Today, we 
attempt to explain why there are so few coronavirus cases across the 
region. Plus: Another deadly attack rocks Afghanistan, a constitutional 
crisis brews in Sri Lanka, and the death of two Bollywood legends.</p>
<p>If you would like to receive South Asia Brief in your inbox every Thursday, please sign up <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/newsletters">here</a>.</p>
<p>Why Aren’t There More Coronavirus Cases in South Asia?</p>
<p>Let’s face it: Everyone expected worse. More than three months after 
the first recorded case of the coronavirus in South Asia, the region has
 only around 60,000 confirmed infections. By comparison, the United 
States has more than 1 million, while Spain and Italy both have 
confirmed more than 200,000. Put another way, South Asia’s countries 
account for one-quarter of the world’s population but only 2 percent of 
its coronavirus infections. Why?</p>
<p>Parsing the numbers. South Asia’s relatively low case numbers are a 
bit of a puzzle, especially given high population density and poor 
health care systems across the region. An immediate reaction is to call 
into question its testing capacity. India has so far <a href="https://www.icmr.gov.in/">conducted</a>
 only 830,201 tests, or 614 for every 1 million people—among the lowest 
rates of testing in the world. But if India’s low rate of testing were 
hiding a massive outbreak, it would show up in other ways. Only 4 
percent of India’s coronavirus tests have returned <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/28/india/india-coronavirus-outbreak-explained-intl-hnk/index.html">positive</a>, compared with around 17 percent in the United States, implying that the virus is less widespread in India.</p>
<p>Another indicator of a larger outbreak would be the number of deaths.
 But here the data also shows South Asia in a favorable light. While the
 United States has <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/04/mapping-coronavirus-outbreak-infographic/">recorded</a>
 more than 60,000 deaths from COVID-19, India counts only 1,079 so far. 
Those numbers are likely higher—only one-fifth of deaths in India tend 
to be medically certified—but it is not as if there has been a massive 
surge in hospital admissions.</p>
<p>Using India’s data as a proxy for the region, the likely takeaway 
would be that South Asian countries have either succeeded in flattening 
their curves for now or that they are still in the early stages of their
 outbreaks. If it’s the latter, then the current state of lockdown 
ensures the coronavirus won’t spread too rapidly.</p>
<p>Successful approach? Has South Asia succeeded where Western countries
 have failed? Countries such as India and Bangladesh have imposed 
stricter lockdowns than the West—and earlier in their respective 
outbreaks. In that sense, South Asian economies should be commended for 
moving quickly in response to the shutdowns in other countries. With the
 exception of Pakistan, which for a while allowed flights to China, most
 of the region’s countries imposed strict restrictions on international 
and domestic travel.</p>
<p>Even that doesn’t completely explain the low number of cases. After 
all, even after closing the borders, the number of cases rose 
internally. And many South Asian countries made vital errors. India 
announced its nationwide lockdown with no prior notice, leaving millions
 of migrant workers displaced and vulnerable. Across the region, 
gatherings of religious groups took place in early March, leading to 
coronavirus clusters.</p>
<p>To their credit, authorities seem to have had some success in contact
 tracing and imposing quarantines. One theory goes that the region’s 
youthful demographics give it an advantage. India, for example, has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_median_age">median age</a>
 of 28, compared with 38 in the United States. (The median ages in 
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan are 18, 26, and 24, respectively.)
 But even here, if there are many asymptomatic cases among young people,
 then those may eventually show up in infections among elderly 
populations—and that has yet to be recorded.</p>
<p>Other theories are more tenuous. For example, the World Health Organization says there is <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/bacille-calmette-gu%C3%A9rin-(bcg)-vaccination-and-covid-19">no evidence</a>
 that the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine—widely deployed in South Asia
 to fight tuberculosis—provides protection from the coronavirus. Nor is 
there proof that warmer weather slows the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Summer strategy. There is no real end to the pandemic unless the 
world can develop a vaccine. That means it’s too soon to declare any 
country’s approach a success. And there lies the real problem for South 
Asia. Countries are already easing some of their early restrictions. 
India’s government has <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/govt-eases-lockdown-rules-allows-all-local-and-standalone-shops-to-open-120042500051_1.html">allowed</a>
 the opening of neighborhood shops, as well as some work in 
construction, agriculture, and manufacturing. Pakistan has allowed 
mosques to open for Ramadan prayers. Bangladesh is reopening some of its
 garment factories, a vital part of its economy. These reversals could 
lead to spikes in rates of infections.</p>
<p>Lawmakers will have to weigh the dangers of further outbreaks against
 a growing restlessness among their populations. In Surat, India, a 
crowd of migrant workers <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hundreds-of-migrant-workers-protest-in-surat-for-third-time-in-less-than-a-month/article31453039.ece">turned violent</a>,
 throwing stones at glass windows at a construction site and damaging 
vehicles. They want to work or go home to their villages, and something 
has to give. But there are no perfect choices.</p>
<p>What We’re Following</p>
<p>Sri Lanka’s constitutional crisis. Sri Lanka’s opposition <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/sri-lanka-faces-cash-crunch-without-parliament-amid-102541374.html">says</a>
 state spending will become illegal beginning on Friday unless the 
government urgently recalls Parliament. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa 
used his constitutional powers to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/sri-lankan-parliament-dissolved-elections-set-april-200302193858515.html">dissolve</a>
 Parliament last month in a bid to call for elections six months ahead 
of schedule. Before he did so, legislators voted to allow spending by 
the state until April 30. Given the national lockdown, however, it is 
now unclear when Sri Lanka will be able to conduct a viable national 
vote.</p>
<p>Suicide bombing in Afghanistan. Despite the ongoing U.S.-led peace talks and the start of the holy month of Ramadan, a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-attacks/bombing-near-afghan-capital-kills-three-amid-unabated-violence-idUSKCN22B0HD">suicide bombing</a>
 near Kabul on Wednesday killed three people and wounded at least a 
dozen others. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. The 
bombing took place the day after a Taliban attack on checkpoints in 
Semangan province that killed nine Afghan security officials. Meanwhile,
 as Stefanie Glinski <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/28/afghanistan-coronavirus-lockdown-starvation-war/">reports</a> for Foreign Policy, the coronavirus lockdown presents most Afghans with an impossible choice: get sick or go hungry.</p>
<p>Religious freedom in India. A top religious freedom watchdog is urging the U.S. State Department to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/04/28/us/ap-rel-global-religious-freedom.html">designate</a>
 India as a “country of particular concern.” In its annual report, the 
bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom called 
India’s treatment of religious minorities “troublesome.” An Indian 
government spokesperson called the report “biased and tendentious.” But 
criticism of India is now quite widespread: Several Gulf states have 
expressed outrage over hateful social media posts, as Al Jazeera <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/arabs-speaking-islamophobia-india-200423112102197.html">reports</a>.</p>
<p>Question of the Week</p>
<p>As if the coronavirus pandemic were not enough, Indian officials 
report that farms across the region face a new threat this summer that 
could endanger food security. What is the threat?</p>
<p>A) Locusts</p>
<p> B) Too little rainfall</p>
<p> C) Too much rainfall</p>
<p> D) Labor shortages</p>
<p>Scroll down for the answer. </p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>Irrfan Khan attends a photocall during the annual Dubai International
 Film Festival on Dec. 8, 2017 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. </p>
<p>Bollywood deaths. In 24 hours, Bollywood lost two major stars—but 
neither to COVID-19. Irrfan Khan, renowned for his roles in Life of Pi, 
Slumdog Millionaire, The Lunchbox, and several Bollywood hits, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-india-52468343">died</a> at 53 in Mumbai on Tuesday of infections related to a rare cancer. Just a few hours later, the actor Rishi Kapoor <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/rishi-kapoor-death-intl-hnk/index.html">succumbed</a> to leukemia, also in Mumbai. Kapoor, the star of films such as Bobby (1973) and Om Shanti Om (1980), was 67.</p>
<p>And the Answer Is…</p>
<p>A) Locusts.</p>
<p>A giant locust storm from the Horn of Africa could be <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/after-covid-19-indias-next-challenge-could-be-mega-sized-locust-attack-this-summer/article31429925.ece">headed</a>
 toward South Asia this summer, according to the Hindu. The locusts 
could travel over a land corridor from Iran or pass over the Indian 
Ocean and attack farms in peninsular India. Locusts can consume an 
alarming amount of food: A one square kilometer swarm can eat as much 
food in one day as 35,000 people.</p>
<p>That’s it for this week.</p>
