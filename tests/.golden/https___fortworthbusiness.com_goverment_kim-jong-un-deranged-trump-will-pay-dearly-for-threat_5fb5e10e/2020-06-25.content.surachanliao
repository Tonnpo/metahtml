<p class="rm-manual"><span>By </span> <a href="https://fortworthbusiness.com/author/foster-klug-associated-press/">FOSTER KLUG Associated Press</a></p>

<p class="rm-manual">Kim Jong Un: Trump will "pay dearly." (Photo by Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP)</p>
<p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in an 
extraordinary and direct rebuke, called President Donald Trump 
“deranged” and said he will “pay dearly” for his threats, a possible 
indication of more powerful weapons tests on the horizon.</p>
<p>Hours later, North Korea’s foreign minister reportedly said that his 
country may be planning to test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean to 
fulfill Kim’s vow to take the “highest-level” action against the United 
States.</p>
<p>Kim, in his statement, said Trump is “unfit to hold the prerogative 
of supreme command of a country.” He also described the U.S. president 
as “a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire.”</p>
<p>The dispatch was unusual in that it was written in the first person, 
albeit filtered through the North’s state media, which are part of 
propaganda efforts meant to glorify Kim. South Korea’s government said 
it was the first such direct address to the world by any North Korean 
leader.</p>
<p>Some analysts saw a clear sign that North Korea would ramp up its 
already brisk pace of weapons testing, which has included missiles meant
 to target U.S. forces throughout Asia and the U.S. mainland.</p>
<p>“I will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command 
in the U.S. pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying the
 DPRK,” said the statement carried by North’s official Korean Central 
News Agency on Friday morning.</p>
<p>DPRK is the abbreviation of the country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told reporters on the 
sidelines of a United Nations gathering that his country’s response 
“could be the most powerful detonation of an H-bomb in the Pacific,” 
according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency.</p>
<p>Ri reportedly added that “We have no idea about what actions could be taken as it will be ordered by leader Kim Jong Un.”</p>
<p>Such a test would be considered a major provocation by Washington and its allies.</p>
<p>The statement by Kim Jong Un responded to Trump’s combative speech at
 the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday where he mocked Kim as a “Rocket 
Man” on a “suicide mission,” and said that if “forced to defend itself 
or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North 
Korea.”</p>
<p>Kim characterized Trump’s speech to the world body as “unprecedented rude nonsense.”</p>
<p>He said Trump’s remarks “have convinced me, rather than frightening 
or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I
 have to follow to the last.”</p>
<p>Kim said he is “thinking hard” about his response and that he would “tame the mentally deranged U. S. dotard with fire.”</p>
<p>Kim Dong-yub, a former South Korean military official who is now an 
analyst at Seoul’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said Kim Jong Un’s
 statement indicated that North Korea will respond to Trump with its 
most aggressive missile test yet. That might include firing a Hwasong-14
 intercontinental ballistic missile over Japan to a range of around 
7,000 kilometers (4,349 miles) to display a capability to reach Hawaii 
or Alaska.</p>
<p>The statement will further escalate the war of words between the 
adversaries as the North moves closer to perfecting a nuclear-tipped 
missile that could strike America.</p>
<p>In recent months, the North has launched a pair of 
still-developmental ICBMs it said were capable of striking the 
continental United States and a pair of intermediate-range missiles that
 soared over Japanese territory. Earlier this month, North Korea 
conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date drawing 
stiffer U.N. sanctions.</p>
<p>South Korea called Kim Jong Un’s rebuke a “reckless provocation” that
 would deepen his country’s international isolation and lead to its 
demise.</p>
<p>South Korea’s Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told 
reporters Friday that North Korea must immediately stop such 
provocations and return to talks on nuclear disarmament.</p>
