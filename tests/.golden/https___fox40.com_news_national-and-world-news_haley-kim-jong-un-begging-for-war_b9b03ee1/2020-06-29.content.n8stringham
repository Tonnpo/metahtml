<p>NEW YORK — US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said 
Monday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was “begging for war” as she
 urged the UN Security Council to adopt the strongest sanctions measures
 possible to stop Pyongyang’s nuclear program.</p>
<p>Speaking at a Security Council emergency meeting, Haley said North 
Korea’s sixth nuclear test was a clear sign that “the time for half 
measures” from the UN had to end.</p>
<p>“Enough is enough,” Haley said. “We have taken an incremental approach, and despite the best of intentions, it has not worked.”</p>
<p>Haley began her statement by ticking through all of the resolutions 
the Security Council has passed in response to North Korea’s 
provocations over the past two-plus decades, making the point that the 
UN has been united condemning Pyongyang but the efforts have not managed
 to stop its nuclear progress.</p>
<p>She said the US does not want war but will defend itself when North 
Korea is issuing threats with missiles pointed at US territories.</p>
<p>“War is never something the Unites States wants — we don’t want it 
now,” Haley said. “But our country’s patience is not unlimited. We will 
defend our allies and our territory.”</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the meeting, Haley said that the US would 
circulate a resolution in response to the nuclear test, with plans for a
 vote on it next week.</p>
<p>“I think that North Korea has basically slapped everyone in the face 
in the international community that has asked them to stop,” Haley said.</p>
<p>While details of a resolution weren’t discussed on Monday, South 
Korea’s Ambassador to the UN Cho Tae-yul said it had to be “truly 
biting.”</p>
<p>“Now is the time to take measures that are strong and robust enough 
to compel North Korea to seriously engage in dialogue,” he said. “The 
new resolution must include not only additional measures to further 
block funds that could possibly flow into North Korea’s illegal nuclear 
program, but also truly biting and robust measures that Pyongyang finds 
very painful.”</p>
<h3>South Korea’s response</h3>
<p>South Korea launched a major military show of force on Monday in response to the latest nuclear test from the North, including <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/04/asia/north-korea-nuclear-test/index.html" rel="noopener">live-fire drills</a> simulating an attack on Pyongyang’s nuclear testing site.</p>
<p>South Korea’s defense ministry said Monday the drills were intended 
to demonstrate Seoul’s willingness to “wipe out” the regime of Kim Jong 
Un, while South Korean defense officials also noted there were signs 
North Korea was preparing for another launch of an intercontinental 
ballistic missile (ICBM).</p>
<p>Seoul said that it would activate four Terminal High Altitude Area 
Defense (THAAD) launch pads, the US missile defense system intended to 
shoot down potential missiles shot from Pyongyang.</p>
<p>The THAAD deployment, however, has sparked criticisms from Russia and
 China, and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Monday 
that Moscow might increase its missile presence in the Pacific to 
respond to the THAAD deployment. Neither Russia nor China mentioned the 
missile defense deployment at the Security Council meeting, however.</p>
<h3>Leaders discussing next steps</h3>
<p>US President Donald Trump <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/04/politics/donald-trump-south-korea/index.html" rel="noopener">spoke by phone</a>
 Monday with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in a 40-minute phone 
call, according to Park Soo-hyun, a spokesman for South Korea’s 
presidential office. They discussed responses to North Korea’s nuclear 
test and agreed to lift restrictions on the payload weight of South 
Korea’s ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>The phone call came after Trump issued a tweet Sunday criticizing the
 new South Korean leader’s approach to North Korea. “South Korea is 
finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North 
Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!” Trump wrote.</p>
<p>The White House statement on the call noted the lifting of payload 
restrictions on South Korean missiles, as well as Trump providing his 
“conceptual approval for the purchase of many billions of dollars’ worth
 of military weapons and equipment from the United States by South 
Korea.”</p>
<p>The call was one of a number of conversations Monday between world leaders in the wake of North Korea’s nuclear test.</p>
<p>Moon also spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in 
which Seoul said the two leaders discussed cutting off Pyongyang’s crude
 oil supplies and sources for foreign currency.</p>
<p>And Trump also spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday. 
Merkel’s spokesman said the German leader confirmed to Trump that 
Germany would work with the European Union for new and stricter 
sanctions against North Korea.</p>
<h3>US, China tensions over Pyongyang</h3>
<p>Monday’s Security Council meeting was convened in response to North 
Korea’s latest nuclear test, but it’s the 10th time that the council has
 met on North Korea this year — and the second time in less than a week,
 according to Jeffrey Feltman, UN undersecretary for political affairs.</p>
<p>In addition to his appeasement tweet, Trump has said in recent days 
that “talking is not the answer,” and Defense Secretary James Mattis 
warned on Sunday of a “massive military response” to any threat from 
North Korea against the US or its allies.</p>
<p>But Trump has also targeted China as complicit in allowing North 
Korea’s nuclear program to march on. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the 
US was considering “stopping all trade with any country doing business 
with North Korea,” which would include China.</p>
<p>At the UN meeting Monday, Chinese Ambassador to the UN Liu Jieyi said
 the situation was “falling into a vicious circle” and urged North Korea
 to “stop taking actions that are wrong.”</p>
<p>“We strongly urge the DPRK to face up squarely to the firm will of 
the international community on the issue of the denuclearization of the 
peninsula and earnestly abide by the relevant resolutions of the 
council.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Liu cautioned against any military option.</p>
<p>“The peninsula issue must be resolved peacefully,” he said. “China will never allow chaos and war on the peninsula.”</p>
<p>Liu touted a proposal from China and Russia of a “suspension for 
suspension,” also known as “freeze for freeze,” where Pyongyang would 
freeze its nuclear program in exchange for the US and South Korea 
suspending joint military exercises.</p>
<p>But before he spoke, Haley called such a proposal “insulting.”</p>
<p>“The idea that some have suggested a so-called ‘freeze for freeze’ is
 insulting,” she said. “When a rogue regime has a nuclear weapon and an 
ICBM pointed at you, you do not take steps to lower your guard. No one 
would do that. We certainly won’t.”</p>
<p>Asked after the Security Council meeting about Haley’s “insulting” 
comment, Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told reporters he
 was “wondering” what was insulting about their proposal.</p>
<p>“This is the only proposal for a political way out,” Nebenzia said.</p>
<p>Haley also indirectly called out China for its trade with North 
Korea, saying the United States would look at every country that does 
business with Pyongyang “as a country that is giving aid to their 
reckless and dangerous intentions.”</p>
<p>She said that quickly enacting the strongest possible sanctions in 
the Security Council was the only way to resolve the issue 
diplomatically.</p>
<p>“We’ve kicked the can down the road long enough,” Haley said. “There is no more road left.”</p>
