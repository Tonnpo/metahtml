<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is fearing for his life as rumors of an assassination plot swirl, CNN reported Friday.</p>
<p>The dictator is possibly being targeted by an elite team from South 
Korea and by some within the elite circles of the communist regime.</p>

<p>"Is Kim Jong-un an assassination target? South Korea wants you to 
think he is," CNN correspondent Paula Hancocks reported. "The defense 
minister says an elite team is on standby to take him out if there's an 
imminent nuclear threat. The intelligence agency backing him up this 
week telling lawmakers they believe Kim Jong-un himself is worried about
 his personal safety, changing venues and schedules at short notice and 
buying explosives and poison detectors from overseas."</p>
<p>Hancocks also talked with a defector from North Korea, Kang Myung-do,
 a former member of North Korea's small elite and the son-in-law of a 
former prime minister. He said that he still communicates with North 
Korean officials, who are worried about Kim's behavior.</p>
<p>Hancock said that Kang told her many believe it is possible someone 
will try to kill Kim to save their own life since the North Korean 
leader is known for having important members of the elite executed in 
brutal fashion, including his <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/03/22156917-kim-jong-uns-executed-uncle-was-eaten-alive-by-120-hungry-dogs-report">own uncle</a>.</p>
<p>It has recently been <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3857548/Kim-Jong-64-traitors-executed-2016.html">reported</a> that Kim has had 64 "traitors" publicly executed this year alone.</p>
