<h1 class="rm-manual">Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?</h1>
<p>I’ve been seeing some wild speculation that this pandemic is the 
product of genetic engineering — that it’s a biowarfare weapon that 
escaped from a lab somewhere. This is nonsense. I’ll refer you to an 
article in Nature Medicine, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9">The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2</a>, which discusses a systematic analysis of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to other coronaviruses. </p>
<p>It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory 
manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus. As noted above, the
 RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an 
efficient solution different from those previously predicted. 
Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the 
several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would 
probably have been used. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that
 SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone. 
Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin 
of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic 
transfer; and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic 
transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage could have 
given rise to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>A little translation: the virus has a spike protein that binds to an 
enzyme on the surfaces of cells, called angiotensin converting enzyme, 
or ACE. This enzyme is important in regulating blood pressure, and is 
expressed by cells in lung capillaries (fun fact: your lungs play an 
endocrine role in sending out signals that maintain blood pressure). 
This is one reason the virus has such a dangerous respiratory effect — 
the lungs are the primary targets, where it can use the spike protein to
 bind to cells that express ACE and drill into them.</p>
<p>The RBD is the Receptor Binding Domain of the viral spike, and is the
 most variable part of the virus. This makes sense: the RBD is the key 
the virus uses to get access to your cells, and it varies because it 
confers target specificity. So there are all these different varieties 
of coronavirus, most of which don’t bother humans because they lack the 
human key — they are adapted to invade other animals’ cells. SARS-CoV-2 
has acquired a spike with a human unlock code. Could some cunning 
super-villain have modified the spike?</p>
<p>Not likely, for several reasons. The virus has other similarities to 
coronaviruses in other animals; it’s not a de novo construct, but is a 
member of a large family of viruses. The modification to the spike 
protein is unusual. It works, but it’s not one that scientific experts 
would have used — they would have used something that would have been 
previously modeled. Then also bioengineers have lots of clever tools 
that could be used to stuff a desired sequence into a virus, but they 
all leave tool marks, little scraps of the molecule used to do the 
replacement. Those marks aren’t there. The best explanation is that 
we’re just seeing natural selection amplifying random variations in the 
spike.</p>
<p>While the analyses above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2 
with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the interaction 
is not ideal and that the RBD sequence is different from those shown in 
SARS-CoV to be optimal for receptor binding. Thus, the high-affinity 
binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 is most likely the
 result of natural selection on a human or human-like ACE2 that permits 
another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that 
SARS-CoV-2 is not the product of purposeful manipulation.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, if I were a nefarious super-villain, we already have an 
even better RBD we could yank out of other viruses, and I would have 
used that to build a deadly virus. But instead, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is 
some clunky variation that came out of nowhere, by accident, without any
 other signs of intentional manipulation.</p>
<p>They also consider the possibility that this was an accidental 
variation acquired in a lab — if you pass a virus through a lot of host 
cells in a cell culture system, it will continue to evolve, and you 
might imagine the RBD might acquire a random variation that allows it to
 thrive in those cells, and then it accidentally escapes the lab. This 
is also unlikely, because it shares a lot of similarities with the 
pangolin coronaviruses. It’s more likely to have arisen from an existing
 pool of related viruses in the wild, then either acquired its novel 
binding site there, or after infecting humans and experiencing selection
 for better binding to human cells.</p>
<p>The best strategy is to look for intermediates in animals, or in the 
sequences of humans who were infected early in the pandemic.</p>
<p>The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as
 well as sequencing of the virus from very early cases, would similarly 
be highly informative. Irrespective of the exact mechanisms by which 
SARS-CoV-2 originated via natural selection, the ongoing surveillance of
 pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Sorry, conspiracy theorists. The best explanation is evolution and natural selection, not Evil Intelligent Design.</p>

 think the similarities to the Pangolin Coronaviruses is interesting. 
Even one of the amino acid mismatches between pangolin and covid19 can 
be explained by a single base pair change (I forget the amino acid 
change, I’m up a hill hiking – can’t dig it out right now).</p> <p class="rm-manual">I’m
 no virologist, so maybe this is naive, but is it possible for a human 
host to be exposed to two zoonotic Coronaviruses and then have them 
recombine? – the sequence from Pangolin is just so close. And iirc it 
has bat virus elements too. Live Pangolins are found in the wet markets

 but I do know this is possible. How frequently does this happen? How 
probable is it? How reasonable an explanation for the SARS-CoV-2 viral 
features would that make? Those questions I can’t answer, and it might 
be that in this particular case such recombination literally can’t 
possibly explain the features and can be excluded from the set of 
hypotheses that exhibit the minimal possible threshold of plausibility. 
I’m saying nothing about this virus, since I don’t know.</p> <p class="rm-manual">But in general, can that kind of thing happen? Yep.</p> <p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/viruses-and-evolution" rel="nofollow">Take flu viruses for example:</a></p> <blockquote class="rm-manual">
<p class="rm-manual">Antigenic Shift</p> <p class="rm-manual">Antigenic 
shift is a process by which two or more different types of influenza A 
combine to form a virus radically different from the ancestor strains. 
The virus that results has a new HA or NA subtype. Antigenic shift may 
result in global disease spread, or pandemic, because humans will have 
few or no antibodies to block infection. However, if the new influenza A
 subtype does not easily pass from person to person, the disease 
outbreak will be limited.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Antigenic shift 
occurs in two ways. First, antigenic shift can occur through genetic 
recombination, or reassortment, when two or more different influenza A 
viruses infect the same host cell and combine their genetic material. 
Influenza A viruses can infect birds, pigs, and humans, and major 
antigenic shifts can occur when these virus types combine. For example, a
 pig flu virus and a human flu virus could combine in a bird, resulting 
in a radically different flu type. If the virus infects humans and is 
efficiently transmitted among them, a pandemic may occur.</p>
</blockquote> <p class="rm-manual">There are important differences 
between corona viruses and influenza viruses, and from what I’ve heard 
(and this may not be reliable, remember IANAVirologist) the flu virus is
 apparently especially adept at swapping out proteins through 
recombination. This is why you can have a couple of viruses, say, one 
with HA group 1 and NA group 3 (making it an H1N3 flu) combine with an 
H7N1 flu inside a host and, at least in theory, end up with three viral 
forms as the two combine, taking the H1 from the first virus and the N1 
from the second virus to become a third strain, in this hypothetical an 
H1N1 flu.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Now, if the original two types were 
not particularly virulent, you might end up with the new variant being 
more transmissible and eventually one person coming into contact with 
the recombinant host is successfully infected with the new strain but 
not successfully infected by the two originating strains. Now you have a
 pure H1N1 infection that can be passed on as a single type of flu 
without the others and you wouldn’t necessarily (without a lot of work 
and a far better understanding of virology than my tidbits of half-baked
 knowledge) be able to know which strains of flu produced it – just that
 one of them had an H1 protein and another had an N1 protein. The 
NA-protein of the first and the HA-protein of the second could (at least
 in theory) be forever unknown.</p> <p class="rm-manual">So your 
conjecture isn’t laughably impossible, at least not from the point of 
view of viruses in general. Whether coronaviruses are able to do this 
might be a separate question from whether or not viruses in general 
might sometimes have this capacity.</p> <p class="rm-manual">My best 
guess, however, would be that coronaviruses do have this capability, but
 not to the degree that influenza viruses have it (since I’ve heard 
science journalists say that influenza is more capable than the average 
virus of such recombination, and without specific evidence we’d be best 
assuming that coronaviruses only exhibit an average ability for viruses 
to do this, which would be non-zero, but less than flu viruses).</p> <p class="rm-manual">Hope
 that helps. If you want real info though, i suggest digging through 
google scholar a bit. There’s always good stuff to find there.</p> </article> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>KG</span> <span>says</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2020/03/28/where-did-sars-cov-2-come-from/#comment-2037366">28 March 2020 at 1:17 pm</a> </p> <p class="rm-manual">I
 hadn’t known about the similarities to pangolin coronaviruses – only 
those of bats – although I’d heard the idea that pangolins were an 
intermediate host. That perhaps makes it more likely the Wuhan “wet

 The cell surface protein that SARS-CoV2 binds to is ACE2 (not ACE). 
They both function to regulate blood pressure, but play different roles.
 ACE converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin 1 (Agt1), which has the 
effect of constricting blood vessels. This is why ACE inhibitors are 
prescribed for people with hypertension. ACE2 converts Agt1 to Agt2, 
which dilates blood vessels.</p> <p class="rm-manual">This also means 
that if you are currently on an ACE inhibitor you shouldn’t have 
anything to worry about, and the recommendation from health care 
professionals is to stay on the drug. Uncontrolled hypertension may be a
 risk factor for SARS-CoV2 infection, as it turns out, and this may be 
explained by compensatory changes that the body enacts under these 
circumstances…an upregulation of ACE2, which has anti-hypertensive 
effects.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The basic idea is that anything that 
enhances the binding of SARS-CoV2 to ACE2 can elevate your risk, 
including increased levels of ACE2 protein, or other co-factors that may
 promote the interaction.</p> <p class="rm-manual">2) ACE2 is indeed 
expressed in airway epithelial cells but also on many other cells of the
 body. Among these are those lining the gut, and also in the brain and 
other organs. There is some recent evidence that the anosmia associated 
with infections in some patients has to do with the effect on olfactory 
neuroepithelial cells in the nasal cavity, for example.</p> </article> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/intransitive/" rel="external nofollow">Intransitive</a></span> <span>says</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2020/03/28/where-did-sars-cov-2-come-from/#comment-2037388">28 March 2020 at 2:39 pm</a> </p> <p class="rm-manual">Charly (#7) –</p> <p class="rm-manual">The

 this case at least I think some people reach for the conspiracy theory 
because it offers a degree of safety or security. No matter how 
complicated , implausible and contradictory the conspiracy may be it is 
of human design or even alien design and thus it is something we can 
identify and fight. It gives a focus of human scale to it. It is not

 don’t think a desire for security can be the answer because most 
conspiracy theories posit a world that is less safe. Others have said 
it’s a desire for certainty, but that doesn’t explain the many 
conspiracy theories that reject knowledge that is as certain as we can 
ever get. Possibly it’s something to do with the human psychological 
trend to see our successes as our own work and our failures due to 
external forces, but even then I don’t see why people have to construct 
such ridiculous stories when there are far more coherent ones to choose 
from.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The funny thing is I have known myself to
 occasionally construct minor conspiracy theories to explain things — I

 Electoral Vote site (electoral-vote.com) is an excellent resource run 
by two college professors — one who works in the field of computer 
science/statistics and the other who is a historian. A recurring feature
 on their web site is fielding reader questions on Saturdays.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Here is what they said about this on the Electoral Vote site on Saturday (content warning — description of a sexual assault):</p> <blockquote class="rm-manual">
<p class="rm-manual">Just so everyone is on the same page, the story 
being referenced is Tara Reade’s claim that she was sexually assaulted 
by Joe Biden back in 1993, while she was working for him. Here is the 
key portion of her narrative:</p> <p class="rm-manual">He just had me up
 against the wall. I was wearing like a skirt, a business skirt. I 
wasn’t wearing stockings. It was kind of a hot day that day, and I was 
wearing heels…I remember I was wearing a blouse, and he just had me up 
against the wall. And the wall was cold. It happened all at once…his 
hands were on me and underneath my clothes. Yeah, and he went down my 
skirt but then up inside it, and he penetrated me with his fingers, and 
he was kissing me at the same time, and he was saying something to me. 
He said several things. I can’t remember everything he said.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Biden, of course, has denied this.</p> <p class="rm-manual">It
 does not appear to be centrally coordinated; in fact, it started on one
 end of the political spectrum and then jumped to the other. You’re 
right that the story definitely did not gain traction, despite the fact 
that many mainstream outlets took a look at it. Here are some guesses as
 to why:</p> <p class="rm-manual">** The “#MeToo Moment” Has Passed: 
There was a period of time there, right after the Harvey Weinstein and 
Bill Cosby stories broke, that the mere whiff of sexual impropriety was 
career-ending. Perhaps the most obvious person caught up in this was 
former senator Al Franken, who was compelled to resign his office before
 an investigation could be conducted. It is the case that sexual assault
 claims are taken much more seriously these days than they used to be, 
as well they should. But we seem to have exited the time in which a mere
 accusation was seen as proof of guilt.</p> <p class="rm-manual">** Is 
Reade Trustworthy?: The general progression of events does not increase 
confidence in Reade’s account. The first problem is that she didn’t tell
 anyone at the time that she was assaulted, and she did not come forward
 with the story until a quarter-century had passed. Second, she came 
forward previously, and was one of the women who accused Biden of 
inappropriate hugging/touching, but didn’t mention anything beyond that.
 Third, she has been an outspoken anti-Biden and pro-Sanders voice on 
social media (and, in fact, when she made the assault allegations, she 
did so to a staunchly left-leaning website, The Intercept). None of this
 proves she is lying, but it certainly does raise some concerns about 
her veracity and her motivations.</p> <p class="rm-manual">** Out of 
Character for Biden: There is no question that Biden grew up with a 
1950s/1960s sense of boundaries, a sense out of step with where we’re at
 today. But, unlike Bill Clinton, Brett Kavanaugh, Anthony Wiener, and 
other plausibly accused alleged perpetrators of sexual assault, Biden’s 
never been associated with any misconduct beyond that. There is a huge 
chasm between “inappropriate hug” and “violent sexual assault.” It’s 
highly unusual for someone to jump over that chasm with no 
intermediate/gateway steps. It’s even more unusual for it to happen 
exactly one time. And thus far, nobody else has come forward with claims
 like Reade’s.</p> <p class="rm-manual">** Right Wing Framing: After The
 Intercept ran the story, right-wing media grabbed it and ran with it. 
Interestingly, most of them had a headline or a lede that included the 
formulation “Joe Biden Said He Believes All Women. Does He Believe Tara 
Reade?” That’s a very unusual framing, one that downplays the more 
serious crime of sexual assault, and plays up Biden’s alleged hypocrisy 
(which is, of course, not a crime). Framing things in that way certainly
 makes it seem like even the right-wingers don’t really think Biden 
assaulted Reade, and instead they’re trying to use this as a “gotcha.”</p> <p class="rm-manual">**
 Going to the Well Too Many Times: Shamefully, a number of folks (most 
commonly hacky right-wing operatives) have tried to use 100% fabricated 
claims of sexual misconduct to smear political opponents. The most 
notable case of this is probably the comically inept Jacob Wohl, who 
tried to smear special counsel Robert Mueller in this manner, and then 
tried it again with Pete Buttigieg. This has undoubtedly put the idea in
 people’s minds that when a sexual assault claim seems like in might 
fail the smell test, it might just be a political hit job.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Anyhow,
 these are our guesses. We think it’s instructive that Donald Trump has 
yet to deploy this against Biden. If there was any chance it could 
stick, and was going to become an element of the 2020 campaign, surely 
the President would have tossed it out there already.</p> <p class="rm-manual">And yes, propaganda is best ignored.</p>

 was a reader response to their commentary on the Tara Reade story today
 (Sunday is the day they run reader comments). Here is what one reader 
said in response:</p> <blockquote class="rm-manual">
<p class="rm-manual">I really appreciate you answering the question 
about Tara Reade and the anti-Biden propaganda push. You make excellent 
points, but I have two comments.</p> <p class="rm-manual">First, you 
left out what happened with the Time’s Up fund, who declined to fund 
legal and PR fees for Reade because the appearance of them being 
political would threaten their 501(c)(3) status. In response, some sites
 have cried “cover-up.” However, Time’s Up could have safely helped Tara
 Reade (despite Joe Biden being a presidential candidate) as long as 
they used their normal procedure to decide whether to help. Doesn’t it 
make more sense that they used their normal procedure to evaluate 
Reade’s claims, and (they, like you) found them unconvincing?</p> <p class="rm-manual">Second,
 you say that this story did not gain traction, and you also say that it
 is instructive that Trump has not deployed this against Biden, but you 
ignore something important. Does Trump know a better way to harm Biden 
with this than using it against him directly (and appearing to be the 
pot calling the kettle black).</p> <p class="rm-manual">In the last 
week, I have been inundated with messages from my relatives and friends 
who are Sanders supporters, all of them saying exactly the same thing: 
that because of this one accusation of sexual assault, they refuse to 
vote for Biden for president. So this is splintering the Democrats, 
which can only help Trump. I have no idea who is spreading this, but it 
seems to be working, and there are plenty of actors (Republicans, 
Sanders supporters, Russians, etc.) who would benefit. Plus, this is 
eerily similar to the way that fear, uncertainty, and doubt was used 
against Clinton during the 2016 election.</p>

 never been a victim of sexual assault, but after hearing many accounts 
Ive noticed that it never went from “He touched me inappropriately” to 
“He raped me” in regards to recalling what happened. I know from reading
 accounts that memory of the event is not reliable, but that’s with the 
details. Never seen a victim not recall the actual attack or recall it 
as something that was a lot milder. Especially not during MeToo when the
 accusations were made public.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I’ll be blunt 
here. I don’t believe her. I understand why the whole must believe women
 is a thing from reading this blog. I understand that not believing 
women is why so many rapists get away with what they did. Its why I 
included the trigger warning because I don’t want to upset people who’ve
 been through this bullshit. But I also think enough time has passed 
with MeToo for it to be weaponized. And Ive hung around Sanders 
supporters long enough to know that the more zealous among us are 
perfectly capable of doing this. For fucks sake, with Hillary Clinton, a
 common nickname for her was Killary. They accused her of both

 But we seem to have exited the time in which a mere accusation was seen
 as proof of guilt.&lt;\q&gt; That’s a big red flag to me. When getting

 first problem is that she didn’t tell anyone at the time that she was

sexual harassment and assault seriously this isn’t surprising.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Second,
 she came forward previously, and was one of the women who accused Biden
 of inappropriate hugging/touching, but didn’t mention anything beyond 
that. &lt;\q&gt; So what? This person must not have actually listened to
 the interview because they explained why they didn’t tell the rest, 
they didn’t think they were being taken seriously so they didn’t go on 
to the more difficult material.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Third, she has 
been an outspoken anti-Biden and pro-Sanders voice on social media (and,
 in fact, when she made the assault allegations, she did so to a 
staunchly left-leaning website, The Intercept).&lt;\q&gt; A person’s 
politics don’t mean they weren’t a sexual assault victim. I was hoping 
for better from the left.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Going to the Well Too

false claims to judge uninvestigated claims is prejudiced.</p> <p class="rm-manual">They
 can be as upset as they want but it’s not the accusers fault if some

 Biden’s accuser accused him of being creepy with respect to boundaries 
during the CreepyJoe controversy about Biden’s inappropriate touching 
and lack of respect to boundaries. And then now during the primary that 
same accusation now turned to “Actually he raped me”. Ive never seen a 
victim of rape change her story in such a way. I find it suspect 
primarily because Ive never seen this before. Ive never seen a victim of
 sexual assault downplay their own assault during MeToo era. Maybe it is
 true, but its suspect. Especially now late into the primary, where a 
lot of Sanderites are still fighting for their candidate, and still 
believe he can win. I fully admit that I might be wrong as I’ve never 
been a victim of this.</p> <p class="rm-manual">And yes I did read the 
entire interview. Saying “I didn’t think anyone would believe me” during
 a time when most people would believe you with “believe all women” 
doesn’t sound convincing. Especially during a time when the pressure on 
Biden’s inappropriateness was not just highlighted but national 
conversation. Saying she didn’t think anyone would take her seriously 
during a time when Biden’s inappropriateness was national conversation 
is not convincing. And as a Sanders supporter I know the worst among us 
are perfectly capable of false allegations. This is why I mention Seth 
Rich conspiracy and “Killary Clinton”.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I think 
as a leftist this person understands rape culture enough to use it

 cant just say other accusations have no bearing on this one because 
these things don’t happen in a vacuum. When the “left progressives” are 
actively accusing candidates they don’t like of murder without evidence,
 they’ve poison the well. False rape allegations would be the next step.
 People already tried to do it, but not leftists. It was only a matter 
of time considering the conspiracy theories they delve with.</p> <p class="rm-manual">And
 lets me be clear, I’m no centrist (though Ive been called one by these 
people) and I don’t care for Biden. I voted Sanders. Even voted early. 
My problem is that since last election Ive viewed progressives as a 
whole negatively through my experience being among them. Many of them 
prefer a right wing president over an establishment democrat. Their 
anti-establishmentarianism is less about making the world better than it
 is a dogmatic mantra that must be upheld. This wouldn’t be 
uncharacteristic of that bunch.</p> <p class="rm-manual">At the end of 
the day there’s no way of knowing whether the accusation was true or 
not. This is a case involving politics now. Not Hollywood, or academia, 
or other institutions of power where false allegations of anything are 
rare and false allegations of rape specifically are even rarer still. 
No, false allegations here are the norm. Pizzagate, her emails, Seth 
Rich, dnc rigging the primary, Hillary committing war crimes somehow, 
Benghazi, I could go on and on.</p> <p class="rm-manual">To paraphrase 
someone from Biden’s staff “Women have the right to tell their story, 
and reporters have the obligation to vet those claims.” So vet away. If 
more evidence that he did it surfaces, then we know the truth now. Right
 now as it stands, she has a lot going against her. The changing the 
story for one, and the fact that her past tweets before 2016 election 
about Biden have been positive. Those are two things working against 
her. On a personal level, her being pro Sanders is a red flag, but thats
 on me and my experience.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I also want to hear 
the opinions of victims on this. Maybe I’m being an idiot, I don’t know.
 I’m a man whose never been sexually assaulted. Physically and 
emotionally abused yes, but not sexually. My opinion on the accusations
