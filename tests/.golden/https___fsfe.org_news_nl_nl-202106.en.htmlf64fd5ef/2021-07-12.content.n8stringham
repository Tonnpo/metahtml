<h1 class="rm-manual">Rising demands for Dutch digital autonomy +++ REUSE Booster +++ Torsten Grote</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span>onÂ </span>2021-06-28Â </p>
<p> Dutch digital public services rely increasingly on monopolistic 
companies; the FSFE Dutch team actively demands digital rights. In June,
 we launched REUSE Booster to share legal advice with Free Software 
projects on copyright. We interviewed Torsten Grote, a member of the 
FSFE, who stressed the need to Free our Androids early on. </p>
<h2>Dutch Digital Autonomy is undermined; demands for Free Software are rising </h2>
<p> The Netherlands is becoming dependent on a digital infrastructure 
that is dominated by a small number of monopolistic companies. Although 
the Dutch Cyber Security Council recognises the consequent risk, their 
report neglects focusing on Open Standards and Free Software, the proven
 best practices to face this problem. The FSFE calls on the Dutch 
government to stand firm and <a href="file:///news/2021/news-20210521-01.en.html">get a grip on their digital security and autonomy by adhering to Open Standards and Free Software</a>, in line with their earlier commitment to use Free Software by default. </p>
<p> Our team emphatically defends digital rights in the Netherlands. In 
2018, Jos van den Oever noticed that the 'Debat Direct' app could not be
 downloaded to his Firefox OS phone. In other words, the official 
application for parliamentary debates was not available under a Free 
Software license. Jos' request to get the app's source code was denied, 
and he brought the case to court. The Council of State ruled on 31 March
 2021 that the Parliament does not have to publish the source code. As a
 result, the <a href="file:///news/2021/news-20210611-01.en.html">participation app remains closed</a> to those who wish to use only Free Software apps. </p>
<p> Jos van den Oever, the person behind this initiative, is a FSFE 
volunteer and part of our country team Netherlands. Its members kept in 
touch even during the pandemic, when they had to replace booths for 
online meetings. Nico Rikken, one of the two coordinators, shares his 
experiences about this transition in a blogpost, and <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/nico.rikken/2021/06/23/how-the-netherlands-group-grew-in-covid-times/">calls anyone interested to join the FSFE community based in the Netherlands</a>. </p>
<figcaption>FSFE spot in a non-profit hacker-camp. The Netherlands, 2017.</figcaption><h2>REUSE Booster supports Free Software projects with licensing</h2>
<p> REUSE has facilitated the licensing of Free Software projects. 
Developers are given standardised ways to mark all files in a project 
with their chosen license and copyright notice. A tutorial, a set of 
FAQs, a helper tool, and an API have been made available to lower the 
threshold and save time. </p>
<p> With REUSE Booster, the FSFE takes this initiative a step further. <a href="file:///news/2021/news-20210609-01.en.html">Free Software projects can seek tailored support</a>
 with licensing and copyright by legal experts now. Each project will be
 evaluated individually and the recommendations will apply to its 
particular situation. <a href="https://reuse.software/booster/">Register</a> until 8 July to get your Free Software project on board. </p>
<h2>20 Years FSFE: Envisioning free operating systems in smartphones with Torsten Grote</h2>
<p> In our fourth birthday publication we reminisce about the emergence of the first smartphones. We are <a href="file:///news/2021/news-20210625-01.en.html">interviewing</a>
 Torsten Grote, who explored Free Software alternatives for smartphones 
as early as 2012. A programmer as well as a Free Software activist, 
Torsten shares his memories of the developments of alternative operating
 systems and applications for smartphones. Finally, we would not miss 
this chance to ask him what options there are today for liberating our 
phones. </p>

 We are moving from Freenode to Libera Chat, following the migration of 
its network of volunteer staff. We share our thoughts that led the FSFE

administration, your library, your university, your city, your region, 
or your country. </li> <li> On June 16th, the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/action/show/LocalGroups/BNL">Netherlands-based FSFE</a>

the FSFE Berlin local group met for their regular meeting which focuses 
on Education. Miriam from "Die Lernwerkstatt" introduced this 
organisation and gave a talk on the design of digital learning with tips
 on related platforms and techniques. A group discussion followed. In 
the Berlin Fellowship group, everyone is invited to discuss "Free 
Software and Education", share experiences, and work on liberating

<p class="rm-manual"> Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to control technology. </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our 
lives. It is important that this technology empowers rather than 
restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, study, 
share, and improve software. These rights help support other fundamental
 rights like freedom of speech, freedom of press, and privacy. </p>
