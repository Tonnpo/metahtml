<p>As educational institutions, groups and religious organisations 
continue to cancel programs, close schools and ban public gatherings 
over the fear of the deadly Coronavirus also known as COVID-19, the 
management of The Polytechnic Ibadan, on Sunday said it has closed the 
institution until further notice.</p>
<p>Registrar of the institution, Modupe Theresa Fawale, in a statement 
made available to GCFRNG in Ibadan, maintained that the decision was in 
consonance with the directive of the Oyo state government.</p>
<p>She, however, advised students to vacate hostels of the institution with immediate effect.</p>
<p>Fawale said, “In line with the directive of the Oyo State Government,
 the management of The Polytechnic, Ibadan has closed down the 
institution till further notice.</p>
<p>“Students will be communicated of re-opening as soon as possible. All
 students are therefore requested to vacate the Halls of residence 
immediately.”</p>
<p>Fawale, while speaking on the preventive measures to curtail the 
spread of the deadly Coronavirus, insisted that the institution has 
suspended all international conferences to be hosted by the faculties.</p>
<p>She added that all international travels by staff are suspended until further notice.</p>
<p>All incoming and outgoing exchange programmes as well as 
international visits of foreign partners and collaborators have been 
suspended until further notice, according to her.</p>
<p>“As part of precautionary measures to prevent members of The 
Polytechnic, Ibadan community from contracting Corona Virus (COVID-19). 
Management in consultation with the Director Medical Services, The 
Polytechnic, Ibadan has taken the following measures:</p>
<p>“All international conferences to be hosted by the faculties should 
be suspended until further notice. All international travels by staff 
are suspended until further notice.</p>
<p>“All incoming and outgoing exchange programmes as well as 
international visits of foreign partners and collaborators are suspended
 until further notice.</p>
<p>“Staff already out on international travel should inform the 
Management of the Institution on arrival by contacting the Director, 
Medical Services on 07030712065. Such person is strongly advised to 
self-isolate for at least fourteen (14) days before reporting to the 
office.</p>
<p>“All Departments, Faculties, Units, Halls of Residence, places of 
worship and other places with high concentration of people on campus are
 hereby advised to make provision for or resuscitate facilities for 
hand-washing in their immediate environment to encourage routine 
hand-wash. Adequate signs indicating such should also be provided.</p>
<p>“Individuals are advised to have alcohol-based hand sanitiser at 
homes and their other immediate surroundings to complement the 
preventive measures provided in the offices and work environment. 
Internal programme organisers, halls and event centres are to make hand 
sanitisers available on site.</p>
<p>“Heads of department and office holders should encourage local 
implementation of these preventive measures in their various offices.</p>
<p>Management is working to complement the recommended preventive measures. A monitoring team will go round to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>“As much as possible, handshakes and other body contacts should be 
avoided. There is no need for anyone to panic. The above are 
precautionary measures as personal health consciousness and health 
education on prevention is still considered a major intervention against
 COVID-19 and similar diseases.</p>
<p>“Management and Director of Medical Services, The Polytechnic, Health
 Centre will collaborate to provide further enlightenment to members on 
the COVID-19.</p>
