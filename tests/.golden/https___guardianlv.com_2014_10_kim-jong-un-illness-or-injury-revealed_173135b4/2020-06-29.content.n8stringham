<p class="rm-manual"><span>By <span><a href="https://guardianlv.com/author/haugh-l/" rel="author">Leigh Haugh</a></span> on October 29, 2014</span><span><a href="https://guardianlv.com/2014/10/kim-jong-un-illness-or-injury-revealed/#respond">No Comment</a></span></p>
<p> Kim Jong Un, the North Korean dictator who had been publicly absent 
in recent weeks, re-emerged on October 14 with a cane and many questions
 unanswered. There has been a great deal of speculation about whether or
 not the communist leader has suffered illness or injury, as well as his
 possible vulnerability to a coup by opposition leaders. In the wake of 
Kim’s return to the public spotlight, new details have been revealed 
about his suspected illness or injury.</p>
<p>The National Intelligence Service, which is South Korea’s spy agency,
 told legislators that a foreign doctor was consulted and operated on 
Kim Jong Un in either September or October 2014 to remove a cyst from 
his ankle, according to opposition leaders. Moreover, the officials 
commented that the spy agency also told lawmakers in a closed-door 
session that the cyst could recur because of Kim’s health habits and 
chaotic public schedule.</p>
<p>According to reports, Kim Jong Un has a condition known as tarsal 
tunnel syndrome. The syndrome is often painful and it is caused by the 
compression of a nerve, which can result due to a cyst. Surgery is 
generally viewed as a last resort after other treatments are deemed 
unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Following Kim Jong Un’s appearance with his wife at a function 
covered by the state media on September 3, the North Korean leader 
disappeared from public view for 6 weeks, and when he reappeared on 
October 14, he was seen hobbling with a cane and appeared slimmer. Prior
 to his absence, Kim was seen with a noticeable limb and there were also
 reports that revealed he had injured himself during military training 
exercises in August 2014. During his absence, wild media speculation 
about Kim’s illness or injury was especially significant because of the 
Kim family’s importance to poor, combative, and nuclear-armed nation. 
This is because the Kim family has ruled the country since its creation 
in 1948.</p>
<p>According to experts, individuals who suffer from this disorder and 
require surgical intervention should not apply any weight to the 
affected region for 10 days after the operation, and an improvement in 
symptoms could take as long as two to three months. If these reports are
 in fact true, the timing of Kim Jong Un’s disappearance from the public
 arena would make sense.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Kim So Yeon, who served as personal physician to Kim
 Jong Un’s grandfather, the North Korean leader has also inherited a 
number of health concerns, including psychological problems and a 
history of obesity. Moreover, she added that both Kim’s father, Kim Jong
 Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung, suffered from diabetes, stress 
disorders, and heart ailments.</p>
<p>Now that Kim Jong Un has returned to the public stage following an 
unexpected and lengthy six-week absence, new details have been revealed 
regarding the world leader’s suspected illness or injury. It has been 
revealed that the North Korean leader recently had surgery to remove a 
cyst from his ankle and inherited a litany of medical concerns, as well 
as suffers from a history of obesity and psychological issues. In 
addition to the medical concerns surrounding Kim, a political purge, in 
the wake of the execution of Kim’s uncle, Jang Song Thaek, has continued
 in North Korea, which has captured the attention of South Korean 
lawmakers and other world leaders, as well as continues to raise a 
ominous eyebrow on Kim Jong Un.</p>
