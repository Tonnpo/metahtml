<h1 class="rm-manual">Kim Jong Un warns of ‘shocking’ action in the face of US pressure</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="file:///news/world-news/">World News</a> | Published: Jan 2, 2020 </p>
<p>The North Korean leader has ramped up his rhetoric against Washington over nuclear negotiations.</p>
<p>Expressing deep frustration over stalled nuclear talks, North Korean 
leader Kim Jong Un warned of unspecified “shocking” action and said his 
country would soon reveal a new “strategic weapon” to the world as its 
bolstered its nuclear deterrent in face of “gangster-like” US pressure.</p>
<p>Mr Kim also said North Korea was no longer obliged to maintain a 
self-imposed suspension on the testing of nuclear weapons and 
intercontinental ballistic missiles, which President Donald Trump has 
touted as a major diplomatic accomplishment.</p>
<p>But Mr Kim gave no clear indication a resumption of such tests was 
impending and appeared to leave the door open for eventual negotiations.</p>
<p>Mr Kim has used the diplomatic stalemate to expand his military 
capabilities by intensifying tests of shorter-range weapons. His arsenal
 is now estimated to include 40-50 nuclear bombs and various delivery 
systems, including solid-fuel missiles designed to beat missile-defence 
systems, and developmental ICBMs potentially capable of reaching the US 
mainland.</p>
<p>Mr Kim has also strengthened his negotiating position, moving the 
diplomacy closer to an arms reduction negotiation between nuclear states
 rather than talks that would culminate in a unilateral surrender of the
 weapons he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.</p>
<p>Lee Sang-min, spokesman for South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said 
North Korea carrying out its threat to showcase a new strategic weapon 
would be unhelpful for diplomacy.</p>
<p>Strategic weapons usually refer to nuclear-capable delivery systems 
such as ICBMs, but North Korea otherwise has been vague about what new 
arms it would display.</p>
<p>It announced in December it had performed two “crucial” tests at its 
long-range rocket launch site that would further strengthen its nuclear 
deterrent.</p>
<p>Mr Kim’s latest comments, published in state media on Wednesday, were
 made at a four-day meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central 
Committee as talks between Washington and Pyongyang have faltered over 
disagreements on disarmament steps and the removal of sanctions.</p>

monitor Donald Trump’s impeachment trial before taking its next 
substantive step in denuclearisation talks (Ahn Young-joon/AP)</figcaption><p>Mr
 Kim may instead seek to strengthen his leverage by promoting a united 
front with Beijing and Moscow, Pyongyang’s traditional supporters, which
 seek to establish themselves as major stakeholders in North Korean 
diplomacy. Both have called for the UN Security Council to consider 
easing sanctions on the North to spur progress in nuclear negotiations.</p>
<p>UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Secretary-General António 
Guterres “very much hopes that the tests will not resume,” citing 
existing Security Council resolutions. “Non-proliferation remains a 
fundamental pillar of global nuclear security and must be preserved,” 
the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Mr Kim last year had said the North would pursue a “new way” if the 
Trump administration did not make concessions to salvage the 
negotiations by the end of December.</p>
<p>His defiant words entering 2020 indicate his “new way” could look 
very much like the old one — a patient determination to wait out 
sanctions and pressure, which will possibly weaken over time, while 
cementing the country’s status as a nuclear state.</p>
<p>At the party meeting, Mr Kim declared the North would never give up 
its security for economic benefits in the face of what he described as 
increasing US hostility and nuclear threats, the Korean Central News 
Agency said.</p>
<p>“(Mr Kim) said that we will never allow the impudent US to abuse the 
DPRK-US dialogue for meeting its sordid aim but will shift to a shocking
 actual action to make it pay for the pains sustained by our people so 
far and for the development so far restrained,” the agency said, 
referring to the North by its formal name, the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Mr Kim added that “if the US persists in its hostile policy toward 
the DPRK, there will never be the denuclearisation on the Korean 
Peninsula and the DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite 
strategic weapons for the security of the state until the US rolls back 
its hostile policy,” KCNA said.</p>
<p>“(Mr Kim) confirmed that the world will witness a new strategic 
weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future, declaring that we
 cannot give up the security of our future just for the visible economic
 results … now that hostile acts and nuclear threat against us are 
increasing,” it said.</p>
<p>Mr Trump on Tuesday urged Mr Kim to stick to his alleged commitment 
to denuclearise. After their first summit in Singapore in June 2018 the 
two leaders issued a vague statement on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula 
without saying when and how it would occur.</p>
<p>“Look, he likes me, I like him, we get along,” Mr Trump said as he 
entered a New Year’s party at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.</p>
<p>“But he did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement talking about 
denuclearisation … I think he’s a man of his word so we’re going to find
 out, but I think he’s a man of his word.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">North Korea has held to its self-imposed moratorium
 on nuclear and ICBM testing since 2018, though last year it ended a 
17-month pause in ballistic activity by testing a slew of solid-fuel 
weapons that potentially expanded its capabilities to strike targets in 
South Korea and Japan, including US military bases there.</p>
