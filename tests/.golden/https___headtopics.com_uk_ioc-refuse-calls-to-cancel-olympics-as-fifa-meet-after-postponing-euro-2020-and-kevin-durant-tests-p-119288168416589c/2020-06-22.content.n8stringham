<p>Dissent grows over Olympics resisting postponementThe International 
Olympic Committee is facing its strongest headwinds in decades as it 
prepares to brief national committees on Wednesday on the state of the 
Tokyo 2020 Olympics amid the coronavirus pandemic, with voices of 
dissent growing louder.</p>

<p>The IOC has remained committed to staging the Tokyo Games as planned 
from July 24-Aug. 9, saying on Tuesday after a meeting with 
international sports federations that measures against the virus were 
delivering results.The coronavirus has so far killed more than 7,500 
people and infected about 200,000, with the epicentre now in Europe.</p>
<p>The IOC has refused to publicly consider cancellation or postponement
 as possible options, even as other major events including soccer's Euro
 2020 and Copa America and the French Open tennis grand slam announced 
postponements on Tuesday.The virus has also wreaked havoc with Olympic 
qualification tournaments with athletes struggling to train, travel or 
compete and many pre-Games qualifiers cancelled or postponed.</p>
<p>IOC member Hayley Wickenheiser called the decision to proceed with 
the Games"insensitive and irresponsible" in the most vocal attack on the
 Olympic body since President Thomas Bach took over in 
2013.Wickenheiser, who competed in five Winter Games in ice hockey and 
at the 2000 Summer Olympics in softball, said continuing with the Games 
as planned ignored the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>"This crisis is bigger than even the Olympics," Wickenheiser said in a
 statement on Twitter."Athletes can't train. Attendees can't travel 
plan. Sponsors and marketers can't market with a degree of 
sensitivity.""I think the IOC insisting this will move ahead, with such 
conviction, is insensitive and irresponsible given the state of 
humanity."</p>
<p>She is not alone.Several athletes, including reigning Olympic pole 
vault champion Katerina Stefanidi, said the IOC decision was putting 
athletes' health at risk, urging them to train as normal when entire 
countries have shut down to contain the virus spread.</p>
<p>"There is no postponement, no cancellation. But it (the IOC) is 
putting us at risk," Stefanidi said in an exclusive interview to 
Reuters."We all want Tokyo to happen but what is the Plan B if it does 
not happen?"Knowing about a possible option has a major effect on my 
training because I may be taking risks now that I would not take if I 
knew there was also the possibility of a Plan B." </p>

<p>take a long hard look at the IOC and how it;s business model is 
designed. there is a level of corruption beyond anything seen before.

2020 ‚Äòas best they can‚Äô, saying it contradicts government information on

this year The Olympics are all about money, not about sport.</p>
<p>IOC rules out staging Tokyo Olympic Games behind closed doorsThe 
Olympic Games in Tokyo will have spectators if it goes ahead as planned 
Empty stadiums are not the issue. The issue is, are you going to have 
your athletes live in the mass accommodations of Olympic Village? That's
 the issue. No one is going to attend to watch the games as infection 
rate is still high in Japan. There will be so much restrictions and long
 queue for health check before going inside any 
events/restaurants/airports etc, it will just take the fun out of 
watching.</p>
