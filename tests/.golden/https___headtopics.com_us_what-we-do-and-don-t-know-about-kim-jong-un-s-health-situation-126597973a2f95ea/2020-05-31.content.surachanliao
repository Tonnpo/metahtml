<p>U.S. sources say the North Korean leader is in critical condition, but South Korea is telling a different story.</p>
<p>U.S. sources say the North Korean leader is in critical condition, but South Korea is telling a different story.</p>
<p>His absence came after he had a cardiovascular procedure on April 
12,, a South Korean online newspaper covering news on North Korea. The 
report cited a single North Korean source, who speculated the surgery 
may be tied to Kim‚Äôs obesity, smoking habit or ‚Äúoverwork.‚Äù</p>

<p>South Korea is contradicting these reportsConfusion over Kim‚Äôs health
 grew Tuesday as South Korean officials issued a 
statementcontradictingreports on Kim‚Äôs health by American media 
outlets.‚ÄúWe confirm that Chairman Kim Jong Un is currently touring 
provincial areas with his close aides and we do not detect evidences to 
support speculation about his ill health,‚Äù President Moon Jae-in‚Äôs 
office said in a statement.</p>
<p>KCNA KCNA / ReutersSouth Korea has contradicted U.S. media claims 
that Kim is in dangerously poor health right now. ‚ÄúEven North Korea‚Äôs 
Worker‚Äôs Party, military or cabinet aren‚Äôt showing any special movements
 such as emergency decree. We believe that Chairman Kim is active as 
normal as he has been,‚Äù the office said.</p>
<p>The South Korean currencytook a hitafter reports about Kim‚Äôs health 
broke.The lack of clarity on Kim‚Äôs health reflects how difficult it is 
to confirm anything happening in the closed-off dictatorship. North 
Korea has stricter controls on media than any other country in the 
world, and the government has a tight hold on what information gets in 
or out.</p>
<p>In 2011, for example, the country managed to conceal then-leader Kim 
Jong Il‚Äôs death for two days. Officials are suspected ofsome of the 
details about his death to make it seem nobler than it was, as 
projecting an image of a strong, invincible leader is a key element of 
North Korea‚Äôs politics.</p>
<p>He is suspected to have generally poor healthGiven the instability 
his death could cause, the global community has long.The supreme leader 
reportedly smokes and drinks in excess. Experts on Kim have also pointed
 to hissignificant weight gainwhile in office, which could be dangerous 
for him given reports he is diabetic and has high blood pressure.</p>

 Kim take medical advice from Donald? I wouldn't believe 'US sources' if
 they told me that the sky was blue I hope he lives out his life in a
