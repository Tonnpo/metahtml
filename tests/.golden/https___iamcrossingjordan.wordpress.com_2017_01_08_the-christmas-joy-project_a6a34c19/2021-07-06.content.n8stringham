<p class="rm-manual"> <a rel="author" href="https://iamcrossingjordan.wordpress.com/author/beersohana/">Tracey Beers</a> / <a href="https://iamcrossingjordan.wordpress.com/2017/01/08/the-christmas-joy-project/">January 8, 2017</a> </p>
<p>“When obstacles tempt us to give up, God’s Word calls us to give 
away.” (my New Spirit-Filled Life Bible, p1398. I love that Bible)</p>
<p>Christmas is the season of giving. Just writing this blog post is an 
act of giving on my end. Really. I loathe public opinion. I disdain my 
own visceral reaction to WordPress stats, Facebook like’s, and even the 
dreaded public opinion contrary – silence. I hated my own heart after 
writing blog posts so much that last winter that I ran. Like a fugitive,
 I ran out of the blogging world screaming.</p>
<p>“Tell me I can quit!” I screamed. “Tell me I can throw out the 
crayons I use to scribble stories, and the binoculars I stare through 
looking for my loyal tribe of readers. Tell me I can quit!”</p>
<p>And Praise the Lord for His mercy. For just as soon as this 
proverbial toddler stopped pounding her foot, He scooped me up, drew me 
close, and breathed James Earl Jones deep:</p>
<p>“Now you’re talking, dear one. Quit. Quit scrutinizing. Quit 
scrambling. Quit your frenzied spiral dance and whipping up wild dust. 
But never, ever, ever stop giving.”</p>
<p>He has a way of doing that, doesn’t He? Taking your pain in exchange for a cure?</p>
<p>Unwittingly, I had been writing to earn approval. Your approval. (A 
distressing and laborious burden that one). But Jesus. He took my 
feverish offerings and exchanged them holy opportunity. On the cross, 
Jesus opened up a whole new way of giving. We can no longer pay or 
sacrifice our way into God’s mercy. Our giving is no longer a debt that 
we owe (anyone!) but a seed that we sew. (paraphrased from that Bible 
again. p.1398).</p>
<p>And then. Then He set my feet upon a rock I could never climb alone. “You need to make this,” He said:</p>
<p>No, I had never made something like this before. No, I don’t own 
power tools. No, I don’t even have one of those nifty Cricut machines to
 help make a stencil for this project.</p>
<p>So, I shelved the idea until He felt the need to clue me in on just 
how and why this was to be done. In the mean time, I ran into my friend,
 <a href="http://www.spillingover.com/">Sonya</a>, who filled me in on all the details of her faith walk into adopting baby “Joy.”</p>
<p>Their paperwork was completed. They’d been approved. They’d even been matched!! (She called it being paper-pregnant)</p>
<p>Now, they just needed to stay faithful until the Lord clued them in on just how this was to be financed.</p>
<h3><span>Wallah! The answer to my, “why”. {This project would help fund her adoption.} </span></h3>
<p>I didn’t reveal God’s plan to Sonya just yet. (I still didn’t know 
how to accomplish all this). But I did drop in on Gigi (my favorite 
coffee-sharing friend) a few days later, and shared this big idea with 
her.</p>
<p>No, she had never made something like this before. No, she didn’t own
 power tools. No, she doesn’t even have one of those nifty Cricut 
machines to help make a stencil for this project.</p>
<p>But she has the Lord, too. And I asked her to pray. Little-known to 
me, she also contacted her good friend Kelli, who has made something 
like this before (many somethings like this), who did own her own power 
tools, and did have one of those nifty Cricut machines. And not only did
 she want to help me out. She made the templates free of charge!!</p>
<h3><span>Wallah! The answer to my “how.” {Others would help me get there.} </span></h3>
<p>I sanded,stained, and stenciled 10 (!!) pallets over the next few 
weeks. Two were “sold” to neighbors curious of my carport assembly line,
 seven were snatched up by friends and family online (even as far away 
as Hawaii!), and one was reserved as a surprise gift for Sonya – a 
memorial to all that the Lord knit together to bring Joy home for 
Christmas. Oh for Joy!</p>
<p>And you know what? None of it felt feverish. I gave, and no one 
scrambled. I sacrificed and no one whipped up wild dust. I danced, but 
did not take one frenzied step.</p>
<p>And you gave. Pam, Jeannine, Chris, Claire, Valerie, Mary, Betsy, Mark, Kate. You gave and helped make a life by what you give.</p>
<p>Vivian Joy landed on American soil Dec 22, 2016! And the very next 
day we presented Sonya and her family with a little extra Joy of 
Christmas.</p>
<h3>Thank you!! Thank you everyone who gave, everyone who gave away, everyone who refused to give up.</h3>
<h3>Thank you for being part of this Christmas Joy Project!</h3>
