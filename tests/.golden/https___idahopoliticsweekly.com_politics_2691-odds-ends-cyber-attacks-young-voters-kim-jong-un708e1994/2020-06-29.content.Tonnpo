<p>A few thoughts on a few, somewhat random, topics...</p>
<p>Infrastructure and Cybersecurity. The Idaho National Laboratory plays
 a major role in protecting U.S. infrastructure — power plants, utility 
systems and more — from cyber attacks. The INL has hundreds of workers 
engaged in this effort and local chatter indicates considerable numbers 
are joining the ranks. They are a key part of the shield that helps 
keeps the lights on, and water and sewer flowing in the U.S., despite 
nearly constant foreign attack from countries like Russia, China, Iran 
and North Korea.</p>
<p>A part of the sword was revealed in a New York Times story over the 
weekend. U.S. Cyber Command, a branch of the Pentagon, has apparently 
launched a series of massive strikes against Russian power facilities, 
including the insertion of malware which could be used to strike back in
 a conflict.</p>
<p>National Security Advisor John Bolton said last week that the purpose
 of such efforts were, “To say to Russia, or anybody else that’s engaged
 in cyberoperations against us, ‘You will pay a price.’”</p>
<p>Russia is believed have recently used cyber tools to cripple power 
distribution in the Ukraine. Don’t be surprised if reports start 
circulating of problems inside Russia related to utilities, with the INL
 working quietly in the background to mitigate any counterattack.</p>
<p>Idaho GOP needs to engage young voters. Because Idaho is 
overwhelmingly red, it is easy for many Idaho Republicans to believe it 
will remain so for the foreseeable future. That is a mistake. Idaho 
Democrats were competitive less than a generation ago with Cecil Andrus 
as governor and Richard Stallings, Larry LaRocco and Walt Minnick in 
Congress, and much larger numbers in the Legislature.</p>
<p>One sign of a possible turn is that Democrats dominate Ada County, both at the legislative level and on the county commission.</p>
<p>One key to the future is the youth vote. Idaho’s GOP officials may 
want to follow the sound advice of Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox (and 2020 
candidate for Utah governor) who points out that in 2018 68% of voters 
nationally under age 30 favored Democrats.</p>
<p>His solution? He told Washington County Republicans: “We have to 
explain ‘the why’ behind [conservative policies]. It’s not that we don’t
 like people, it’s actually that we do like people and we want to help 
them, and government’s just not good at it.”</p>
<p>Cox likes to speak to young audiences and is willing to take hard 
questions. His willingness to engage young voters is worthy of 
emulation.</p>
<p>Trump’s man crush on Kim Jong Un. One thing I don’t get is the 
president’s infatuation with North Korea’s brutal dictator, Kim Jong Un.
 Last week he bragged about getting a “beautiful letter” from Kim.</p>
<p class="">The man is reported to have had his uncle killed by an 
anti-aircraft gun and fed others to rabid dogs. He undoubtedly ordered 
the killing of his brother at a Malaysian airport using a nerve agent. 
And, despite Trump’s denials, he is directly responsible for the death 
of American student Otto Warmbier, who was detained in North Korea as a 
healthy young man and returned in coma, before dying.</p>
<p class="">Kim Jong Un is a class A-1 creep and the president should 
stop the charade that their friendship can curb North Koreas’s continued
 bad behavior, most recently yet another threatening missile test.</p>
