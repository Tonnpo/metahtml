<h1 class="rm-manual"><span>The Truth Behind Kim Jong Un's Alleged Plastic Surgery (and Which Family Member He Wants to Look Like Most)</span></h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span> Posted on : <a href="https://iknowallnews.com/lifestyle/truth-behind-kim-jong-uns-alleged-plastic-surgery-family-member-wants-look-like/">May 3, 2018</a> </span></p>
<p>We all know who Kim Jong Un is — and perhaps more interestingly, we 
all know what the North Korean leader looks like, too. With his steady 
diet of cheese and expensive taste in liquor, it’s no wonder experts are
 concerned for Kim’s health. And others have noticed his looks keep 
changing over the years, too.</p>
<p>Plastic surgery rumors have circulated around Kim for years — but are
 any of them true? Find out if the leader has really had any cosmetic 
alterations (page 5) and who he wants to look like the most (page 6).</p>
<h2>1. Kim Jong Un’s appearance is talked about around the world</h2>

<p>Kim doesn’t exactly look like the pinnacle of health, which concerns a
 lot of the world. It’s well-documented that Kim Jong Un loves the finer
 things in life, which includes expensive meats and his prized Emmental 
cheese. And his extreme wealth allows him to have as many of these 
luxuries as he wants.</p>
<p>What’s more troubling, however, is that many people in North Korea 
are starving. And according to some reports, Kim isn’t just spending his
 wealth on good food.</p>
<p>Next: We’re shocked by what this defector said North Koreans are fans of. </p>

<p>If you thought the plastic surgery trend in America was bad, one 
defector claims North Korea’s is even worse. Daily Express reports 
defector Kim Yoo Sung says North Koreans are getting cosmetic procedures
 done to improve their appearance. For those who can afford it, 
allegedly double-eyelid surgery is quite common to reshape the eyes, as 
is scar removal.</p>
<p>Kim Yoo Sung also says North Koreans don’t get anesthetic when 
undergoing double-eyelid surgery. And not every surgeon is qualified to 
do the job, either.</p>
<p>Next: Rumors started swirling around Kim Jong Un’s appearance when this happened.</p>
<h2>3. Kim Jong Un gained a substantial amount of weight over the years, which started rumors</h2>

<p>The BBC reports South Korea’s spy agency gave a report on Kim Jong 
Un’s weight — and they didn’t have many positive things to note. The 
National Intelligence Service claimed he went from around 200 pounds in 
2012 to around 290 pounds in 2016.</p>
<p>His diet could be a simple explanation for this, but speculation 
doesn’t stop there. Some think he purposely gained weight or got surgery
 to look larger than he really is.</p>
<p>Next: Another aspect of his health was brought to the media’s attention. </p>
<h2>4. His limp didn’t go unnoticed, either</h2>

<p>While the public noticed his weight ballooning, they also noticed 
something else — his limp. NBC News reports South Korean reporters 
commented on Kim’s troubles with walking back in 2014. This was the 
first time anyone had acknowledged the leader’s failing health.</p>
<p>Expert Michael Madden said it looked like Kim developed gout, which 
caused him to limp. Either way, it’s not the first time another country 
reported on Kim’s secret health conditions.</p>
<p>Next: You’ll never believe how many plastic surgeries this TV channel said Kim had. </p>
<h2>5. A Chinese TV channel said Kim Jong Un had 6 plastic surgery procedures</h2>

<p>One report from China shocked the world and enraged the North Korean 
leader. Business Insider says in 2013, a Chinese TV reported that a 
trusted source told them Kim had undergone plastic surgery. And he 
reportedly didn’t get just one operation, either — he got six.</p>
<p>There doesn’t seem to be much evidence to support the claim, but that
 didn’t stop public speculation. And since then, the public hasn’t 
stopped wondering what those surgeries could have been.</p>
<p>Next: Here’s who Kim Jong Un wants to look like most. </p>
<h2>6. The report says he aspires to look like his grandfather</h2>

<p>So, why would Kim go through multiple operations? The Telegraph 
reports it’s because he reportedly wants to look like as much like his 
grandfather, Kim Il Sung, as possible. Kim Il Sung is known as the 
“eternal president” of the country, so it’s no wonder the current leader
 aspires to be just like him.</p>
<p>Whether or not the plastic surgery rumors are true is still up for 
debate. But there’s no doubt that through his hair cut, clothing, and 
demeanor, he emulates his grandfather completely.</p>
<p>Next: Here’s how North Korea responded to the plastic surgery rumors. </p>
<h2>7. A North Korean news agency immediately denied the claims</h2>

<p>Kim denies the plastic surgery rumors, of course. And North Korea 
even put out a statement regarding the rumors after they surfaced, The 
Telegraph reports.</p>
<p>The Korean Central News Agency stated, “The false report … released 
by enemies is a hideous criminal act which the party, army, and people 
can never tolerate.” And Business Insider notes the Chinese media have 
since been dealt censorship orders to not “report, comment on, or 
redistribute stories about the personal lives of North Korean leaders.”</p>
<p>Next: North Korea didn’t accept a simple apology for the rumors. </p>
<h2>8. North Korea threatened South Korea after the reports came out</h2>

<p class="">As expected, Kim didn’t take the rumors lightly. Daily 
Express reports the Korean Central News Agency said the report “released
 by enemies” was a “hideous criminal act.” They also said, “Those 
hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the nation should not 
expect any mercy or leniency” and that the “human scum and media” 
perpetuating the rumors “will have to pay.”</p>
<p>It seems neither South Korea or China were retaliated against for the
 rumors after all. But they’ll think twice next time before commenting 
on Kim’s looks.</p>
