<p class="rm-manual"> <span> Posted on : <a href="https://iknowallnews.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-sent-two-decoy-planes-singapore-summit-amid-assassination-fears-donald-trump-snipers-car-boots/">June 11, 2018</a> </span></p>
<p>The two leaders fear being assassinated so much they've a small army 
dedicated to keeping them alive as they meet face-to-face in a bid to 
avert nuclear war.</p>
<p>Kim is reportedly terrified he will be assassinated while overseas on
 what will be his longest ever trip abroad as North Korean leader.</p>
<p>As he arrived, it transpired crafty Kim used two decoy jets, 
including his outdated Soviet-era Ilyushin-62 dubbed Air Force Un, which
 flew from Pyongyang to the south-east Asian city state.</p>
<p><span>And after slyly touching down in a third plane in Changi 
Airport last night, the pint-sized despot was ushered into a waiting 
black Mercedes.</span></p>
<p><span>His infamous suit-clad security detail was then spring into action, with f</span>ootage showing the minders keeping pace with Kim’s official car.</p>
<p>Tellingly the 20-vehicle convoy included an ambulance.</p>
<p>But it was not just Kim fears assassination.</p>
<p>Trump has a crack team of secret service agents protecting him where ever he goes.</p>
<p><span>At the swanky Shangri-La Hotel, Secret Service officers were seen huddling in preparation for the President's movements.</span></p>
<p>Trump and the North Korean leader will meet at the five-star Capella 
Hotel on the island of Sentosa on Tuesday to discuss the rogue state’s 
nuclear weapons programme.</p>
<p>The meeting will be the first time a sitting US President has met with a member of the Kim dynasty.</p>
<p>Around a dozen delegates from the rogue state – many of whom looked 
to be of fighting aged in their 20s – were also seen getting off a bus 
before the crunch nuclear talks.</p>
<p>Before flying out to south-east Asia, Trump said he was on a "peace 
mission" while insisting he will know if he can strike a deal with the 
dictator “within the first minute” of their meeting.</p>
<p>The brash New Yorker flew to Singapore last night to prepare for the showdown summit.</p>
<p>As he left the G7 summit in Canada, Trump called on the diminutive 
despot to seize on his “one-time shot” to make history and agree to 
disarm in exchange for economic prosperity.</p>
<p>Boasting of his deal making prowess, the US President insisted on the
 chances of success: “I’ll know within the first minute. My touch, my 
feel, that’s what I do.</p>
<p>“You know how they say you know whether you’re going to like someone in the first five seconds?</p>
<p>“Very quickly I think I’ll know if something positive is going to happen”.</p>
<p>After a choppy run up to their meeting, Republican firebrand refused 
to put odds on the chances of winning a peace deal for North Korea to 
disarm.</p>
<p>He explained: “There has not been done before. Very little is known 
about him, but I think he is going to surprise on the upside.</p>
<p>“We’re going in with a very positive attitude, and I think it will be fine.</p>
<p>But who knows? Maybe it won’t work out.</p>
<p>“But at the minimum, but at least we would have met each other.”</p>
<p>Despite agreeing to the summit, Kim is still widely believed to think
 the US has a "hostile policy" against him and would welcome a regime 
change.</p>
<p>There have also been reports of countries, including China, looking into ways of removing the leader by force.</p>
<p>Trump expressed his desire to invite the North Korean leader to the 
White House if the meeting at the £8,000-a-night luxury resort in 
Singapore goes smoothly.</p>
<p>The former reality TV star, 71, said he would prefer to welcome Kim 
to the White House over his luxury Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, 
Florida.</p>
<p>"Maybe we'll start with the White House," he told reporters at a press conference alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p>
