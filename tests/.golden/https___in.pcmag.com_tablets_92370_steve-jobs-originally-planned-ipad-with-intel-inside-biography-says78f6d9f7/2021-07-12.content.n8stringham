<h1 class="rm-manual">Steve Jobs Originally Planned iPad With Intel Inside, Biography Says</h1>
<address class="rm-manual"> <span>By Peter Pachal</span> </address>
<p class="rm-manual"> Oct. 26, 2011, 10:29 p.m. </p>
<p>Although Apple gets chips for its entire Mac lineup from Intel, <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395195,00.asp">Steve Jobs</a> had issues with the company, Walter Isaacson reveals in <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395246,00.asp">his biography</a>
 of the former Apple CEO. Jobs thought Intel was a company that was slow
 to adapt, although at one point Jobs had considered using Intel 
technology in the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>Apple made the high-profile switch to Intel chips in the middle of 
the last decade after a long period of using IBM's and Motorola's 
PowerPC processors. Intel now powers all the desktops and laptops Apple 
makes. And if things had been different, it might be in Apple's iOS 
devices, too.</p>
<p>In the early days of the partnership, Isaacson writes, Jobs had plans
 to power the iPad with an Intel Atom chip, even though one of his key 
executives, Tony Fadell (who helped create the iPod and went on to found
 a company that just announced a <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395108,00.asp">high-tech thermostat</a>)
 thought Apple should go with a processor based on the ARM architecture,
 the low-power design that's the basis of almost every chip in cell 
phones and tablets today.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="file:///desktop/41787/gallery/the-greatest-victories-of-steve-jobs">View all Photos in Gallery</a></p>
<p>"At the high-performance end, Intel is the best," Jobs said. "At the 
beginning, we were doing wonderful things together. They wanted this big
 joint project to do chips for future iPhones."</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, Fadell's point of view won out. Apple acquired a 
couple of chip companies, PA Semi and Intrinsity, and created its own 
chips, the A4 and later A5. Jobs explains why he didn't go with Intel 
for the iPad and iPhone in the book.</p>
<p>"There were two reasons we did not go with them" he said. "One was 
that they are just really slow. They are like a steamship, not very 
flexible. We are used to going pretty fast. Second is that we just did 
not want to teach them everything, which they could go and sell to our 
competitors,"</p>
<p>Jobs also voiced other criticisms. He said Intel's "graphics suck" 
and that its processors don't have the same system-on-a-chip 
efficiencies of the A4/A5. It's not known if the interview was conducted
 before the most recent refresh of the MacBook Air, which switched from 
Nvidia graphics to Intel and include Intel's energy-efficient "Sandy 
Bridge" processors. Intel also has plans to expand its system-on-a-chip 
offerings, including designs for <a href="http://in.pcmag.com/news/26327/next-generation-of-windows-will-run-on-arm">Windows 8</a>.</p>
<p>Isaacson goes on to quote Intel CEO Paul Otellini, who says part of 
the reason Intel did not appear on the iPad was because the companies 
could not agree on pricing, and because Jobs wanted too much control 
over the final design of the iPad chip.</p>
