<p class="rm-manual">By: <a href="file:///agency/ap/">AP</a> | Shah Alam | <span> Published: October 2, 2017 8:10:01 am </span> </p>
<p><span> North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, left and his exiled half brother Kim Jong Nam, right. (Source: AP)</span> </p>
<p>Two women accused of killing the half brother of North Korea’s leader
 plead not guilty as trial begins in Malaysia. They were accused of 
poisoning the estranged half brother of North Korea’s ruler arrived for 
the beginning of their trial Monday in Malaysia’s High Court, nearly 
eight months after the brazen airport assassination. Siti Aisyah of 
Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam are suspected of smearing Kim 
Jong Nam’s face with the banned VX nerve agent on Feb. 13 at a crowded 
airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur, killing him within about 20 minutes. 
The women say they thought they were playing a harmless prank for a 
hidden-camera show.</p>
<p>The women are the only suspects in custody in a killing that South 
Korea’s spy agency said was part of a five-year plot by North Korean 
leader Kim Jong Un to kill a brother he reportedly never met. Police say
 several North Koreans suspected of involvement left the country on the 
day of the attack and others were allowed to leave later in a diplomatic
 deal with Pyongyang.</p>
<p>The two women, who face the death penalty if convicted, will plead 
not guilty, their lawyers said. District Assistant Commissioner of 
Police Shafien Mamat confirmed that both suspects arrived at the court 
Monday morning.</p>
<p>Prosecutors will then start to call their witnesses, with the first 
few likely to be medical experts to establish the cause of death, said 
Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, Huong’s lawyer. The trial is expected to last for 
about two months, after which the judge will decide if there is a strong
 case for the women to have to mount their defense, Teh said.</p>
<p>Kim, who was 45 or 46, was the eldest son of the family that has 
ruled North Korea since its founding, yet he reportedly fell out of 
favor in 2001 when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false 
passport, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He had been living
 abroad for years and at the time of his death was traveling on a North 
Korean diplomatic passport under the name “Kim Chol.”</p>
<p>North Korea has a long history of ordering killings of people it 
views as threats to its regime, though Kim was not thought to be seeking
 influence over his younger brother. He had, however, spoken out 
publicly against his family’s dynastic control of the reclusive, 
nuclear-armed nation.</p>
<p>Pyongyang has denied any role in the killing and has not even 
acknowledged the dead man was Kim Jong Nam. It has suggested the victim 
died of a heart attack and accused Malaysia of working with South Korean
 and other “hostile forces” in blaming Pyongyang.</p>
<p>The trial will be closely watched by the Indonesian and Vietnamese governments, which have hired lawyers to defend the women.</p>
<p>Aisyah’s core defense will be that she didn’t know she had poison on 
her hand when she smeared Kim’s face and was instead the victim of an 
elaborate trick, her lawyer Gooi Soon Seng said. The 25-year-old was at a
 pub in Kuala Lumpur in early January when she was recruited by a North 
Korean man to star in what he said were video prank shows, Gooi said.</p>
<p>Over the course of several days, the North Korean, who went by the 
name James, had Aisyah go out to malls, hotels and airports and rub oil 
or pepper sauce on strangers, which he would film on his phone, the 
lawyer said.</p>
<p>Aisyah was paid $100-$200 for each prank and hoped the income would allow her to stop working as an escort, Gooi said.</p>
<p>In late January, Aisyah flew to Cambodia, where James introduced her 
to a man called Chang, who said he was the producer of video prank shows
 for the Chinese market, the lawyer said. Back in Malaysia, Chang asked 
Aisyah to do several more pranks at the Kuala Lumpur airport a few days 
before Kim was attacked. At the airport on the day of Kim’s death, Chang
 pointed him out to Aisyah as the next target and put the poison on her 
hand, the lawyer said.</p>
<p>Police say neither Chang nor James were who they say they were. Chang
 was actually Hong Song Hac, one of four North Korean suspects who left 
Malaysia on the day of the killing, while James was Ri Ji U, one of 
another three North Koreans who hid inside their country’s embassy in 
Kuala Lumpur to avoid questioning.</p>
<p>Those three were later allowed to fly home in exchange for nine 
Malaysians allowed to leave Pyongyang in a deal easing the countries’ 
diplomatic tensions. Gooi said James was key to Aisyah’s defense and 
that his absence could weaken her case.</p>
<p>Aisyah, who has a son, has wrote to her family and told them to pray 
for her “so that the case will be over soon and I can go back home.”</p>
<p>The 29-year-old Vietnamese suspect Huong was caught on airport 
security surveillance camera wearing a white sweatshirt emblazoned with 
the big black letters “LOL” _ the acronym for laughing out loud. Little 
is known about her. Raised in a rice farm in northern Vietnam, her 
family said they had hardly heard from her since she left home a decade 
ago.</p>
<p>She made postings on a <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/">Facebook</a> page under the name Ruby Ruby, according to her niece, Dinh Thi Quyen.</p>
<p>Photos on the page show Huong wearing a white shirt that says “LOL,” 
like the one seen during the attack. It shows her posing for selfies in 
January in Cambodia and in Kuala Lumpur a few days before the attack.</p>
<p>Her last post was on the morning of Feb. 11, two days before the attack, from an area near the airport.</p>
