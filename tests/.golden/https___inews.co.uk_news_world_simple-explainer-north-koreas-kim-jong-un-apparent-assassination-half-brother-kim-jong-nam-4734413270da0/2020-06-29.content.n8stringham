 Jong-nam, the older, estranged half brother of North Korean leader Kim 
Jong-un, has died in an apparent assassination in Malaysia.</p>
<p>The common theory – although speculation at this point – is that the 
death of the known gambler and critic of his brother’s leadership was 
ordered by North Korea.</p>
<p>Why he was killed remains the big question, although some analysts 
have suggested that Kim Jong-un was paranoid and maybe even feared for 
his life.</p>

<p>A number of people have been arrested in connection with the death, 
and Malaysian authorities have now said they will charge two women with 
his murder.</p>
<p>How Kim Jong-nam died</p>
<p>The 45 or 46-year-old, travelling under the name of Kim Chol, fell 
ill at the airport in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur on Monday 
morning while waiting for his flight back to Macau, where he lived. He 
died on his way to hospital.</p>
<p>It is believed that he was poisoned.</p>
<p>Two women wiped the deadly nerve agent VX on his face. The toxin had 
been placed on their hands by North Koreans, according to authorities.</p>
<p>CCTV footage, obtained by Japanese television, purports to show two women approach Kim Jong-nam at the airport.</p>
<p>Do we know who did it?</p>
<p>The women believed they were part of a prank show, according to authorities.</p>
<p>Following the attack, Malaysian police arrested a number of people 
including a woman called Doan Thi Huong – she was carrying Vietnamese 
travel documents and was spotted on CCTV in a top with the letters “LOL”
 – and Siti Aisyah, who had an Indonesian passport.</p>
<p>These two women have now been accused of murder and could face the death sentence if they are convicted.</p>
<p>Two other suspects, one of whom is North Korean, remain in custody. 
Authorities are still looking for seven other North Korean suspects.</p>
<p>Four of the North Koreans suspected are spies from the country’s Ministry of State Security, according to South Korea.</p>
<figcaption>The CCTV image of the first woman arrested after the death of Kim Jong-nam</figcaption><p>Why is it considered to be an assassination?</p>
<p>Officials from South Korea and the US have said the killing was probably carried out by North Korean agents.</p>
<p>North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un, 33, has form. He ordered the 
execution of his uncle Jang Sung-taek – considered by the leader to be a
 traitor – in 2013. “If he did his uncle, he could surely do his 
brother,” says self-confessed Korea-watcher and honorary fellow at the 
University of Leeds Aidan Foster-Carter.</p>
<p>He has also ordered the execution of government officials.</p>
<p>The spy service in South Korea has alleged that North Korea had been 
trying to kill Kim Jong-nam for five years, leading the latter to 
reportedly plead for his life in a letter to his brother.</p>
<p>So the order came from the top?</p>
<p>If indeed Kim Jong-nam was assassinated, then it most likely came 
from the top of the North Korean government – although this has not been
 proven.</p>
<p>“This high-tech, lurid, James Bondish [killing], that suggests to me to be the power of the state,” says Mr Foster-Carter.</p>
<p>The apparent assassination “is the latest in a series of purges from 
within the North Korean elite”, says Dr Markus Bell, a lecturer at 
Sheffield University’s School of East Asian Studies.</p>
<p>“Kim Jong-nam hadn’t expressed a desire to lead the DPRK, but 
nevertheless was likely viewed as a loose thread by his younger 
brother.”</p>
<p>What was the relationship like between the two brothers?</p>
<p>Kim Jong-nam was estranged and living in Macau, an autonomous region 
on the south coast of China. He has claimed to have never met Kim 
Jong-un.</p>
<p>He was by-passed to become leader of North Korea when his father Kim 
Jong-il died, with the line of succession moving to his younger half 
brother.</p>
<figcaption>Former North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il with his son, Kim Jong-Nam (Getty)</figcaption><p>This
 was possibly because of the embarrassment he had caused the family, 
such as in 2001, when he tried to enter Japan, to visit Tokyo 
Disneyland, with a false passport.</p>
<p>He had also criticised his family’s control in North Korea and Kim Jong-un’s leadership.</p>
<p>What could the motive be?</p>
<p>This remains unknown.</p>
<p>There is also a dividing view of whether the apparent assassination 
can “be understood as a display of Kim Jong-un’s tightening grip on 
power or conversely, as symbolic of the young leader’s struggle for 
stability,” says Dr Bell.</p>
<p>But it could be that Kim Jong-un was paranoid, according to Mr Foster-Carter.</p>
<p><span>“It was quite often suggested that if China wanted someone more
 pliant and pliable in charge of North Korea – because of course China 
doesn’t want North Korea to collapse, they want it as a buffer state, 
but they would like it to be less annoying with all the missile tests – 
Kim Jong-nam is on the record for favouring reform… That would be great 
for China.</span></p>
<p><span>“It is all speculative, this slightly shambling, slightly 
low-life figure, whether he could ever have been a plausible substitute 
for his brother. Who knows, but maybe the brother was afraid of that,” 
he says. </span></p>
<p>The apparent assassination could have been an attempt to ensure 
“rival factions inside the North Korean elite wouldn’t have another Kim 
to rally around, and heading off possible China-backed leadership 
challenges,” adds Dr Bell.</p>
<p>Any other theories floating about?</p>
<p>Kim Jong-nam was most well-known around 2012, when a book – written 
by Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi – containing quotes of him criticising 
his brother was released.</p>
<p>Since then he has “gone to ground” so there is a theory that some 
agents orchestrated the assassination to get Kim Jong-un’s approval, 
says Mr Foster-Carter, emphasising that this is highly speculative 
though.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-nam, quoted in the 2012 book:</p>
<p>“I’m concerned how Jong Un, who merely resembles my grandfather, will be able to satisfy the needs of <span>North</span> <span>Korea</span>ns.
 Kim Jong Un is still just a nominal figure and the members of the power
 elite will be the ones in actual power. The dynastic succession is a 
joke to the outside world.”</p>
<p>Other motives, again highly speculative, could be linked to the life led by Kim Jong-nam.</p>
<p>He had a “complicated love life” so the arrested woman could have been a jilted lover, offers Mr Foster-Carter.</p>
<p>The gambler could have been involved in a shady business deal, he 
adds. He had presumably been cut off financially from North Korea so the
 state of his finances is unknown.</p>
<figcaption>If Kim Jong-nam was assassinated, it shows the brutality of the North Korean regime (AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption><p>What does the apparent assassination tell us about North Korea?</p>
<p><span>“It tells us that North Korea is a very brutal regime,” says Mr
 Foster-Carter. “It may tell us the leader of North Korea is rather 
paranoid and is afraid for his life.”</span></p>
<p>The assassination is being viewed as a warning to other would-be 
defectors from North Korea’s political elite, according to Dr Bell. “It 
sends a clear message: wherever you are, whoever you are, we can get to 
you.”</p>
<p>Assume there’s an investigation going on?</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities have been conducting an investigation, much to the irritation of North Korea.</p>
<p>“The investigation by the Malaysian police is not for the 
clarification of the cause of the death and search for the suspect, but 
it is out of the political aim,” Kang Cho, North Korea’s ambassador to 
Kuala Lumpur, has said previously.</p>
<p>The suspicion had been “pinned” on North Korea, he added, calling for
 a joint investigation. But Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said 
authorities had been objective in their work.</p>
<p>A delegation from North Korean have arrived in Kuala Lumpur seeking 
the body of Kim Jong-nam but Malaysian authorities have so far refused 
to release the body.</p>
