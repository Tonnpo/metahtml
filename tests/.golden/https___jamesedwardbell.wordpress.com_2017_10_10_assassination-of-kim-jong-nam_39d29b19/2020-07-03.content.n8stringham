<figcaption class="rm-manual">Photo from CNN.com</figcaption><p>I just recently read an article on <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chemist-kim-14-times-lethal-dosage-vx-face-50383012">abcnews.go.com </a>,
 about the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of North 
Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a Malaysian airport. Two Vietnamese women 
attacked Kim with VX Nerve Agent on their hands and clothing effectively
 administering a lethal enough dose to prove fatal.</p>
<p>It was very surprising to me that the article stated that experts 
believe that the murder could somehow be connected to Kim Jong Un 
feeling that his rule was threatened, and that the lawyers of the two 
females claim that they believed they were tricked by North Korean 
Agents and told they were performing a prank on a Hidden Camera TV show.</p>
<p>News outlet, <a href="https://twitter.com/malaysiandigest">Malaysian Digest</a> recently tweeted about the beginning of the murder trial for the two women.</p>
<p>These women face the death penalty if convicted, so if there is foul 
play by the North Korean government involved their defense lawyer will 
have to build a strong case. My reflection on the case so far is that 
they will have a difficult time doing this because of airport footage 
that appears to show them “practicing” 2 days before the murder.</p>
<p>I remember briefly hearing about the assassination in February when 
it occurred, but did not know about the possible involvement of North 
Korean Agents and Kim Jong Un, or that Kim Jong Nam was estranged to the
 rest of the family. My interest was now peaked with the possibility of 
the murder possibly being a set up.</p>
<p>This article for me provided an update on the case, and describe in 
detail how Kim had 1.4 times the lethal dosage on his face according to 
Raja Subramaniam who is the head of the Center of Chemical Weapons 
Analysis in Malaysia. As the trial develops I hope to stay informed and 
see what the court decides.</p>
