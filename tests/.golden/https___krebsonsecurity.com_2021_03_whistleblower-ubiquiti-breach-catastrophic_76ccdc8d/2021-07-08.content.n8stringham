<p>On Jan. 11, <a href="https://www.ui.com/" rel="noopener">Ubiquiti Inc.</a>
 [NYSE:UI] — a major vendor of cloud-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) 
devices such as routers, network video recorders and security cameras — 
disclosed that a breach involving a third-party cloud provider had 
exposed customer account credentials. Now a source who participated in 
the response to that breach alleges Ubiquiti massively downplayed a 
“catastrophic” incident to minimize the hit to its stock price, and that
 the third-party cloud provider claim was a fabrication.</p>
<p>A security professional at Ubiquiti who helped the company respond to
 the two-month breach beginning in December 2020 contacted 
KrebsOnSecurity after raising his concerns with both Ubiquiti’s 
whistleblower hotline and with European data protection authorities. The
 source — we’ll call him Adam — spoke on condition of anonymity for fear
 of retribution by Ubiquiti.</p>
<p>“It was catastrophically worse than reported, and legal silenced and 
overruled efforts to decisively protect customers,” Adam wrote in a 
letter to the European Data Protection Supervisor. “The breach was 
massive, customer data was at risk, access to customers’ devices 
deployed in corporations and homes around the world was at risk.”</p>
<p>Ubiquiti has not responded to repeated requests for comment.</p>
<p> Update, Mar. 31, 6:58 p.m. ET: In <a href="https://community.ui.com/questions/Update-to-January-2021-Account-Notification/3813e6f4-b023-4d62-9e10-1035dc51ad2e" rel="noopener">a post to its user forum</a>,
 Ubiquiti said its security experts identified “no evidence that 
customer information was accessed, or even targeted.” Ubiquiti can say 
this, says Adam, because it failed to keep records of which accounts 
were accessing that data. We’ll hear more about this from Adam in a bit.</p>
<p>Original story:</p>
<p>According to Adam, the hackers obtained full read/write access to 
Ubiquiti databases at Amazon Web Services (AWS), which was the alleged 
“third party” involved in the breach. Ubiquiti’s breach disclosure, he 
wrote, was “downplayed and purposefully written to imply that a 3rd 
party cloud vendor was at risk and that Ubiquiti was merely a casualty 
of that, instead of the target of the attack.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/ubiquiti-change-your-password-enable-2fa/" rel="noopener">its Jan. 11 public notice</a>,
 Ubiquiti said it became aware of “unauthorized access to certain of our
 information technology systems hosted by a third party cloud provider,”
 although it declined to name the third party.</p>
<p>In reality, Adam said, the attackers had gained administrative access
 to Ubiquiti’s servers at Amazon’s cloud service, which secures the 
underlying server hardware and software but requires the cloud tenant 
(client) to secure access to any data stored there.</p>
<p>“They were able to get cryptographic secrets for single sign-on 
cookies and remote access, full source code control contents, and 
signing keys exfiltration,” Adam said.</p>
<p>Adam says the attacker(s) had access to privileged credentials that were previously stored in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LastPass" rel="noopener">LastPass</a>
 account of a Ubiquiti IT employee, and gained root administrator access
 to all Ubiquiti AWS accounts, including all S3 data buckets, all 
application logs, all databases, all user database credentials, and 
secrets required to forge single sign-on (SSO) cookies.</p>
<p>Such access could have allowed the intruders to remotely authenticate
 to countless Ubiquiti cloud-based devices around the world. According 
to its website, Ubiquiti has shipped more than 85 million devices that 
play a key role in networking infrastructure in over 200 countries and 
territories worldwide.</p>
<p>Adam says Ubiquiti’s security team picked up signals in late December
 2020 that someone with administrative access had set up several Linux 
virtual machines that weren’t accounted for.</p>
<p>Then they found a backdoor that an intruder had left behind in the system.</p>
<p>When security engineers removed the backdoor account in the first week of January, <span>the
 intruders responded by sending a message saying they wanted 50 bitcoin 
(~$2.8 million USD) in exchange for a promise to remain quiet about the 
breach.</span> The attackers also provided proof they’d stolen 
Ubiquiti’s source code, and pledged to disclose the location of another 
backdoor if their ransom demand was met.</p>
<p>Ubiquiti did not engage with the hackers, Adam said, and ultimately 
the incident response team found the second backdoor the extortionists 
had left in the system. The company would spend the next few days 
furiously rotating credentials for all employees, before Ubiquiti 
started alerting customers about the need to reset their passwords.</p>
<p>But he maintains that instead of asking customers to change their 
passwords when they next log on — as the company did on Jan. 11 — 
Ubiquiti should have immediately invalidated all of its customer’s 
credentials and forced a reset on all accounts, mainly because the 
intruders already had credentials needed to remotely access customer IoT
 systems.</p>
<p>“Ubiquiti had negligent logging (no access logging on databases) so 
it was unable to prove or disprove what they accessed, but the attacker 
targeted the credentials to the databases, and created Linux instances 
with networking connectivity to said databases,” Adam wrote in his 
letter. “Legal overrode the repeated requests to force rotation of all 
customer credentials, and to revert any device access permission changes
 within the relevant period.”</p>
<p>If you have Ubiquiti devices installed and haven’t yet changed the 
passwords on the devices since Jan. 11 this year, now would be a good 
time to take care of that.</p>
<p>It might also be a good idea to just delete any profiles you had on 
these devices, make sure they’re up to date on the latest firmware, and 
then re-create those profiles with new [and preferably unique] 
credentials. And seriously consider disabling any remote access on the 
devices.</p>
<p>Ubiquiti’s stock price has grown remarkably since the company’s 
breach disclosure Jan. 16. After a brief dip following the news, 
Ubiquiti’s shares have surged from $243 on Jan. 13 to $370 as of today. 
By market close Tuesday, UI had slipped to $349. Update, Apr. 1: 
Ubiquiti’s stock opened down almost 15 percent Wednesday; as of Thursday
 morning it was trading at $298.</p>

 two factor auth is crap. it doesn’t allow you to change your phone. it 
should be assigned to a phone number, not a phone. after i changed my

 the 2 factor auth method ubiquiti uses is the open “Time-Based One-Time
 Password Algorithm” described in RFC 6238, which is implemented in the 
most common 2FA apps (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator), 
and used widely by service providers, including facebook, amazon, the 
google, paypal, and microsoft, to name only a few big’uns.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 central idea here is that it *must* be impossible to perform 2FA 
without the one phone that contains the secret key shared by you and the
 provider.</p> <p class="rm-manual">When a user registers 2FA at 
ubiquiti, they are given the opportunity to save 10 one-use passcodes 
that can be used to authenticate if the “one phone” is lost or 
unavailable, allowing 2FA to be moved to a new device if desired. </p> <p class="rm-manual">It’s
 a good idea to get those passcodes and save them somewhere 
safe–electronically in a secure password manager, or on paper in a 
secure location–so that a damaged or missing phone is not a denial of 
service attack.</p> </section> </article> <ol class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> Yyz <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/comment-page-2/#comment-530968">April 1, 2021</a> <section class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual">Or use Authy instead of Google or Microsoft Authenticator apps.

 and business people obviously have an obligation to customers that 
entrust them with their security – but they also need to ensure the 
survivability of the company and ultimately they are responsible if a 
company fails. When there are downturns in business, they are the ones 
that have to make the decisions to lay people off. For the vast majority
 of attorneys and business leaders, these are actually terrible 
decisions to make. Nobody wants to be in that position.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Something
 you need to understand about situations like this is that doing the 
right thing is not as easy as complying with the law 100% or protecting 
customers at all costs. I’m sure this will be really controversial, but 
please, read my basic explanation and seek to understand. It’s a 
situation of the lesser of multiple evils. Sometimes, business 
leaders/lawyers are faced with a situation were there is no good 
decision to make – all paths will have negative consequences, and you 
need to choose the path (based on risk, impact, etc.) that will probably
 have the least negative consequences. These decisions are a very 
complex combination of risks. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Part of the 
decision as it relates to compliance is to factor in the probability and
 impact of any noncompliance. That doesn’t sound right, but it’s a 
product of being a business, not a product of bad humanity. That’s why 
compliance requirements have specific consequences for noncompliance. 
It’s why GDPR has set such outrageous fines for noncompliance – because 
they know (yes, even in the EU) that businesses have to factor in the 
consequences of noncompliance in their decisions.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Since
 Adam has apparently contacted the EU DPB about this, let’s go into more
 detail on the risk to the privacy of Ubiquiti’s customers. Under GDPR, 
not all breaches have to be reported (really). A breach only needs to be
 reported if there is a high likelihood of a serious risk to the 
privacy/rights/security of an individual. In this specific case, what 
information did Ubiquiti’s lawyers and business leaders have to support 
the probability of serious risk to its customers? And whose 
responsibility was it to collect that information? Most likely, it was 
IT that should have set up and enabled logging on the data that was 
accessed (seriously, this is not a C-Suite decision, this is a much 
lower-level decision). But because IT did NOT configure their systems to
 create these types of logs, the business leaders didn’t have crap to go
 on. They literally had no credible information to support a position 
that any specific customers’ data was actually accessed. It could have 
been, and we can speculate about this all day, but unless we see hard 
data appear on the dark web, nobody will have any information to support
 their position. In the absence of this info, the only thing we can 
conclude is that IT was not able to provide the business leaders with 
any information to support a claim that individuals’ information was 
actually compromised. And that’s part of what makes this a very terrible
 decision for the business leaders to have to make. They have to weigh 
the impact of very severe consequences to their company (and their 
employees) against the *potential* impact to their customers. So do you 
see how this ended up playing out the way it did at Ubiquiti?</p> <p class="rm-manual">Take
 this another step further. We know there was an extortion attempt after
 the hacker realized they had been discovered, right? If the attacker 
really had the keys to the kingdom and had exfiltrated all of their 
customers’ information and could take down all of their customers 
networks, they wouldn’t have stopped with a single ransom demand, would 
they? No. No way.</p><p class="rm-manual"> At the very least, the 
attacker would start posting bits of information on the dark web to 
support their claim and pursue the ransom demand, or else sell that 
information on the dark web to get some value from it. I haven’t heard 
any indications of that, and it’s been almost three months since that 
initial extortion attempt. What does that tell you?</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">My
 bet is that this breach is probably going to play out to be a big 
nothingburger. Otherwise, something else would have already happened by 
now.</p> </section> </article> <ol class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> JamminJ <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/comment-page-2/#comment-531097">April 2, 2021</a> <section class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual">That right there is a great nuanced analysis, and I can attest is VERY accurate in medium/large corporate environments.</p> <p class="rm-manual">People

 agree with most of what you say, including that it seems unlikely that 
they exfiltrated customer credentials if we haven’t seen evidence of it 
by now. However, if what the WB says is true—AWS root credentials and no
 internal logging—then Legal took a huge bet and dodged a bullet, and I 
would consider them grossly negligent. As a networking company, there 
needs to be a high bar for security, and the CTO or CISO needs to push 
back on Legal (who don’t understand what AWS root actually means) and 
tell them that this is a reputation destroying event for a company that 
made their bones on making high quality prosumer gear whose rise to 
prominence was driven by alpha geeks.</p> </section> </article> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> TenYearTexan <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/comment-page-2/#comment-531229">April 5, 2021</a> <section class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual">I
 see some nuance in Jhon’s response (the main benefit being to point out
 that not every intrusion is successful and it doesn’t serve anyone to 
take drastic actions until there is reason to believe major damage was 
done. cry wolf etc). </p> <p class="rm-manual">I still view the actions 
of Ubiquiti with some anger. Laws are in place to force people to take 
actions that go against the innate motivations of self-preservation and 
profit. The fact that there was other operational mistakes (no logging, 
no IDM, no stored data encryption, inadequate segmentation of 
information etc) which prevents the company from properly evaluating the
 risk should mean that they default to assuming a larger risk for their 
customers, not hoping it’s a small risk and waiting to see severe damage
 before warning other customers of such damage. (hurricane warnings, 
hit-n-run laws are the examples I’d reach for). </p> <p class="rm-manual">I
 don’t know the details of the GPDR law. If it was well-written, it will
 include allow flexibility to cover companies large and small for 
intrusions large and small, but the point of the legislation is to force
 companies to promptly and clearly inform the public if there is any 
risk of major loss. From the details shared, there IS such a risk. The 
coy press release in my view was an attempt to shift blame to a third 
party for multiple Ubiquiti operational failures and an obfuscation of 
the true potential threat. Secondly, the public and the law don’t care 
about who and how departments failed – the company as a whole bears the 
responsibility. I love Ubiquiti gear – cheaper and more functional than 
competitors IMHO, but I hope that they are penalized for their 
inadequate response (poor legal team decisions imho). </p> <p class="rm-manual">(BTW,
 I appreciate devils-advocate posts like Jhon’s to encourage 
intellectual and not emotional reactions. As background for good 
internal processes, such info is great, but these points don’t change my
 mind on liability and crisis response in this situation).</p> </section> </article> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> Mike <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/comment-page-2/#comment-530990">April 1, 2021</a> <section class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual">Lol,

keys, but if your device was already compromised, a clever adversary 
could simply make sure the device appeared as being updated, and never 
really install the new firmware. Alternatively; modify the new firmware 
to inject a backdoor, and skip the signature verification process. Just 
about anything is possible once they’re in your firmware.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Perhaps
 such an approach could be done even without compromising the update 
servers. If your controller has remote mgmt enabled, I wonder if an 
adversary would be possible to connect to it, and have it download 
updated firmware from a non-official feed, but signed with the official 
keys.</p> </section> </article> </li> </ol> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> Adrian <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/comment-page-2/#comment-531210">April 5, 2021</a> <section class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual">Here

 “Ubiquiti had negligent logging (no access logging on databases) so it 
was unable to prove or disprove what they accessed, but the attacker 
targeted the credentials to the databases, and created Linux instances 
with networking connectivity to said databases,” Adam wrote in his 
letter. “Legal overrode the repeated requests to force rotation of all 
customer credentials, and to revert any device access permission changes
 within the relevant period.”</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">negligent
 logging on databases -&gt; unable to prove or disprove what they 
accessed with the implication that Ubiquiti leveraged this fact to 
indicate they had no proof of access, but access could be reasonably 
assumed SO Adam thinks at this point customers should be instructed to 
change passwords, HOWEVER, Ubiquiti was ALSO aware of a second, but not 
yet discovered, back door</p> <p class="rm-manual">Does it really make sense then to change passwords WHILE the probability of a second, unclosed backdoor exists?</p><p class="rm-manual">
 I feel it makes more sense to send the password change notification 
after the door was closed AND/OR after internal employees reset their 
passwords</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">Otherwise the newly changed customer passwords would ALSO be compromised.</p> <p class="rm-manual">What is the timing of the second back door being closed/internal passwords changed as related to the customer bulletin?</p> </section> </article> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> me <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/comment-page-2/#comment-531351">April 7, 2021</a> <section class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual">use Ligowave</p> </section> </article> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> Ron <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/comment-page-2/#comment-531392">April 8, 2021</a> <section class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual">Is

 we informed you on January 11, we were the victim of a cybersecurity 
incident that involved unauthorized access to our IT systems. Given the 
reporting by Brian Krebs, there is newfound interest and attention in 
this matter, and we would like to provide our community with more 
information.</p> <p class="rm-manual">At the outset, please note that 
nothing has changed with respect to our analysis of customer data and 
the security of our products since our notification on January 11. In 
response to this incident, we leveraged external incident response 
experts to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure the attacker was 
locked out of our systems. </p> <p class="rm-manual">These experts 
identified no evidence that customer information was accessed, or even 
targeted. The attacker, who unsuccessfully attempted to extort the 
company by threatening to release stolen source code and specific IT 
credentials, never claimed to have accessed any customer information. 
This, along with other evidence, is why we believe that customer data 
was not the target of, or otherwise accessed in connection with, the 
incident.</p> <p class="rm-manual">At this point, we have well-developed
 evidence that the perpetrator is an individual with intricate knowledge
 of our cloud infrastructure. As we are cooperating with law enforcement
 in an ongoing investigation, we cannot comment further.</p> <p class="rm-manual">All
 this said, as a precaution, we still encourage you to change your 
password if you have not already done so, including on any website where
 you use the same user ID or password. We also encourage you to enable 
two-factor authentication on your Ubiquiti accounts if you have not 
already done so.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Thanks,</p> <p class="rm-manual">Team UI”</p> </section> </article> </li> </ol>
