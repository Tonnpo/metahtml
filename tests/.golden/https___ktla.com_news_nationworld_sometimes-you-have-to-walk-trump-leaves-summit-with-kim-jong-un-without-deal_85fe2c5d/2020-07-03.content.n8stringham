<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/vietnam-summit-donald-trump-kim-jong-un/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Donald Trump’s Hanoi summit with Kim Jong Un</a>,
 meant to demonstrate his diplomatic gamble with North Korea is working,
 instead ended with no joint agreement after Kim insisted all US 
sanctions be lifted on his country. That was a bridge too far for the US
 President, who said Kim offered to take some steps toward dismantling 
his nuclear arsenal but not enough to warrant ending the debilitating 
sanctions regime on the country. “Sometimes you have to walk,” Trump 
said during a news conference following the conclusion of the summit, 
which broke up earlier than planned. “This was just one of those times.”
 But it was evident from early in the summit that Trump was seeking to 
tamp down expectations, repeating he’s in no rush to strike a deal even 
as North Korea continues to advance its nuclear weapons program. “I’ve 
been saying very much from the beginning that speed is not that 
important to me,” Trump said earlier Thursday at the summit’s outset. 
“Speed is not important to me. What is important is that we do the right
 deal.” Trump cast the lack of deal as only a short-term disappointment,
 even though he’d hoped coming into the talks to be able to point to a 
new, concrete pathway toward denuclearization. A major agreement struck 
in Hanoi may also have pushed aside embarrassing headlines about </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/politics/donald-trump-michael-cohen-world/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen testifying</a>
 the President is a racist conman. The President, who said scheduling 
Cohen’s testimony during his summit was a “terrible thing,” instead 
suggested the inconclusive talks with Kim were another step in a lengthy
 process toward convincing the young leader to abandon his nuclear 
program. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-friendship-chemistry/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">The personal chemistry that Trump has cultivated</a>
 — and loudly trumpeted — with the young despotic leader remains intact,
 the President insisted. And the summit ended amicably, without either 
man storming away. “It was a very friendly walk,” Trump said. </p>
<h3>‘Closer’</h3>
<p> Still, the absence of a joint agreement reflects an anticlimax for a
 summit event Trump had hoped would prove naysayers of his diplomacy 
wrong. He conceded that US and North Korean officials remain at odds 
about the precise definition of denuclearization, which is the 
ostensible goal of his efforts. “He has a certain vision and it’s not 
exactly our vision, but it’s a lot closer than it was a year ago and I 
think eventually we’ll get there,” Trump said. And he described Kim as 
singularly focused on ending the sanctions that have crippled his 
economy and helped bring him to the negotiating table in the first 
place. Trump said Kim had offered to begin dismantling the Yongbyon 
nuclear facility, a step that would have amounted to a major concession.
 But it wasn’t enough, Trump said, alluding to additional sites that 
comprise what is a deeply secretive nuclear program. “We asked him to do
 more and he was unprepared to do that,” said Secretary of State Mike 
Pompeo, who joined Trump on stage for the duration of the news 
conference. “Everyone had hoped we could do just a little bit better.” 
US and North Korean negotiators had been in Hanoi for days drafting 
language of a joint agreement ahead of the talks, and the ceremony was 
listed on a version of the President’s public schedule released 
Wednesday evening. Stephen Biegun, the President’s North Korea envoy, 
arrived several days before Trump to seal the document. During an 
expanded session with aides, Trump and Kim discussed the prospect of 
opening a US office in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital. Kim said he 
would welcome the idea, and Trump deemed it a “good idea.” Yet 
afterward, it appeared the chances for that — along with any other 
concessions or agreements — were dashed, even as the White House 
insisted the talks were productive. The two leaders departed the 
Metropole, the French-colonial hotel where the talks unfolded, around 
1:30 p.m. local time, roughly four-and-a-half hours after the talks 
began. They also left without participating in a working lunch, even as 
chefs had been preparing plates of foie gras and snow fish. </p>
<h3>Lowered expectations</h3>
<p> If the day ended without a triumphant finish, there were 
extraordinary moments peppered throughout the day. In unprecedented 
back-and-forth exchanges with journalists, Kim insisted he was open to 
denuclearization, though didn’t say what he believed that meant. It’s 
believed to be the first time Kim has answered a question from a foreign
 journalist, a landmark event for the iron-fisted dictator. “If I’m not 
willing to do that I won’t be here right now,” he said through an 
interpreter. Kim, for his part, also expressed cautious optimism earlier
 in the day that a deal would eventually be struck. But he did not 
suggest such an accord would come soon. “It’s too early to say,” he said
 in response to a foreign journalist’s shouted question. “From what I 
feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results will come out.” He
 again responded to journalists later in the day, albeit somewhat 
begrudgingly. The two leaders went back-and-forth over the prospect of 
exchanging liaison officers — a low level diplomatic partnership — after
 the issue was raised by a journalist. Initially, Kim seemed to reject 
the question, proposing to Trump that the media be excused from the 
room. But Trump seemed to goad him to answer, saying it was a good 
question. “I would like to hear that answer,” Trump said. Kim responded 
through his interpreter, saying it would be something that was 
“welcome-able.” Trump expressed a similar sentiment: “I actually think 
it’s a good idea.” Kim added it would be better for Trump and him to 
discuss it together in private. </p>
<h3>Trump’s dual objectives</h3>
<p> Trump was </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea-hanoi/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">pursuing two objectives as he sat down once again with the North Korean dictator</a>
 on Thursday: draw North Korea closer to the prospect of abandoning its 
nuclear weapons and regain control of the media narrative. As he arrived
 at the swanky Metropole Hotel on Wednesday to advance his historic 
direct diplomacy with Kim, Trump was quickly upstaged by the </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/politics/michael-cohen-testimony-house-committee/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">damning congressional testimony</a> of his longtime former attorney and adviser Michael Cohen. By the time </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea-hanoi/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump finished dinner with Kim</a>,
 the airwaves were blanketed with coverage of Cohen’s testimony. A grand
 agreement on denuclearization might have helped in that effort to 
change the narrative. But on Thursday Trump repeatedly downplayed the 
prospects of a deal emerging from the Hanoi talks and suggested 
something more vague might result from his second summit with Kim. “I 
can’t speak for today but over a little bit longer term … we’re going to
 have a fantastic success,” Trump said. He described his dinner an 
evening earlier as positive, but did not describe in detail any of the 
negotiations underway. “A lot of great ideas being thrown about,” Trump 
said. </p>
<h3>Cozy relationship with a brutal dictator</h3>
<p> The two leaders once again put their chummy personal relationship on
 display, walking along the flower-lined pool deck at the Metropole 
engaging in friendly conversation to give the cameras an opportunity to 
capture them in a more casual setting. The images will only serve to 
fuel criticism that Trump’s cozy diplomacy with Kim </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/world/asia/north-korea-human-rights.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">glosses over the rampant human rights abuses in North Korea</a>,
 which include Kim’s brutal assassinations of those who cross him and 
the imprisonment of thousands in labor camps. Trump largely avoided any 
mention of human rights during his talks with Kim, instead focusing on 
the prospects for financial investment if Kim agrees to abandon his 
nuclear weapons. When a reporter asked Kim whether the topic was 
discussed, Trump answered for him. “We’re discussing everything,” Trump 
said. Later, when asked about the treatment of Otto Warmbier, an 
American student who spent 17 months in North Korean detention before 
being returned to the US in a vegetative state and subsequently dying, 
Trump denied Kim had been aware of the incident. “He felt badly about 
it. He felt very badly,” Trump said. “He tells me that he didn’t know 
about it and I will take him at his word.” “I don’t think that the top 
leadership knew about it,” Trump added. “I don’t believe that he (Kim) 
would have allowed that to happen.” While Trump continues to insist that
 there is no rush to make progress, North Korea has continued to develop
 its nuclear weapons program and expanded its nuclear arsenal. In just 
the past year, North Korea is estimated to have produced enough fissile 
material for an additional five to seven nuclear weapons, </p>
<p><a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/news/north-korea-2018-qa-siegfried-hecker" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Stanford University’s Center for International Security and Cooperation</a>.
 That nuclear production is expected to continue so long as Trump does 
not secure a verifiable freeze in North Korea’s nuclear production — a 
US objective that so far has remained elusive. </p>
