<h1 class="rm-manual">North Korea revives ‘dotard’ insult after Trump’s ‘Rocket Man’ comment ‘displeased’ Kim Jong Un</h1>
<p>A senior member of the North Korean government has again described 
Donald Trump as a “dotard” after the US President revived the war words 
with <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/11/28/asia/north-korea-launch-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korean leader</a> Kim Jong Un by calling him “Rocket Man.”</p>
<p>Choe Son Hui, North Korea’s First Vice-Foreign Minister, was quoted 
by North Korea’s state news agency as saying the foreign ministry “can 
not repress displeasure over the utterances made by President Trump 
inappropriately at the most sensitive time.”</p>
<p>Choe added: “If any language and expressions stoking the atmosphere 
of confrontation are used once again on purpose at a crucial moment as 
now, that must really be diagnosed as the relapse of the dotage of a 
dotard.”</p>
<p>Speaking of the North Korean leader at the NATO summit in London on 
Tuesday, Trump said: “He really likes sending rockets up, doesn’t he? 
That’s why I call him Rocket Man.” Trump added that he and Kim have “a 
good relationship.”</p>
<p>The statement on Thursday is the latest in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/asia/north-korea-christmas-gift-kim-jong-un-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of increasingly dire warnings</a> by North Korea, and recalls<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/21/politics/kim-jong-un-on-trump-comments/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the strong language</a> between the two leaders that escalated in 2017, before a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/11/politics/trump-kim-summit-singapore/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">landmark meeting </a>the following year in Singapore.</p>
<p>Pak Jong Chon, the chief of staff of the Korean People’s Army, said 
Wednesday that Kim was “displeased” by what he called “undesirable 
remarks” about North Korea made by US President Donald Trump on Tuesday 
in London, where he was attending NATO meetings.</p>
<p>Pak’s comments come amid a ratcheting up in rhetoric from the North 
Koreans ahead of the country’s self-imposed end-of-year deadline for 
negotiations with the US.</p>
<p>A foreign ministry official said earlier this week that Pyongyang was preparing a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/asia/north-korea-christmas-gift-kim-jong-un-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Christmas gift,” </a>for Washington, but warned that the present the Trump administration will receive depends on events in the coming days.</p>
<p>When Trump was asked about North Korea’s recent uptick in missile 
tests and the status of nuclear talks Tuesday, he referred to Kim as 
“Rocket Man” — a nickname the President coined during the standoff 
between Pyongyang and Washington in 2017 — and hinted that his 
administration reserved the right to use force.</p>
<p>“We have the most powerful military we’ve ever had and we’re by far 
the most powerful country in the world. And, hopefully, we don’t have to
 use it, but if we do, we’ll use it. If we have to, we’ll do it,” Trump 
said.</p>
<p>Those comments appear to have rubbed Kim and the top North Korean leadership the wrong way.</p>
<p>High-ranking North Korean army officials like Pak do not often issue 
public statements, and when they do they’re usually focused on tensions 
between North and South Korea, according to Michael Madden, an expert in
 North Korean leadership at the Stimson Foundation.</p>
<p>Pak was recently photographed alongside Kim on horseback touring 
Mount Paektu, an important site in North Korean lore, often used for 
propaganda purposes. That means it’s likely his statement Wednesday 
carries added weight.</p>
<p>Pak said that while he recognized Trump attached preconditions when 
discussing the use of military force against North Korea, the 
President’s comments still “greatly disappointed” him.</p>
<p>“Such elated spirit and bluffing may greatly get on the nerve of the 
dialogue partner even at the slightest slip,” he said. “The use of armed
 forces against the DPRK will be a horrible thing for the US.”</p>
<h3>Cracks in the friendship? </h3>
<p>John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University’s Graduate School of 
International Relations, said the fact that Pak brought up Trump’s 
comments was particularly concerning, and believes that Pak’s statement 
was likely a response to Trump bringing back the rhetoric that was 
common in 2017.</p>
<p>“It’s just short of Kim Jong Un himself saying it … but it’s getting 
very close to the point where Kim Jong Un says kind of directly to Trump
 that I’ve lost faith in you,” Delury said.</p>
<p>Diplomats from Pyongyang and Washington have been attempting to 
negotiate a trade that would see Kim give up the country’s nuclear 
weapons and the ballistic missiles used to deliver them in exchange for 
relief from punishing US and United Nations sanctions that have crippled
 the North Korean economy.</p>
<p>Though North Korea first detonated a nuclear device in 2006, 
Pyongyang successfully test-fired missiles that could potentially hit 
the US mainland with a nuclear warhead for the first time in 2017 — 
upping the stakes significantly and increasing the urgency to reach a 
peaceful solution to a decades-long struggle.</p>
<p>North Korea has this year continually blamed the US for the lack of 
progress in nuclear negotiations, singling out Secretary of State <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/04/18/politics/north-korea-us-pompeo-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Pompeo</a>
 and former National Security adviser John Bolton for censure. However, 
Pyongyang has made a notable effort not to criticize Trump and has 
emphasized the importance of the two leaders’ relationship.</p>
<p>Pak again did so Wednesday in his statement, saying he thinks “the 
only guarantee that deters physical conflict from flaring up in 
relations between the DPRK (the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, 
North Korea’s formal name) and the US despite such a dangerous military 
stand-off is the close relations between the top leaders.”</p>
<p>North Koreans are particularly sensitive to any perceived insults 
directed at the ruling Kim family. After former Vice President Joe Biden
 called Kim a dictator last month during a campaign rally, North Korea’s
 state-run Korean Central News Agency published a commentary calling him
 a “rabid dog” that “must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is 
too late.”</p>
<p>Even if Trump was joking when he brought back a favorite nickname he 
used before his budding friendship with Kim, the President may have been
 playing with fire.</p>
