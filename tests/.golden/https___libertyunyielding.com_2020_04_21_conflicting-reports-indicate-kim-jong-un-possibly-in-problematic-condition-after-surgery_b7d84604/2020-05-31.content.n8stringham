Dyer</a></span></span> <span><a href="https://libertyunyielding.com/2020/04/21/conflicting-reports-indicate-kim-jong-un-possibly-in-problematic-condition-after-surgery/" rel="bookmark">April 21, 2020</a></span> </p>

<p>This is a breaking news story and of course a difficult one, given 
the exceptional dearth of reliable information from North Korea. 
Multiple news sites in Washington confirm they are receiving reports on 
it from U.S. officials, however. There appears to be something to it; 
the question is exactly what.</p>
<p>CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html">reported</a>
 a short time ago that Kim Jong Un was said by an unnamed U.S. official 
to be “in grave danger after surgery.” The CNN report indicated that 
this came from U.S. intelligence.</p>
<p>CNN says another U.S. official tells them “the concerns about Kim’s health are credible but the severity is hard to assess.”</p>
<p>Kim Jong-Un reportedly had heart surgery on 12 April and has been in 
recovery in the 8 days since. He missed appearing at the official 
commemoration of his grandfathers’s (Kim Il-Sung) birthday on 15 April.</p>

<p>Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/kim-jong-un-cardiovascular-procedure-north-korea">has much the same information</a>,
 but doesn’t attribute it to U.S. intelligence monitoring. Says Fox: 
“Sources told Fox News that the White House is aware of the reports of 
Kim’s health, but there is no confirmation.”</p>
<p>All kinds of speculation is rampant in the media, both among the 
cable news talking heads and on social media. OAN says officials have 
told them a Chinese doctor was called in to attend Kim Jong-Un, and 
ended up infecting him with COVID-19.</p>
<p>That’s possible, although the likelihood of U.S. intelligence making 
such a disclosure with confidence is low. I suggest not running with it.
 It’s just something to be aware of. Apparently someone wants to have 
the “disclosure” out there, at any rate, so it’s not worthless as a data
 point.</p>
<p>BREAKING: Multiple US officials tell <a href="https://twitter.com/OANN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OANN</a>
 that Kim Jong Un caught COVID19 from a Chinese doctor flown in to help 
with his heart valve surgery. He appears to be in stable condition for 
now.</p>
<p>— Jack Posobiec, IWO (@JackPosobiec) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1252443559053201408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></p>
<p>Obviously the implications of this would be significant if Kim 
Jong-Un’s health were at such grave risk that he might not (or did not) 
survive. South Korea has been downplaying the matter, declining to add 
to the speculation frenzy. Rather than rewrite it at unnecessary length,
 I’ll just post my tweet on that point.</p>
<p>South Korea's not going to give out a play-by-play. This is a massive
 nat'l security situation for them. They'll consolidate their position 
for response, AND their response, first. No tipping their hand thru 
press releases; all managed comms externally &amp; back-channel coord. <a href="https://t.co/ri83oS4Iu8">https://t.co/ri83oS4Iu8</a></p>
<p>— J.E. Dyer (@OptimisticCon) <a href="https://twitter.com/OptimisticCon/status/1252441879838199811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></p>
<p>Beyond that, there is limited utility in spinning out scenarios from a
 position of ignorance. We don’t really know how bad it is, although if 
we’re hearing about it at all, it’s legitimate to assume Kim’s life is, 
in fact, at stake. It’s CNN giving the worst report of Kim’s health 
(“grave danger’), which is a red flag for me. CNN is one of several 
outlets that make themselves the path of least resistance for “leaks” 
targeting the Trump administration’s foreign policy. Perhaps U.S. 
intelligence thinks it’s as bad as CNN says. Perhaps not.</p>
<p>That said, if it is that bad, and Kim may not survive, it’s not 
actually obvious what would happen next. Most mainstream media have come
 out speculating about Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong. Maybe. It may depend 
on who from outside North Korea can manage the fanciest footwork. Don’t 
discount the possibility that this could be a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity to influence the successor regime in Pyongyang and set 
history on a new course. President Trump has already set the key 
condition for that: decoupling North Korean relations in general from 
the exclusive brokerage of Beijing.</p>
<p>Nothing like that would be done in the open, at least not initially. 
But the U.S. has the friends for it in the neighborhood. There’s never a
 time so unpropitious for correcting the longstanding situation on the 
Korean peninsula that it shouldn’t be tried.</p>
<p>South Korea’s Moon Jae-In has a very solid governing mandate after <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/korea-watch/president-moon-jae-wins-big-mandate-historic-south-korean-elections-144677">a massive victory</a>
 for the Democrats in last week’s election; I don’t have enough of a 
sense of him to predict whether he’s up to the job of grabbing the reins
 and going for reunification. Any such move has to be spearheaded by 
Seoul. They’ll keep their cards close to the vest, and they won’t want 
to aggressively alienate China, even if they have the courage, with U.S.
 backing, to act independently.</p>
<p>At any rate, it’s early days yet. We’ll see where this goes.</p>
