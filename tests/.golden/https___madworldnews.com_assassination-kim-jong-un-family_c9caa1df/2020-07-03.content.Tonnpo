<figcaption class="">Tyrannical North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un (left), his older half-brother Kim Jong-nam (right)</figcaption><p>Kim
 Jong-nam, the 45-year-old half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim 
Jong-un, was assassinated at Kuala Lumpur airport while awaiting a 
flight to Macau on Monday. Now, reports out of Malaysia appear to reveal
 who ordered the killing, and the information is enough to send chills 
down your spine.</p>
<p>Proving his bitter ruthlessness, Kim Jong-un allegedly had his own 
brother assassinated by two women who snuck up from behind and attacked 
him with either poisoned needles or toxic spray, though the cause of 
death has not yet been confirmed, pending the results of an autopsy. The
 female assassins then immediately hailed a cab and left the scene. 
Meanwhile, Jong-nam died in an ambulance on the way to Putrajaya 
Hospital after collapsing at the airport.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">(Advertisement Below)</p>
<p>The eldest son of former North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il, Jong-nam 
had fallen out of favor with his home country as of late after speaking 
out publicly against his family’s dynastic control of the isolated 
state. Consequently, he began to fear for his life. It now appears that 
he had every reason to worry that he would be targeted by his tyrannical
 half-brother.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">(Advertisement Below)</p>
<p>So far there are no suspects, but we have started investigations and are looking at a few possibilities to get leads.</p>
<p>The deceased … felt like someone grabbed or held his face from 
behind. He felt dizzy, so he asked for help at the … counter of KLIA.</p>
<p>We don’t know if there was a cloth or needles; the receptionist said someone grabbed his face, he felt dizzy.</p>
<figcaption>Kim Jong-un, center, allegedly had his own half-brother killed.</figcaption><p>Cheong
 Seong-Jang, the senior researcher at Seoul’s Sejong Institute 
think-tank, said that “if Jong-Nam committed an act to damage Jong-Un’s 
authority, I think it’s possible that the Reconnaissance General Bureau 
may have directly conducted the assassination under the orders of 
Jong-Un since it has been in charge of closely watching Jong-Nam.”</p>
<p>It’s difficult to imagine a scenario where family feuds are settled 
through covert assassinations, though this is the norm when it comes to 
North Korea.</p>

 Weiner, divulged in court the sick twisted thing that he and the North
