<h1 class="rm-manual">US and South Korea Accused of Assassination Attempt of its leader Kim Jong Un by North Korea, But How True is It?</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span> Posted by <span>MarriedBiography</span> </span><span><span> Last Modified May 6, 2018</span></span> | In <a href="https://marriedbiography.com/category/career/" rel="category tag">Career</a> , <a href="https://marriedbiography.com/category/lifestyle/" rel="category tag">Lifestyle</a></p>
<p class="">Recently, the North Korean state news agency, KCNA put u a report on the conspired assassination attempt on its leader, <a href="https://marriedbiography.com/kim-jung-un-biography/">Kim Jong Un</a>. In this section, we will try out on the claim of the North Korean report.</p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual">Source: ABC News (Kim Jong Un)</figcaption><h2 class="">The Report and Accusation</h2>
<p>On Friday, May 5, 2017, the North Korean state news agency KCNA 
(Korean Central News Agency) said a “hideous terrorist group” had 
conspired with the CIA and South Korea’s Intelligence Service (IS) to 
“commit bomb terrorism targeting the supreme leadership” during major 
events including a recent military parade.</p>
<figcaption>Source: CBC (Kim in a military parade)</figcaption><p>The 
1800-worded report maintained and has blamed the US and South Korea of 
an assassination attempt on the North Korean Supreme Leader <a href="https://marriedbiography.com/kim-jong-un/">Kim Jong-un</a>
 with a “biochemical substance.” The report also claimed that a North 
Korean citizen was also involved in the plot, using “biochemical 
substances including radioactive substance and nano poisonous substance”
 to target Kim.</p>
<p>The KCNA report claimed the plot was “recently uncovered and 
smashed,” and it accused the members of the CIA (Central Intelligence 
Agency – US) and IS (Intelligence Service – South Korea) of working with
 an unnamed North Korean citizen to provide money and weapons to carry 
out “state-sponsored terrorism.”</p>
<figcaption>Source: War on the Rocks (CIA)</figcaption><p>The Supreme 
Leader would likely have been targeted at a military parade or a public 
procession, with the results not being visible for six to twelve months 
afterward, it said. It also said that North Korea would find and 
“mercilessly destroy” the terrorists.</p>
<p>It comes amid high tensions in the region.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Comments</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">Meanwhile, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/05/asia/north-korea-kim-assassination/index.html?sr=fbCNN050517north-korea-kim-assassination1030AMVODtopLink&amp;linkId=37228479" rel="nofollow noopener">IS did not respond to a request for comment.</a></p>
<h2>Counterattack Against the South Korean Charge?</h2>
<p>A similar charge was laid against Pyongyang by Seoul in February 2017
 following the murder of Kim Jong Nam, the elder half-brother of North 
Korean leader Kim Jong Un, allegedly at the hands of North 
Korean-appointed agents. Nam was poisoned with the VX nerve agent while 
in Kuala Lumpur airport. He died en route to a local hospital.</p>
<p>North Korea has repeatedly denied its hand in Kim Jong Nam’s death.</p>
<h2>History of unfounded claims</h2>
<p>North Korea has a past history of doing bombastic propaganda featuring unfounded claims.</p>
<p>For example, last month, the state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun went on to <a href="http://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2017/04/26/darwin-aiding-us-war-preparation--north-korea.html" rel="nofollow noopener">claim
 that the US-Australian military exercises in northern Australia were a 
part of the preparation for nuclear war against the Hermit Kingdom. It 
also threatened Darwin with a potential retaliatory strike</a>.</p>
<h2>Admitting part from the South Korean side</h2>
<p>For its part, South Korea has admitted to having made some plans to kill Kim.</p>
<p>Last year, their lawmakers said,</p>
<p>“Seoul has a general idea and plan to use precision missile 
capabilities to target the enemy’s facilities in major areas as well as 
eliminating the enemy’s leadership.”</p>
<figcaption>Source: Alamy (South Korean Parliament building)</figcaption><p>South
 Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff has developed a system called the Korea 
Massive Punishment and Retaliation (KMPR) which comprised of surgical 
missile attacks, entire special warfare units as well as a potential to 
strike Pyongyang’s leadership if Seoul feels threatened by any nuclear 
attack.</p>
<h2>Who is Kim Jong Un?</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://marriedbiography.com/kim-jong-un-says-new-missile-gift-american-bs-north-korea-us-independence-day/">Kim Jong-un</a>
 is the Chairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) as well as the 
supreme leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), 
often referred to as North Korea. Kim is the world’s most youthful 
serving state leader. He is also the first North Korean supreme leader 
to have been born after the country was established. He is known to be
