<h1 class="rm-manual">US announces $8.3bn in coronavirus funding as cases surge</h1>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"> Credit: CC0 Public Domain </figcaption><p>
 US lawmakers passed an emergency $8.3 billion spending bill to combat 
the coronavirus on Thursday as the number of cases surged in the 
country's northwest and deaths reached 12. </p>
<p>The Senate gave sweeping bipartisan support to the funding one day 
after the House passed the bill, so that it could be quickly sent to the
 White House for President Donald Trump's signature.</p>
<p>"The American people are looking for leadership, they want assurance 
their government is up to the task of protecting their health and 
safety," said Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy.</p>
<p>The amount is significantly above the $2.5 billion President Donald 
Trump had initially requested, but he later said he was happy to accept 
more.</p>
<p>The US reported its first case of the disease in January and its 
first death on February 29—both in the state of Washington in the 
country's Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Since then the toll has risen to 12 and the virus has spread to at 
least 15 states—the latest being Maryland adjacent to the nation's 
capital Washington.</p>
<p>More than 180 people are infected, according to an AFP tally.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Washington state officials announced a jump in cases, 
from 39 to more than 70. Eleven of the 12 deaths have been reported 
there, with the other in California.</p>
<p>Tech firms in Seattle like Amazon, Facebook and Google were telling 
employees to work remotely, as was Microsoft in nearby Redmond.</p>
<p>Some schools in the state have also decided to close for a couple weeks and hold classes online.</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence, the White House pointman on the crisis, visited the state later in the day.</p>
<p>He greeted Governor Jay Inslee and other officials with an "elbow 
bump," intended to avoid the germ transmission of a traditional 
handshake.</p>
<p>Some 1.2 million tests would be distributed nationwide in "a few 
days," followed by another four million by the end of next week, said 
Pence.</p>
<p>Earlier Thursday in Minnesota, Pence had told reporters that "we 
don't have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the 
demand going forward."</p>
<p>Meanwhile a cruise ship with 21 people who have symptoms was being 
held off the coast of San Francisco, California. The state has the 
second highest number of cases and has declared an emergency.</p>
<p>Thousands of people are traveling aboard the Grand Princess, the same
 cruise ship on which California's first victim was thought to have 
contracted the virus.</p>
<p>The Grand Princess belongs to Princess Cruises, the company that 
operated the coronavirus-stricken ship held off Japan last month on 
which more than 700 people tested positive.</p>
<p>Carolyn Wright, a passenger, told AFP that the captain announced 
Thursday evening there were "no confirmed cases of coronavirus on the 
ship" so far, echoing a tweet from Princess Cruises earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Nursing union slams preparation</p>
<p>US officials continue to stress that the overall risk to the public 
remains low and are urging people not to panic or buy masks—which could 
create a shortage for those who require them.</p>
<p>Scientific research so far shows that elderly people and those with 
underlying conditions are most at risk of a serious illness, and the 
majority of US deaths so far have occurred in a Seattle-area nursing 
home.</p>
<p>But the largest nursing union in the US denounced Thursday the "disturbing" lack of preparation at many hospitals.</p>
<p>Nurses are working without necessary personal protective equipment 
and lack education and training for handling the disease, said National 
Nurses United director Bonnie Castillo.</p>
<p>"As of today more than 80 of our nurse members have been in 
quarantine," she said at a press conference in California held by the 
union, which claims 150,000 members.</p>
<p>"It is not a successful strategy to leave nurses and other health workers unprotected."</p>
<p>Revised mortality rate</p>
<p>Earlier, a top federal health official said the overall mortality 
rate for the novel coronavirus was estimated at one percent or less, 
lower than previously thought.</p>
<p>"The best estimates now of the overall mortality rate for COVID-19 is
 somewhere between 0.1 percent and one percent," Admiral Brett Giroir, 
the assistant secretary of health, said at a news briefing.</p>
<p>"That's... because many people don't get sick and don't get tested—this reflects the overseas experience.</p>
<p>"It certainly could be higher than normal flu, it probably is, but it's not likely in the range of two to three percent." </p>
