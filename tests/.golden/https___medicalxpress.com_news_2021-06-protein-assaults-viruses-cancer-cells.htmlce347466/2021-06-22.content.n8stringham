<h1 class="rm-manual">How a protein named STING assaults viruses and cancer cells that invade us</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> by Delthia Ricks , Medical Xpress </p>

of Hepatitis C, The Rockefeller University. </figcaption><p>The 
molecular world is full of surprises, and none more stunning than those 
occurring among the infinitesimal proteins that drive the activities 
guarding against viral infections and cancer. </p>
<p>In Canada, molecular biologists have found that the activity of a 
single protein, which strongly influences antiviral and antitumor immune
 responses, is regulated by the <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/amino+acid+cysteine/" rel="tag">amino acid cysteine</a>.</p>
<p>But what may seem at first blush an arcane discovery involving amino 
acid chemistry turns out to be a finding of timely significance. A team,
 led by scientists at Center Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, 
has elucidated in intricate new detail the signaling activity that 
underlies how emerging cancers are thwarted. And of equal 
importance—especially in the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic—a 
finding that sheds new light on a critical piece in the larger jigsaw 
puzzle of how immune forces are alerted to attack viral infiltrators.</p>
<p>Having unraveled one of nature's mysteries about a series of key 
innate immune system activities, the scientists have opened a new window
 of understanding into a biological pathway that can aid the development
 of new cancer immunotherapies. And the same novel pathway, these 
scientists say, may hold sway over vaccine development in the 
not-too-distant future as researchers become ever mindful of the 
critical first steps in the innate <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+response/" rel="tag">immune response</a>.</p>
<p>The new research centers on what is known as an adapter protein, a 
molecule formally called STING, which stands for stimulator of 
interferon genes. STING arrives in an early phase of the innate immune 
response, and cysteine, an amino acid, regulates STING's conformation 
and activity.</p>
<p>But the Canadian team discovered that a specific cysteine residue 
limits the full antiviral and antitumor effects of STING. The 
researchers are calling for the development of novel therapeutic 
interventions that can circumvent the residue, hence allowing the full 
biological impact of STING.</p>
<p>The Center Hospitalier research also involved molecular biologists at
 l'Université de Montréal's departments of biochemistry and molecular 
medicine who contributed to exploring STING. But while STING may seem an
 obscure protein, the new research has brought it out of the molecular 
shadows and into a spotlight. Its role in viral infectious diseases, the
 scientists say, is pivotal. As soon as a viral infection is detected, 
STING strikes.</p>
<p>"The adaptor protein STING is stimulated in response to the detection
 of cytosolic viral DNA by the enzyme cGAS," wrote Dr. Natalia Zamorano 
Cuervo and colleagues, referring to the protein, cyclic GMP-AMP 
synthase, or cGAS. It is one in a cascade of signaling molecules that is
 in the first wave of innate immune system responses.</p>
<p>Whenever a <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/virus/" rel="tag">virus</a>,
 such as herpesvirus—a DNA virus—causes infection, its DNA is recognized
 by cGAS, a sensor of foreign nucleic acids. This, in turn, catalyzes a 
series of rapid biological events—among them, activating STING. "STING 
activation then leads to the expression of genes encoding type I 
interferons as part of the antiviral response. STING activation also 
plays a role in antitumor immunity, making STING an important 
therapeutic target, Zamorano Cuervo and her team wrote in the journal 
Science Signaling.</p>
<p>STING is most vital in the innate immune response to pathogens that 
take up residence inside cells, namely viruses. Viral DNA in the 
cellular cytosol activates cGAS, which in turn generates a molecule that
 activates STING. STING activation triggers genes for type I interferons
 in the early antiviral response. This basic scenario—cGAS to STING to 
type I interferons—occurs whether the offender is a virus or a tumor 
cell. In <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/viral+infections/" rel="tag">viral infections</a>, STING's inducing the production of type I interferons stimulates an immune response that promotes viral clearance.</p>
<p>In addition to DNA viruses, cGAS binds to double-stranded DNA from 
various other invaders, including bacteria. And while cGAS is a master 
at binding to foreign DNA, there is evidence that it's also involved in 
restricting RNA virus infection. The cGAS-STING research arena is an 
active area of investigation worldwide. But scientists underscore that 
many questions about the cGAS-STING signaling axis remain unanswered, 
part of a still-unexplored frontier.</p>
<p>The Montréal scientists relied on mass spectrometry and structural 
analyses to identify cysteine residues that underwent reversible 
oxidation during the activation of STING. One specific residue, oxidized
 either in response to other oxidants in the cytosolic milieu, or a 
molecule involved as an activator of STING, led to a loss of STING 
robustness. Regardless of which of the two is the cause, the team 
determined that loss as a key limitation. Recognizing that STING 
activity can become limited, Zamorano Cuervo and collaborators say 
designing targeted therapeutics can override that limitation and 
modulate STING's activity in both viral infections and cancer. </p>
<p>"Pinpointing cysteine oxidation sites by high-resolution proteomics 
reveals a mechanism of redox-dependent inhibition of human STING," 
Zamorano Cuervo and her team concluded.</p>
<p>The loss of robustness, which occurs because of a change in redox 
status, is not isolated to STING—scientists have seen it before. For 
example, changes in redox status occur during various cellular 
processes, including viral infections.</p>
<p>"Whereas chronically increased amounts of reactive oxygen 
species—ROS—might be associated with oxidative damage, local changes in 
ROS abundance act as redox switches to regulate cellular signaling," 
Zamorano Cuervo wrote. "Increased ROS abundance has been documented 
during various infections by DNA viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus and
 Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus, as well as RNA viruses, 
including hepatitis C virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza 
virus, and human immunodeficiency virus." </p>
