<p class="rm-manual">Written by C.W.S.</p>
<p>When two young women approached the half-brother of the North Korean 
dictator at the shopping concourse at Kuala Lumpur airport in Malaysia, 
one distracted him while the other sprayed something into his face. Kim 
Jong-Nam felt dizzy after and went to an information desk for help. He 
died on the way to the hospital on February 13th.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-Nam</p>
<p>Police official Fadzil Ahmat initially told Reuters that “The 
deceased ... felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind. We 
don’t know if there was a cloth or needles. The receptionist said 
someone grabbed his face, he felt dizzy.”</p>
<p>Reports are now coming out that the woman sprayed Kim Jong-Un’s 
half-brother in the face with a fast-acting toxin. So how did a 
25-year-old woman find herself at the center of a high-profile 
assassination? Police are now stating that Siti Aisyah believed that she
 was taking part in a game show called “Just For Laughs.”</p>
<p>The photo of the other yet unnamed woman that is being shown in news 
reports was captured on CCTV during the assassination. It is pixilated 
and bright, showing the woman in a white sweater with the letters LOL 
printed in large black letters. Apparently, the women had been taking 
part in a game where they convinced men to close their eyes and then 
sprayed them with water.</p>
<p>"Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a 
few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong-Nam, allegedly 
there were dangerous materials in the sprayer," Indonesia's national 
police chief, Tito Karnavian said. "She was not aware that it was an 
assassination attempt by alleged foreign agents."</p>
<p>Kim Jong-Il and Kim Jong-Un</p>
<p>Relatives of Aisyah also came out to say that she believed that she 
was traveling to China to appear in a comedy film. Aisyah’s mother, 
Benah, stated that it was “impossible” that her daughter was an 
assassin: “My daughter is not like that, she is just a country girl.”</p>
<p>The assassination has launched a great deal of speculation into who, 
exactly, is responsible. Many believe that the North Korean government 
organized the hit, due to the reigning family’s complicated relationship
 to Jong-Nam. Jong-Nam was a public critic of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, as it is known internally.</p>
<p>Although Jong-Nam was the eldest son of previous dictator Kim 
Jong-Il, it was clear early on to the family that Jong-Nam lacked the 
particular leadership skills they felt were necessary. Born in 1971 to 
Jong-Il and actress Song Hye-rim, it is speculated that the dictator at 
the time and Jong-Il’s father, Kim Il-sung, disapproved of his son’s 
relationship with Song, who was still married and had children when they
 began their relationship. Because of this, Jong-Nam was kept out of 
school and essentially hidden away. Nonetheless, his father doted on 
Jong-Nam, even sleeping in a bed with him. In 1979, Jong-Nam left North 
Korea to study outside the country, and apparently his father was so 
upset that he got drunk and wept.</p>
<p>In 2001, Jong-Nam was caught using a fake passport to enter Japan, 
claiming he wanted to visit Disneyland in Tokyo. It is thought that this
 embarrassed Jong-Il, costing Jong-Nam succession to his father’s 
position. Jong-Il died in 2011, allowing Jong-Nam’s younger brother 
access to his position as Dear Leader. Then, in 2012, Jong-Nam wrote a 
book in which he criticized his family’s control of North Korea, and 
stated his belief that his younger brother lacked leadership skills, 
further pushing him out of favor.</p>
<p>Jong-Nam gained a reputation as a playboy and jet-setter, but was 
living with his wife and two children in Macau on the south of China at 
the time of his death.</p>
<p>The Malaysian government has not agreed to release the body or 
autopsy reports to North Korea until a DNA sample is provided from one 
of Jong-Nam’s relatives. “So far no family member or next of kin has 
come to identify or claim the body,” Abdul Samah Mat said. “We need a 
DNA sample of a family member to match the profile of the dead person. 
North Korea has submitted a request to claim the body but before we 
release the body we have to identify who the body belongs to.”</p>
<p>North Korean boarder </p>
<p>Any form of media not sanctioned by the North Korean government is 
strictly forbidden in the state, including the internet in general. The 
25 million citizens of North Korea are kept almost completely in the 
dark about affairs outside, and the assassination of Kim Jong-Nam is no 
exception. As of February 17th, the country is still unaware of the 
events that happened on the 13th.</p>
<p>Now South Korea has announced that it will try to get this 
information in by loudspeaker, a tactic used in the past to counter 
propaganda. "We are considering providing information about the killing 
of Kim Jong Nam into North Korea via loudspeaker broadcast," a South 
Korean military officer told NBC News. The loudspeakers are so powerful 
that they can be heard for six miles.</p>
<p>So far, five people have been arrested in connection with the 
assassination. "We believe the North Korean regime is behind this 
incident, considering five suspects are North Koreans," Jeong Joon-hee, 
spokesman at South Korea's Unification Ministry, said on Sunday. At this
 time, officials cannot be certain who is to blame for the attack.</p>
