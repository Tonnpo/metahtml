<h1 class="rm-manual">Acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) or Ibuprofen ( Advil ) for Coronavirus?</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> by <span><a href="https://modernsurvivalblog.com/author/ken/" rel="author">Ken Jorgustin</a></span> | <span>Mar 16, 2020</span> | <a href="https://modernsurvivalblog.com/pandemic/" rel="category tag">PANDEMIC</a> | <span><a href="https://modernsurvivalblog.com/pandemic/acetaminophen-tylenol-or-ibuprofen-advil-for-coronavirus/#respond">74 comments</a></span></p>
<p>A report indicates that Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be preferred over Ibuprofen (Advil) for coronavirus (fever).</p>
<p>The health minister of France, Olivier Veran, (a doctor and neurologist) said recently, </p>
<p>“The taking of anti-inflammatories [ibuprofen, cortisone … ] could be
 a factor in aggravating the infection. In case of fever, take 
paracetamol [acetaminophen, tylenol]. If you are already taking 
anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor’s advice.”</p>
<p>Apparently, anti-inflammatory drugs are known to be a risk for those 
with infectious illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of 
the body’s immune system. Perhaps particularly important regarding 
Coronavirus.</p>
<p> Jean-Louis Montastruc, the head of pharmacology at Toulouse hospital, France, said:</p>
<p> “Anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of complications when there is a fever or infection.” </p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/anti-inflammatory-drugs-may-aggravate-coronavirus-infection">~ theguardian.com</a></p>
<p>Acetaminophen will reduce the fever without counterattacking the inflammation.</p>
<p>I first read about this from an article titled, </p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/french-warn-against-anti-inflammatory-drugs-to-treat-coronavirus-cleveland-doctor-wants-more-data.html">“French warn against anti-inflammatory drugs to treat coronavirus”</a></p>
<p>In the article, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and 
associate medical director for infection control at University Hospitals
 Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital said in response to the French 
ministers statement,</p>
<p>she is aware generally of what the French are saying and believes 
it’s probably based on a single study and therefore she is reluctant to 
accept any blanket statement. Also, the study would be looking at data 
from a lab setting and that the results in real life could be different.
 If more data comes out she might change her mind, she said. </p>
<h2>Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen?</h2>
<p>I just wanted to put this information out there.</p>
<p>If I personally happen to get the COVID-19 Coronavirus, I believe 
that my choice of fever reducer medication may be Acetaminophen. If and 
when more information comes out on this subject, I will update this 
post. </p>

 there are a lot of antiviral agents in the plant world. oregano, and 
garlic are two. Put in a search and get some, take by directions on 
bottle. as a daily preventative.. while you are searching put into 
search bar in several ways..holistic or natural antivirals. you should 
come up with another list of things that include colliodal silver… etc. 
If you prevent the virus from taking hold you will not need to be 
concerned with tylenol.</p> <span><a rel="nofollow" href="#comment-1698426">Reply</a></span> <p class="rm-manual"></p> </article> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span><a href="https://modernsurvivalblog.com/" rel="external nofollow ugc">Ken Jorgustin</a></span> <span> on 03/21/2020 at 8:05 AM </span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> </p><p class="rm-manual">First, don’t get the virus.

 I know Advil effects the kidneys but when my kidneys act up and don’t

cringe when I get a bout because I use Advil for the swelling and pain

 I looked this up also. My reference says it moderates cytokines in the 
body. I think the trick with elderberry is to be taking it before being 
exposed, as it kind of acts like a systemic antiviral, preventing any 
virus from replicating in your body. No virus replicating most likely 
means lower chance of cytokine storms, if I understand this right.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <span><a rel="nofollow" href="#comment-1697257">Reply</a></span> <p class="rm-manual"></p> </article> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>Odd hawk</span> <span> on 03/18/2020 at 10:18 PM </span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> </p><p class="rm-manual">I

 works (on most viruses) by inhibiting key enzymes necessary in the

pills I took before bed. a “4 -Ibuprofen night” meant I had a really 
rough day. I won’t go near Tylenol all. I’d rather suffer through a 
fever than take that amount of drugs.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <span><a rel="nofollow" href="#comment-1697503">Reply</a></span> <p class="rm-manual"></p> </article> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span><a href="https://modernsurvivalblog.com/" rel="external nofollow ugc">Ken Jorgustin</a></span> <span> on 03/17/2020 at 8:23 PM </span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> </p><p class="rm-manual">Yes,
 that’s what I’ve heard for absolute max. I’ve never taken that much.

 got caught up on Dr. John Campbell’s latest videos, and the one where 
he talks about fevers is very interesting. Makes a pretty good case for 
letting fevers run their course (in adults), since the virus fighting 
agents in our system work best when warmer. While he didn’t specify, I 
would imagine there’s some number you wouldn’t want your temperature to 
get over, but perhaps something up to about 101-102F might be more 
beneficial than not? Perhaps get rid of the infection sooner?</p> <span><a rel="nofollow" href="#comment-1697510">Reply</a></span> <p class="rm-manual"></p> </article> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>Minerjim</span> <span> on 03/17/2020 at 8:25 PM </span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> </p><p class="rm-manual">Finally,</p><p class="rm-manual">
 I have been saying this for a while. At least for myself, I’ll take the
 fever and skip the drugs and let my immune system try to fry the virus 
out. If I get too hot at some point I can always run through the 
vineyard naked at night, or jump in the irrigation canal.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <span><a rel="nofollow" href="#comment-1697522">Reply</a></span> <p class="rm-manual"></p> </article> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>Fireswamp</span> <span> on 03/17/2020 at 9:27 PM </span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> </p><p class="rm-manual">Fever is a temperature higher than 100.4 F</p><p class="rm-manual">
 Once temperatures are higher than 103-104F then it’s considered a high

 Usually you don’t have to reflex treat a temperature if it’s low grade

that showed some benefits of temperature helping your immune response</p><p class="rm-manual"> Hope this helps clarify</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <span><a rel="nofollow" href="#comment-1697547">Reply</a></span> <p class="rm-manual"></p> </article> </li> </ul> </li> </ol>
