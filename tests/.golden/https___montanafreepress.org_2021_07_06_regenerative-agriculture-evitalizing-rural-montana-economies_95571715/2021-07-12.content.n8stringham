<p>Wind and water have eroded Montana soils since the first plow turned 
earth on the Northern Plains more than 150 years ago, taking with them 
one of the state’s most important resources. Since then, tillage, plus 
the fertilizer and pesticides common in industrial agriculture, have 
continued to degrade the soil that agriculture depends on. With climate 
change threatening almost 25,000 Montana agricultural jobs in the next 
50 years, many farmers, ranchers and researchers believe the status quo 
is no longer adequate. And though conventional farming continues to 
account for the overwhelming majority of Montana’s $4.6 billion ag 
sector, things are shifting.</p>
<p>Part I of this series, supported by the Solutions Journalism Network,
 explores two responses to soil degradation in the age of climate 
change: organic and regenerative farming systems. </p>
<p>Organic has been a USDA certification since 2002, while regenerative 
lacks a codified or even consensus definition, but generally includes a 
suite of techniques like cover cropping, crop rotation and livestock 
integration that decrease erosion, improve biodiversity and capture 
carbon. Both systems have challenges and shortfalls, which are 
considered here, but a growing number of Montana producers are using 
them to build topsoil, become more resilient to drought, capture carbon 
and increase profits. </p>
<p>A slight haze hangs on the blue horizon above Ledger Road, 50 miles 
north of Great Falls in north-central Montana. Rectangles of spring 
crops and native grasses glow green alongside the dried straw of last 
year’s fallow. Forty miles north, the Sweetgrass Hills rise 3,700 feet 
above the high plains. </p>
<p>A mile down a side road, past another farm, the home place at Tiber 
Ridge Farm is an oasis of trees, farm buildings and birdsong. The farm 
sits in the geographic center of the Golden Triangle, a 
4,000-square-mile area between Great Falls, Havre and Cut Bank best 
known for producing high-protein wheat. </p>
<p>In the driveway, John Wicks starts his semi, a Freightliner with 
800,000 miles he bought used in 2007. That was right after his dad died 
and Wicks left Montana State University in Bozeman to help his mother on
 the farm where he grew up.</p>
<p>“It’s got a [fuel] leak, a pinhole somewhere that’s sucking air,” 
Wicks says, stepping away from the truck while it warms up. “So when I 
let it sit for a couple days, it’s hard to start.”</p>
<p>While he waits, Wicks talks to his wife, Gwyneth Givens, who’s 
building new raised beds for their summer garden with the hired hand, 
Peyton Cole.</p>
<figcaption>John Wicks puts away the fill auger on his air cart after 
planting the last of his organic barley at Tiber Ridge Farm north of 
Great Falls in early June 2021. <span>Credit: Jason Thompson / MTFP</span></figcaption><p>Once
 the truck is warmed up, Wicks climbs back into the cab and pulls left 
out of the driveway. As he descends toward Pondera Creek, the eastern 
end of Tiber Reservoir emerges into view between crumbling sandstone 
bluffs. In front of it, across the drainage, wind blows dust off a 
hilltop. </p>
<p>Wicks frowns. He and Givens planted those hilltop fields with winter 
wheat, but some of it died in a cold snap, making the ground susceptible
 to wind erosion. Like the majority of their neighbors in the Golden 
Triangle, they are dryland farmers, meaning they don’t irrigate.</p>
<p>“The tillage we’re doing is 2” deep — trying not to get in there and 
mess with our microbiome,” Wicks says. Traditional tillage, he explains,
 rips four to five inches down, destroying the interconnected web of 
plants, animals and microorganisms that make up a<a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/how-soil-erosion-threatens-food-and-farms"> healthy underground ecosystem</a>,
 which in turn provides nutrients for crops. Used for weed control and 
to loosen the soil for planting, tillage combined with drought caused 
the Dust Bowl of the 1930s and continues to cause severe erosion in 
Montana and<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/03/989984124/a-giant-organic-farm-faces-criticism-that-its-harming-the-environment"> elsewhere on the Great Plains</a>. </p>
<p>Located 26 miles from Chester, population 1,099, Tiber Ridge Farm is 
in one of Montana’s most significant agricultural areas. The nine 
counties that roughly form the Golden Triangle grew<a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Montana/Publications/Annual_Statistical_Bulletin/2020/Montana-Annual-Bulletin-2020.pdf"> 61% of the state’s winter wheat and 58% of its barley</a> in 2019, and were second only to northeastern Montana in lentil production. In 2018, producers here grossed<a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Montana/Publications/Annual_Statistical_Bulletin/2020/Montana-Annual-Bulletin-2020.pdf"> $1.16 billion</a>, more than a quarter of the state’s annual $4.4 billion gross farm and ranch income. </p>
<p>As in the rest of Montana, most Golden Triangle farmers use the 
“conventional” techniques of modern industrial agriculture. Aiming for 
the highest crop yield possible, these are generally monocropping 
systems reliant on pesticides (including herbicides, insecticides and 
fungicides), synthetic fertilizers and genetically modified seeds. </p>
<p>In contrast, Wicks and Givens are borrowing methods <a href="https://civileats.com/2021/01/05/does-regenerative-agriculture-have-a-race-problem/">developed by indigenous farmers millennia ago</a>.
 They fight weeds and pests by rotating which crops they seed in a plot 
each year, for example, and by planting cover crop mixes of vegetables, 
grasses and clover that also return nitrogen and biomass to the soil and
 protect against erosion. They also lease land to neighboring ranchers, 
whose grazing cattle aerate the soil with their hooves and add organic 
matter and nutrients via manure. </p>
<p>“When I was farming [before], I sprayed, and I liked what I thought 
was a really clean field. It took me a little mind-changing to realize 
that [the] soil was just dead … And I think that’s one of the things a 
lot of farmers struggle with, is admitting that maybe you weren’t doing 
the best practices.” </p>
<p>John Wicks</p>
<p>With climate change threatening almost <a href="https://montanaclimate.org/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/2017-MCA-Agriculture-Chapter-lr.pdf">25,000 Montana agricultural jobs</a>
 in the next 50 years, many farmers and ranchers are realizing the 
status quo is no longer adequate. And as a movement toward ecologically 
based agricultural practices gains ground nationwide, an increasing 
number of Montana producers are building topsoil, drought resilience and
 profits by integrating practices like organic or<a href="https://www.no-tillfarmer.com/articles/10340-podcast-jonathan-lundgren-on-evaluating-regenerative-farming-practices"> regenerative systems</a>. </p>
<p>Both approaches are expanding in the state. Because organic is a USDA certification, it’s easy to <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Organic_Production/pdf/2019_Organic_Executive_Briefing.pdf">measure its growth in Montana</a>, which is second only to California in certified organic acreage. Regenerative, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.577723/full">lacks a codified or even consensus definition</a>,
 but generally includes techniques like cover cropping, crop rotation 
and livestock integration. Although regenerative approaches are harder 
to track, one likely indicator, cover cropping, is up by 489% over the 
last 10 years in programs supported by the USDA’s Natural Resources 
Conservation Service. </p>
<p>For producers working to improve their farm’s soil health and 
economic stability, transitioning to an organic or regenerative system 
is a long game. They’re investing not only in this year’s yields, but in
 the future of their farms, their communities, and the system that 
produces food for both U.S and global consumption. A growing body of 
research also points to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12334">regenerative agriculture’s ability to sequester carbon</a>, although <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/regenerative-agriculture-good-soil-health-limited-potential-mitigate-climate-change">how much is yet to be determined</a>. </p>
<p>But farmers and ranchers can’t overhaul America’s food system 
themselves, and they might not need to. On June 8, the USDA announced a 
more than <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2021/06/08/usda-invest-more-4-billion-strengthen-food-system">$4 billion investment in the nation’s food system</a>
 aimed at strengthening supply chains, creating new market 
opportunities, responding to climate change, helping underserved 
communities and supporting good-paying jobs. Depending on how those 
funds are allocated, they may allow more Montana farmers to build soil 
health and add economic resiliency to their operations. </p>
<h3>TRANSITIONING TO ORGANIC</h3>
<p>Wicks was 21 when he left MSU and returned to the family farm. At first, he and his mother farmed about 1,300 acres, all wheat. </p>
<p>“A lot of years, we were going backwards and rolling our debt over, 
just building up our long-term debt,” said Wicks, now 36. “It was really
 scary.” </p>
<p>Wicks had considered transitioning to organic for years, but he and 
his mother knew it was a risk. When Givens moved to Tiber Ridge, her 
support gave him the extra push to make it happen. </p>
<p>Givens, 35, grew up on a seed-cleaning operation in Big Sandy, 90 
minutes east of Tiber Ridge. After attending culinary school in Denver 
and working as a pastry chef at a yacht club in Florida and the Northern
 Hotel in Billings, she moved to the farm in 2015. That year, they 
planted a home garden and cleaned up the farmyard. She got jobs cooking 
at a bar in Hingham and a coffee shop in Fort Benton, but quickly 
realized it didn’t make sense to drive an hour each way to work for 
minimum wage when there was plenty of farmwork to do. It just had to 
pencil out.</p>

<p class="">“But the farm had to make money to support a family, so 
that’s where that transition started to really make sense,” Givens said.
 </p>
<p class="">The couple began experimenting with organic crops in 2016. 
They planted 700 acres of organic red lentils and spring wheat. Wicks 
didn’t think they’d stick with it, but he wound up having fun farming 
that way, and at year’s end his books showed the organic crops were the 
most profitable. </p>
<figcaption class="">Fields of alternating crop and chemically forced 
fallow south of Tiber Reservoir. “Chem fallow” has been common in 
Montana since the herbicide Roundup became readily available in the 
1990s, because the technique preserves water and prevents erosion, but 
as weeds become increasingly resistant to herbicide, farmers are forced 
to use more each year. <span>Credit: Jason Thompson / MTFP</span></figcaption><p class="">Plus,
 he was getting tired of dealing with the chemicals, mostly the 
herbicide commonly known by the brand name Roundup. In 2015 he 
contracted chemical pneumonia, caused by inhaling toxins. He knew cancer
 was a concern (“most farmers just assume that’s what’s going to get 
them,” he said), but it was still several years before the class-action 
lawsuit against Roundup’s manufacturer, Bayer, which is now paying out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/business/roundup-settlement-lawsuits.html">$10 billion in a settlement to farmers who contracted cancer</a> after extended use. </p>
<p class="">Soon after they began experimenting with organic on part of 
the farm, weeds became so resistant to Roundup that chemical companies 
instead suggested Paraquat, which is<a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-worker-safety/paraquat-dichloride-one-sip-can-kill"> lethal to humans in even small amounts</a>.
 At that point, Wicks and Givens decided they were over it. In 2018 they
 went cold turkey on both pesticide and fertilizer, reducing their 
operational costs by $200,000 from the previous year, even with an added
 1,000 acres in production. </p>
<p class="">Wicks and Givens earned organic certification for their entire farm this year, and they’re now applying for the new<a href="https://regenorganic.org/"> regenerative organic certification</a>.
 Established in 2017 by a group of farmers, soil scientists, nonprofits 
and private businesses, the certification’s goal is to create “long-term
 solutions to the climate crisis, factory farming, and fractured rural 
economies.” Two other producers in Montana are also applying for the 
certification. </p>
<p class="">In the five years since they started down the organic road, 
Wicks and Givens have encountered obstacles. Insurance isn’t available 
for some specialty crops like Einkorn, for example, and they have to 
truck their barley to Anheuser-Busch’s organic grain elevator in Idaho 
Falls, rather than dropping it off at the company’s elevator an hour 
away in Conrad, which accepts only conventionally grown crops. And 
because organic takes more time and management overall, they had to 
really work for it. </p>
<p class="">After growing up on the farm and studying conventional 
agricultural practices at MSU for a year, the toughest thing, Wicks 
said, was changing his mindset.</p>
<p class="">“When I was farming [before], I sprayed, and I liked what I 
thought was a really clean field,” Wicks says over the rumble of his 
tractor. “It took me a little mind-changing to realize that [the] soil 
was just dead. So, starting over from that, realizing what I was doing 
wasn’t great. And I think that’s one of the things a lot of farmers 
struggle with, is admitting that maybe you weren’t doing the best 
practices.” </p>
<h3 class="">INVESTING IN RURAL COMMUNITIES </h3>
<p class="">A couple of miles west of the home place as the crow flies, 
Wicks parks the semi in a field. There he begins the half-hour process 
of loading 230 bushels of barley seed from the trailer into an air cart,
 a giant seed tank on wheels that he’ll tow behind a tractor. </p>
<p class="">Barley pours out of a funnel below the semi into a small 
basin, where a boom arm with a fill auger resembling a giant drill bit 
spins them up into the air cart. Sweat soaks Wicks’ shirt. It’s early 
June, and the temperature is 85 at 1 p.m. </p>
<figcaption class="">John Wicks drives his tractor during the last 
barley planting of the season. On this day he planted about 330 acres of
 the 600 acres he put in barley this year. He and his wife, Gwyneth 
Givens, are planting 4,500 acres in 2021: 3,000 acres in cash crops, and
 1,500 acres in cover crops. <span>Credit: Jason Thompson / MTFP</span></figcaption><p class="">Once
 the cart is full, Wicks starts the tractor, drives to where he left off
 the day before, and sets a GPS track. He starts a fan on the air cart, 
which pushes seeds through a set of tubes to another piece of machinery 
Wicks tows behind the air cart, a 50-foot-wide hoe drill that drags 50 
pointy hoes through the soil and inserts seeds every 12 inches. </p>
<p class="">Between cash and cover crops, Wicks and Givens are planting 
about 4,500 acres this year. Some of that land is leased from Wicks’ 
mother, who retired in 2019, and the rest they lease from neighbors. 
They’ve contracted most of the barley to Anheuser-Busch, though they’ll 
sell some to nearby Hutterite colonies for chicken feed. They’re also 
growing lentils, chickpeas, Kamut and Einkorn for smaller mills 
including Timeless Seeds and Montana Flour and Grain, both based in 
Montana. </p>
<p class="">Their yields are smaller than their conventional ones were, 
but Wicks said it’s worth it. Previously, they were at the mercy of 
international commodity markets, as well as ever-increasing seed, 
chemical and fertilizer prices. Organic producers often have more 
leverage, because they usually grow a diverse range of crops and sell 
directly to processors. Plus, many Montana organic grain and pulse 
growers forward-contract their crops, meaning they lock in a per bushel 
price before even planting. Wicks and Givens often sell their organic 
crops for two to three times the price of conventionally grown ones. </p>
<p class="">In turn, they spend locally, buying groceries in Chester, 
beef from a neighbor and equipment from local dealerships. Their 
equipment dealer,<a href="https://www.blondefarmsofmontana.com/about-us"> Gary Blonde</a>,
 sees the economic ripples of organic and regenerative, too. An organic 
farmer himself, Blonde sells farm machinery for Tilleman Equipment in 
Havre, where he says more people are buying tools specific to organic 
and regenerative farming. </p>
<p class="">“We cut the prairie sod, and then we basically mined the 
soil the sod had made, and now the mine is starting to go dry. Now we’re
 presented with the opportunity to rebuild the soil and put it back 
together. Soil is our livelihood and we better protect it, or we’re 
screwed. The writing is on the wall.”</p>
<p class="">Tim Seipel, MSU agricultural ecologist and extension specialist</p>
<p class="">“I’m seeing a huge increase in [equipment] purchases as guys
 get more experienced, because they’re finding different tools that can 
do jobs they once thought were impossible,” Blonde said. “And they’re 
just getting on their feet at this point to [make those investments].”</p>
<p class="">Wicks and Givens also invest in their community in other 
ways. Wicks serves on the Liberty County Farm Service Agency and Montana
 Organic Association boards, as well as the state Agriculture 
Development Council in Helena. He says they pay Cole, their hired hand, 
competitive wages and provide room and board. Originally from Chester, 
Cole moved back to the area when she lost her job in Missoula during the
 pandemic, and this is her first season on the farm. In addition to her 
wages, she’ll also earn a harvest bonus based on the farm’s 2021 profit.</p>
<p class="">In rural communities like Chester, it’s increasingly important to<a href="https://ilsr.org/key-studies-why-local-matters/#3"> keep money circulating locally</a>,
 said MSU agricultural economist George Haynes. More money in rural 
agricultural communities not only means more jobs, Haynes explained, but
 also a larger financial base that supports economic development, 
community investment and infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p class="">In the Chester of Wicks’ childhood, the town had a baker, 
three butcher shops and a factory that built cultivator parts. “Everyone
 shopped more locally,” Wicks said. “Now there’s no jobs like that.”</p>
<h3 class="">JOURNEY INTO REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</h3>
<p class="">Lack of jobs and loss of soil fertility in the Golden 
Triangle run parallel to each other. Once incredibly healthy, the soil 
here formed during the 11,000 years after the last Ice Age. As the 
prairie sod thickened, it absorbed water and carbon, becoming ever 
richer, said Tim Seipel, an MSU agricultural ecologist and extension 
specialist. Seipel compared that original sod to old-growth forest.</p>
<p class="">“We cut the prairie sod, and then we basically mined the 
soil the sod had made, and now the mine is starting to go dry,” Seipel 
said. <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/01/12/soil-degradation-costs-us-corn-farmers-half-billion-dollars-every-year#:~:text=One%2Dthird%20of%20the%20fertilizer,last%20month%20in%20Earth's%20Future.">That phenomenon is occurring on farmland worldwide</a> as erosion, salinization, acidification and nutrient loss degrade the soils humans need to produce food. </p>
<p class="">“Now we’re presented with the opportunity to rebuild the 
soil and put it back together,” Seipel said. “Soil is our livelihood and
 we better protect it, or we’re screwed. The writing is on the wall.”</p>
<figcaption class="">Wendy Fauque (right) and Willow Wieskamp set up a 
temporary electric fence at Happy Steer Ranch. They move the cows daily 
as part of an intensive grazing system. The animals fertilize the soil 
with manure and aerate it with their hooves, while the Fauques are able 
to make a profit by grazing their cover crops. <span>Credit: Jason Thompson / MTFP</span></figcaption><p class="">While soil health is codified into <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=fc9051a8365405526856c8b029f742ab&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se7.3.205_1203&amp;rgn=div8">organic regulations</a>,
 not all organic farmers control erosion effectively, and tilling too 
often or at the wrong time can have devastating effects. Just this year,
 dust blowing off an organic farm field in Chinook <a href="https://www.blainecountyjournal.com/story/2021/03/10/news/winter-winds-add-a-new-hazard-at-local-golf-course-drifts-of-dirt/6339.html">filled a fairway on the local golf course</a>
 three feet deep with dirt, according to Greg Jergeson, a retired farmer
 and former state legislator who sits on the Blaine County Conservation 
District board. The farmer had plowed right before a 75 mph wind event. 
He also described driving through white-out conditions on a road south 
of town, caused by dirt blowing off the same farmer’s fields. </p>
<p class="">Enter regenerative agriculture. </p>
<p class="">Fifty miles northwest of Tiber Ridge, gray clouds hang high 
over Happy Steer Ranch. The air is uncharacteristically calm, and 
lightning flashes a few miles off. </p>
<p class="">Set between Interstate 15 and the Sweetgrass Hills, Korey 
and Wendy Fauque’s 5,000-acre operation is a landscape of contrasts. 
From the ranch headquarters, four miles south of Sunburst and 23 north 
of Shelby, you can see oil rigs, wind turbines and the sharp rise of the
 Rocky Mountain Front.</p>
<p class="">In the closest pasture, a herd of 70 cow-calf pairs laze in 
the grass. Wendy paces 50 steps beyond a temporary electric fence and 
unspools a hot wire. Willow Wieskamp, the hired hand, stamps in fence 
posts. Wendy seeded a rye-wheat hybrid called triticale here last 
October, and the ungrazed grass is already over knee-high. Between the 
three of them, they move the fence daily, aiming to graze roughly half 
of the grass before moving on. The cows ramble over, lowing for the new 
feed.</p>
<p class="">As Wendy and Wieskamp set up the fence, Korey pushes a shovel into the ground and pries up a blade of soil.</p>
<p class="">“These roots are extruding sugars to feed the [soil] biology
 … like mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria,” he says, breaking apart a mass 
of roots and earth with his hands. “We’re really short on the fungi 
part, because we killed all that with the chemicals over the last 40 
years of farming. We just hammered and hammered and hammered on it.”</p>
<p class="">The Fauques (pronounced “Fauks”) are using regenerative 
practices to turn that around. The tiny world of roots, earthworms and 
insects crumbling through Korey’s fingers is evidence it’s working. 
Aiming to improve fertility and biodiversity and<a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/regenerative-annual-cropping"> capture carbon, they </a>use many of the same techniques as Wicks and Givens, <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/regenerative-annual-cropping">with one main difference: Instead of tilling to </a>fight weeds, the Fauques spray herbicide, albeit much less than a typical conventional grower. </p>
<p class="">Korey, 43, grew up on the ranch, and attended school in 
Sunburst, population 360. After graduating from MSU Northern in Havre, 
he worked as an agronomist at an agricultural co-op in Cut Bank, 
scouting farmer’s fields, sampling soil and advising on fertilizer 
ratios and herbicides. That’s where he met Wendy, 44, then the co-op’s 
finance manager and commodities broker. Raised on a Nebraska cattle 
ranch, Wendy moved to Montana after earning a masters degree in 
agricultural economics and agribusiness from the University of Wyoming. 
They married in 2003, purchased a crop insurance business, and soon 
added agrochemical sales and consulting to their portfolio. When Korey’s
 dad retired in 2012, they took over what’s now Happy Steer Ranch.</p>
<figcaption class="">Korey Fauque holds a chunk of soil from the 
5,000-acre Happy Steer Ranch, a crop and cattle operation south of 
Sunburst that he shares with his wife, Wendy. The Fauques are using 
regenerative agricultural techniques to improve their soil health, which
 Korey says was “hammered” by conventional practices that relied on 
heavy pesticide and fertilizer use over the last 40 years. <span>Credit: Jason Thompson / MTFP</span></figcaption><p class="">Starting
 out, they followed the standard practice of alternating wheat and 
barley with “chem fallow,” which means they grew a crop one year and 
then killed everything with Roundup and left it unplanted the following 
year. After that, they planted directly into the old crop residue with a
 “no-till drill” that slices diagonally into the soil and inserts seeds 
directly into old crop residue. Because there were no live crops using 
water during the fallow year, the method preserved soil moisture, 
essentially giving the next year’s crop two seasons’ worth of water. </p>
<p class="">No-till has been common on dryland farms in Montana since 
Roundup became readily available in the state in the 1990s. It replaced 
tilled fallow, in which farmers plowed last year’s crops under and left a
 field of bare dirt. At the time, chem fallow/no-till was considered 
revolutionary because it reduced erosion by leaving the dead straw in 
place and eliminated plowing. </p>
<p class="">At first, the Fauques sprayed 16 ounces per acre, but as the
 weeds became resistant they bumped up to 24 ounces, and then a quart. 
Like Wicks and Givens, they drew the line at Paraquat. </p>
<p class="">Around that time, their neighbor Griff Bye was one of the 
first in the area to experiment with cover crops and integrating 
livestock, and he often stopped by to talk about what he was trying. In 
those conversations, the Fauques realized they could improve the soil by
 planting pulses or cover crops, and make money by grazing those same 
cover crops, instead of spending so much on Roundup. After attending a 
Natural Resources Conservation Service training and watching soil health
 videos on YouTube, they stopped fallowing and began planting legumes 
and cover crop, and reducing pesticides and fertilizer. Five years in, 
soil sampling showed increased organic matter and microbial life. Next 
they devised a mobile water trough that pumped water to their cover crop
 plots and native pastures, allowing them to move their cattle daily, a 
practice known as intensive grazing. In 2019, they switched to a 
smaller, hardier breed, Aberdeen Angus, and began calving in late spring
 instead of winter to reduce stress on the animals. Now, they’re 
planting pollinator strips to attract birds and insects like bees, which
 are integral to crop farming but in <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/11761/chapter/5#79">decline, in part due to pesticide use</a>.</p>
<p class="">“The more you start trying stuff, the more you want to try stuff to get it turned around,” Wendy said.</p>
<h3 class="">AN IMPERFECT SOLUTION </h3>
<p class="">Even when used minimally, tillage and pesticides both come with clear downsides. But<a href="https://modernfarmer.com/2019/10/the-elusive-goal-of-no-till-organic/"> no one has figured out how to completely eliminate either at scale and over time</a>,
 a goal Korey calls the “Holy Grail.” With new technology and research —
 including a current MSU study on naturally occurring weed pathogens 
based on<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znVDgle8tM0&amp;t=162s"> a similar biocontrol project in Kenya</a> — a no-till organic system might one day be possible.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In the meantime, public interest in regenerative agriculture is <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0030727021998063">growing rapidly</a>. Around since the 1970s, the term only recently became<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0030727021998063"> part of the lexicon</a>. </p>

 media coverage has increased dramatically in the last two years, as 
private companies and now the Biden administration consider paying 
farmers to capture carbon as part of carbon markets. Alongside that 
rising profile come critiques. Skeptics are raising concerns ranging 
from the<a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/regenerative-agriculture-good-soil-health-limited-potential-mitigate-climate-change"> limited scientific proof of carbon capture rates</a> to the<a href="https://civileats.com/2019/10/29/big-food-is-betting-on-regenerative-agriculture-to-thwart-climate-change/"> potential for greenwashing</a> and the barriers to<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2019.00096/full"> Black, Indigenous, migrant, women and other minority farmers who are integral</a> for regenerative agriculture to thrive in the long run.</p>
<p class="">As the movement lurches forward nationwide, the Fauques are a
 decade into their own regenerative experiment. They say they’re growing
 more crops with less rain and applying 70% less pesticide. This year 
they replaced granular fertilizer with compost extract, though they’re 
still using liquid nitrogen. (“Soil is like an addict,” Wendy said. 
“Once it becomes dependent on nitrogen and you’ve killed all the good 
bugs, you can’t grow a crop without nitrogen.”) They have fewer weeds 
than ever and went from doctoring more than 10% of their calves to 
almost none. By direct-marketing their grass-finished beef, they make a 
better profit than they did when they shipped calves to a feedlot. </p>
<p class="">But it’s not all bumper crops and roses. </p>
<p class="">It can be harder to find used equipment for regenerative 
practices, and as with all agriculture, equipment costs are 
astronomical. When they try something different like<a href="https://www.sare.org/publications/crop-rotation-on-organic-farms/guidelines-for-intercropping/"> intercropping</a>,
 in which they plant two or more symbiotic crops together, they often 
can’t insure it because of strict federal crop insurance regulations, 
even as owners of their own crop insurance agency. They also get 
negative comments on social media, usually when a more traditional 
operator takes offense at the Fauques comparing their new practices to 
conventional ones.</p>
<p class="">“We all did the same thing, [but] if you’re the person still doing those practices, it’s hard to not get offended,” Korey said. </p>
<p class="">Regenerative systems are known for <a href="https://www.csuchico.edu/regenerativeagriculture/demos/gabe-brown.shtml">building topsoil quickly</a>.
 But it’s slow going in an arid environment like the Golden Triangle, 
which historically averaged 10 to 15 inches of moisture a year. Happy 
Steer Ranch, which is dry even for the Triangle, has averaged eight 
inches annually during the Fauques’ tenure. While they saw noticeable 
improvement of their soil structure in 2020, they’re predicting less 
improvement this year with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mt-state-wire-montana-lifestyle-business-government-and-politics-98ed6f159876d59c323e35e0e1cdcf3e">the drought</a>. </p>
<p class="">“It was easier to farm the way we were farming [before],” Wendy said.</p>
<figcaption class="">John Wicks planting organic barley at Tiber Ridge Farm in June 2021. <span>Credit: Jason Thompson / MTFP</span></figcaption><p class="">Still,
 they estimate that about 50% of operators in Toole County are adopting 
regenerative practices on at least part of their land. Some are doing it
 because they can’t afford synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, Korey 
said, while others are responding to herbicide-resistant weeds. In 
addition, Korey says, a new generation of young farmers recently 
returned to the area, and many are open to trying new things.</p>
<p class="">Ultimately, the Fauques want to retool the framework of 
their direct-market beef business for crops. They sell 90% of their beef
 to local customers in Sunburst and Shelby, and their new idea is to 
market legumes and grains directly to consumers as well, using 
nutrient-density as a selling point. But they suspect finding demand to 
match their large supply will be a challenge, and they’ve yet to find a 
reliable nutrient test. They also hope to stock organic biological 
supplements in place of the fertilizers and pesticides they currently 
sell out of their retail warehouse, employing their salesman to sell 
compost extract, humic acid and worm castings instead.</p>
<p class="">“I think ag is headed that way, but there’s so much money in
 the chemicals and fertilizer and in the way things are done that it’s 
hard to get away from that and figure out how to find those markets,” 
Wendy said. “At least right now we’re figuring out a way to improve our 
ground and our animals’ health. And I think it’ll eventually pay us back
 — even if it’s not financially — if we can just keep making a living 
and producing better products.”</p>
