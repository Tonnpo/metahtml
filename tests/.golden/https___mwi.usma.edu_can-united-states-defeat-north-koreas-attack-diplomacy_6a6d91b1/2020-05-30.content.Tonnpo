<h1 class="rm-manual">How Can the United States Defeat North Korea’s “Attack Diplomacy”?</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://mwi.usma.edu/author/t-s-allen/" rel="author">T.S. Allen</a> and <a href="https://mwi.usma.edu/author/luke-j-schumacher/" rel="author">Luke J. Schumacher</a> | June 13, 2018 </p>
<p>President Donald Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un met this week in
 Singapore for the first summit between American and North Korean heads 
of state. While the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/opinions/trump-kim-us-north-korea-summit-reactions-opinion/index.html">response among observers</a>
 has ranged from cautious optimism through skepticism to outright 
criticism, there is little doubt that the summit signals a momentous sea
 change in US-North Korean relations and has the potential to 
significantly alter—for better or worse—one of the world’s most 
longstanding security challenges. Whether it raises the real prospect of
 peace and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula is far from certain.
 But there are important aspects of the summit and any subsequent 
diplomatic developments that should be examined now. The joint 
declaration issued in Singapore, for instance—which avoided specifying 
what exactly denuclearization will entail—is simply the first step on 
what will at best be a long road to peace. The history of North Korean 
diplomacy suggests that the much more difficult task confronting the 
United States and North Korea still lies ahead, as diplomatic 
professionals hammer out the details of a deal, implement it, and 
enforce its provisions. As the two sides flesh out the details of the 
agreement committed to in Singapore, US negotiators will have to counter
 North Korean “attack diplomacy” to make a deal that will last and 
achieve its objectives.</p>
<p>Even before the summit occurred, many analysts wrote it off as yet 
another iteration of the classic pattern of Korean diplomacy, in which 
North Korea offers the promise of a nuclear-free peninsula only to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=055wFyO6gag">snatch away the opportunity</a>
 to secure it at the last moment, often by reneging on a deal it agreed 
to. North Korea did this in 1985, when it signed the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty despite never intending to abide by its 
stipulations. North Korea did it again in 2008, when it went as far as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3UnhTDuQQc">blowing up</a>
 portions of a nuclear plant in partial fulfillment of a deal before 
resuming uranium enrichment shortly thereafter. In 2012, North Korea 
promised to halt missile tests but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IzRt38xSYA">launched</a>
 a “satellite” into space less than two months later, sinking the 
so-called Leap Day agreement with the United States. And most recently, 
when North Korea blew up its Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site late last 
month to demonstrate it was ready for another round of denuclearization 
talks, skeptics imagined Lucy again <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=055wFyO6gag">holding a football</a> for Charlie Brown.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Trump-Kim summit may just be the first step to breaking this pattern. The two leaders released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/joint-statement-president-donald-j-trump-united-states-america-chairman-kim-jong-un-democratic-peoples-republic-korea-singapore-summit/">joint statement</a> affirming their dedication to continued diplomacy. While previous deals have resulted in <a href="https://www.38north.org/2011/03/1992-joint-declaration/">similar declarations</a>
 and later failed, there is reason to remain cautiously optimistic about
 the latest round of diplomacy since there is a real chance that US and 
North Korean interests are finally close enough to make a deal despite 
the chronic lack of trust between the two parties. North Korea’s 
application of its trademark brand of diplomacy so far has been merely a
 less intense version of its typical bombast. And the Trump 
administration’s approaches to North Korea, from “maximum pressure, 
maximum engagement” to walking away from the summit once before it 
finally occurred, have been mostly successful in outmaneuvering North 
Korea’s diplomatic histrionics.</p>
<p>Pyongyang is not an easy partner to make a deal with, primarily owing
 to a unique approach to diplomacy that North Koreans call “attack 
diplomacy.” The use of diplomacy to manipulate Americans is a point of 
pride for North Koreans, and their <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Cleanest_Race.html?id=kYn4eE3uSIQC">propaganda</a> gloats over their aptitude for duplicity and ability to “trick the Yankees.”</p>
<p>Such manipulation only matters if North Korea is negotiating in bad 
faith. Unfortunately, North Korea is probably more likely to enter into 
diplomatic negotiations in bad faith than any other state. According to 
North Korean poet laureate-turned-defector Jang Jin-sung, Kim Jong-un’s 
father, Kim Jong-il, even <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Dear_Leader.html?id=0EqGAwAAQBAJ">told</a>
 his diplomats: “Diplomacy is a counter-intelligence operation.” Its 
purpose, at least under the elder Kim, was to use words to buy time for 
North Korea to continue to build its nuclear weapons. Jang elaborates:</p>
<p>North Korea uses dialogue as a tool of deception rather than of 
negotiation, with the objective being the maintenance of the misplaced 
trust of the other party. And why not? North Korea’s opacity is its 
greatest strength. It allows things to be done on its own terms while 
other countries continue to take what North Korea says at face value.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this history does not guarantee North Korea is 
negotiating in bad faith now. Its most recent rhetorical attacks on 
joint US-South Korean military drills are simply par for the course. In 
fact, after President Trump initially canceled the summit, reports 
indicate Kim <a href="http://english.dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=15222&amp;cataId=nk01500">expressed</a>
 outrage at the “highly offensive comments” his officials made, 
instructing them to exchange such “outdated diplomacy practices” for a 
new, and apparently less combative, “creative diplomacy.” More telling 
still is that the North Korean People’s Army resisted firing ballistic 
missiles into the Sea of Japan this year, which is the typical kinetic 
complement to the regime’s bombast. Most significantly of all, Kim’s own
 domestic rhetoric has been <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/yes-north-korea-will-give-its-nukes-kim-jong-un-crying-prove-26223?page=show">focused on the economy</a>,
 which he could significantly improve by striking a lasting deal with 
the United States and South Korea. While these are uncertain indicators 
of North Korean intent, there’s no reason to write off the possibility 
that North Korea is looking for a deal. Pre-negotiation attack diplomacy
 may be public, but it is also mostly harmless and often a poor 
representation of the regime’s strategic aims.</p>
<p>The essence and strength of North Korean attack diplomacy is its use 
of strategic ambiguity to create diplomatic outcomes that North Korea 
can later manipulate when a deal is implemented. The decisive phase of 
any deal with the North Koreans is not the diplomacy leading up to the 
deal—or even the high-profile diplomatic engagements—but the 
implementation phase in which they re-negotiate the meaning of the 
written agreement. After Pyongyang sets the stage for diplomacy with 
false promises, provocations, and threats, it historically negotiates 
using lies and deceit, and then marginalizes the relevance of diplomacy 
by ignoring many of the agreements it signs once it has received the 
concessions it seeks. It is a blunt, effective, but predictable 
approach. Precisely because this is the North Koreans’ pattern for all 
diplomacy with the United States, we shouldn’t be surprised if we later 
discover this is what is occurring. It is simply their way of hedging 
their bets.</p>
<p>Attack diplomacy continues at the negotiating table. North Korean diplomats <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=sYf0APUrQ2MC&amp;q=kojip#v=snippet&amp;q=kojip&amp;f=false">frequently</a>
 begin negotiations with hardline and bellicose statements and, if they 
think negotiations are proceeding poorly, continue with an unyielding 
attitude and an unwillingness to compromise. This was not on display at 
the summit, as Kim Jong-un plays by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-was-jocular-and-at-ease-at-boozy-banquet-1520606867">different rules</a>
 than his subordinates, but it will likely manifest during future 
working-level meetings where it matters most. At the same time, North 
Korean stubbornness is no insurmountable obstacle. The United States has
 achieved detailed negotiated agreements with North Korea in the past.</p>
<p>The reason those deals failed time and again is that North Korea 
unilaterally abandoned each of them. In the past, after North Korea 
received the aid it needed or averted a possible preemptive US strike, 
it simply announced the deals were no longer valid, often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/25/international/asia/north-korea-says-it-now-possesses-nuclear-arsenal.html">quite baldly</a>.
 There is nothing new about this approach. As Adm. C. Turner Joy—who 
negotiated the armistice that ceased open hostilities in the Korean War 
in 1953—put it in his <a href="https://archive.org/details/howcommunistsneg008190mbp">memoir</a>,
 Negotiating With Communists, “Communists are not embarrassed in the 
least to deny an agreement already reached . . . [and] simply state your
 interpretation is an incorrect one.”</p>
<p>Overall, then, North Korean diplomacy before and after the summit is 
proceeding according to a standard pattern, which gives us no remarkable
 reasons to be hopeful, but few reasons to be alarmed either. Attack 
diplomacy is an inconvenience, not a threat. Given the apparent 
dedication of both President Trump and his North Korean counterpart to 
making a deal, it seems likely they will continue to move toward a 
signed, detailed agreement on “denuclearization” in Korea. That’s when 
the real art of the deal begins. A deal will only prove durable—as 
previous deals with North Korea have not—if it is based on compatible 
interests. “Win-win” scenarios rely more on interest than on trust, 
after all. The key question is: Can the United States and North Korea 
reconcile their different definitions of denuclearization, sign a deal, 
and actually stick to it?</p>
<p>Although both parties agree that the way forward is “denuclearization,” there is <a href="https://www.38north.org/2018/06/0605jwitreprint/">no common definition</a>
 of the term between them. North Korea probably prefers it that way, as 
it is relatively more flexible and ambiguity benefits Pyongyang. America
 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/20/asia/kim-trump-moon-denuclearization-intl/index.html">has long called for</a>
 the “complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement” (or CVID) of 
North Korea’s nuclear weapons and the architecture that produced them. 
North Korea, meanwhile, advocates for a gradual and phased 
“denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” and this language made it 
into the joint Trump-Kim statement. In its proposed quid pro quo—<a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/28/c_137070598.htm">championed</a> by Kim Jong-un but first <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-north-kim/kim-jong-il-says-wants-denuclearization-of-peninsula-idUSTRE50M0Z020090123">articulated</a>
 by his father, Kim Jong-il—North Korea will progressively reduce its 
nuclear capabilities, while US leaders and allies encourage such efforts
 by exhibiting “good will,” contributing to “an atmosphere of peace and 
stability,” and pursuing “progressive and synchronous measures” to help 
realize complete denuclearization.</p>
<p>In the best possible scenario for North Korea, those “progressive and
 synchronous measures” provide a security guarantee that eliminates 
North Korea’s need for the nuclear deterrent. In the past, North Koreans
 have argued that sustaining “good will” requires the United States to 
collapse its “nuclear umbrella” protecting South Korea, end its “hostile
 policy” to the North by signing a peace treaty formally concluding the 
Korean War, normalize diplomatic relations, loosen economic sanctions, 
and withdraw the 30,000 US soldiers who currently reinforce South 
Korea’s security. In short, North Korea wants a deal that rebalances the
 Korean security environment in its favor, negating the country’s 
supposed justification for needing nuclear weapons. President Trump has 
already demonstrated some “good will” in his stated commitment to cancel
 the semiannual, joint US-South Korean military drills, which North 
Korea has long referred to as “invasion rehearsals” and evidence of 
America’s “hostile policy.” Likewise, there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/world/asia/north-korea-south-treaty.html">strong indications</a>
 that North and South Korea may sign a peace treaty formally ending the 
Korean War. Even if North Korea agrees to CVID, it will almost certainly
 demand the same sort of concessions it has demanded in exchange for the
 “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”</p>
<p>There are three ways the United States and North Korea might 
reconcile their visions of denuclearization and build a lasting deal. 
First, North Korea could decide that it really is better off without 
nuclear weapons and acquiesce to CVID. Many theorists contend, however, 
that that there is no single incentive—or combination of political, 
economic, and security concessions—powerful enough to convince a lonely 
despot trapped between multiple great powers that he is somehow safer 
without nuclear weapons. North Korea <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/world/asia/north-korea-statement-trump.html">learned</a>
 from the fall of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 2003, and the subsequent 
overthrow of Libya’s Muammar Gadaffi in 2011, that dictators who give up
 their nuclear weapons programs are eventually toppled. (The Trump 
administration’s several, pre-summit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/us/politics/bolton-libya-north-korea-trump.html">invocations of the “Libya model”</a>
 served as a useful reminder on the lesson, too.) The ultimate purpose 
of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program is to protect North Korea from 
the United States and South Korea, which together pose an <a href="https://mwi.usma.edu/war-north-korea-wants/">existential threat</a>
 to the Kim regime. While the current South Korean administration is 
friendly to the North, South Korean conservatives are not and could 
return to power as soon as 2022. South Korea still appoints <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_the_Five_Northern_Korean_Provinces">shadow governors</a> for every North Korean province. The North’s nuclear weapons all but guarantee that the South Koreans cannot resume the war.</p>
<p>Second, there is a nonzero chance that North Korea perceives the 
People’s Republic of China as a greater threat to its long-term 
interests than South Korea. Kim Jong-il, for example, considered China 
the greatest threat to North Korea, and <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Dear_Leader.html?id=jo1KBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q=ideological%20border&amp;f=false">called</a>
 the Yalu River separating China from Korea “an ideological border, just
 like the 38th parallel.” After current Chinese ruler Xi Jinping took 
power in 2012, Sino-North Korean relations sunk to an all-time low and 
North Korea began <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/yes-north-korea-will-give-its-nukes-kim-jong-un-crying-prove-26223?page=show">conducting</a>
 nuclear and missile tests during major Chinese-hosted international 
summits, which undermined China’s leadership role. Today, while the 
United States aims to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf">balance</a> China’s rise in Asia, South Korea is <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2018-05-16/deciphering-kim-jong-uns-motives?cid=nlc-fa_twofa-20180517">uniquely</a>
 amenable to building new ties with the North. Meanwhile, China is 
increasingly aggressive and powerful. Kim Jong-un could feel more 
threatened by the millions of soldiers in the Chinese People’s 
Liberation Army than he does by the 30,000 American soldiers in Korea. 
If that’s the case, he may be looking to make an unprecedented deal in 
which he not only defuses tensions, but strategically aligns with the 
United States and South Korea. If he did, it would <a href="http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100125840">certainly not</a>
 be the first time a materially weaker state betrayed an ally to join a 
balancing coalition against a more proximal threat aspiring to regional 
hegemony. Given a liberal pro-engagement government in Seoul’s Blue 
House and a maverick in Washington’s White House, the summit may just 
have provided the high-stakes platform Kim needed to make an otherwise 
improbable strategic defection. While China supports North Korean 
denuclearization, the longtime North Korean lifeline was not a party to 
the summit, making it a unique opportunity for North Korea to strike a 
deal with the United States without direct Chinese interference. Despite
 displays of <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2018/0509/c90000-9457811.html">friendly relations</a>, Chinese strategists worry North Korea could be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/10/world/asia/trump-kim-korea-china.html">preparing</a> to turn on them.</p>
<p>The third way the United States and North Korea might get to a 
denuclearization deal is by softening the definition of CVID. In the 
past, stringent verification requirements have stalled denuclearization 
efforts in North Korea. If history serves as any guide, the North 
Koreans’ distrust of Washington, the International Atomic Energy Agency,
 and the international community means they are likely unwilling to 
agree to an intrusive inspection regime. But CVID is practically 
impossible without a verification regime that is both immediate and 
intrusive. Instead, the United States could seek a softer deal, in which
 it grants concessions or aid in exchange for measures that prevent 
North Korea from employing its alleged capability to launch a 
nuclear-armed missile at the US homeland. Trading concessions for time 
and trust may allow the deal—or future ones—to prevent North Korea from 
producing additional nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of such a deal are numerous. Above all, it gives 
North Korea a chance to simply walk away once it has gained the 
immediate benefits of the deal, as it has done so many times before. And
 in the absence of verification, a meaningful deal relies on <a href="http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/StructuralRealism.pdf">trust</a>—something in short supply not just between the United States and North Korea, but between all states.</p>
<p>Overall, the greatest obstacles confronting both sides as they try to
 secure the deal they have now promised to seek have less to do with 
combative negotiating tactics and more to do with stubborn geopolitical 
realities. At the same time, these realities are as they are perceived 
to be by either party. The situation is far from hopeless but does have a
 looming <a href="http://www.armyupress.army.mil/journals/military-review/online-exclusive/2017-online-exclusive-articles/north-korea-policy/">expiration date</a>.
 We do not know exactly what North Korea wants since we still do not 
know exactly what the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” means, 
itself a deliberate effect of attack diplomacy in action. North Korea 
does not boast a proven track record of abiding by international 
agreements, but it can adhere to a deal in its own best interests like 
any other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-missile-programs-rational.html">rational state</a>.
 The challenge confronting the president and his team will be 
negotiating an agreement that makes both sides want to keep the deal.</p>
