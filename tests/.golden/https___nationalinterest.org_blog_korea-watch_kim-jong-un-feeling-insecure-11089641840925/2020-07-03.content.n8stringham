<h1 class="rm-manual">Is Kim Jong-un Feeling Insecure? </h1>
<p class="rm-manual">Why did Kim allow the party plenary report to 
replace his traditional New Year’s Address? As with many things in North
 Korea, we do not know, forcing us to speculate. At least one 
possibility is that Kim Jong-un fears that his pattern of failures in 
2019 has significantly undermined his position as the god of North 
Korea.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span>by <a href="file:///profile/bruce-w-bennett">Bruce W. Bennett</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/bwbennett?lang=en"> <span>Follow @bwbennett on Twitter</span> <span>L</span> </a> </span> </p>
<p>Korea watchers have been surprised that North Korean leader Kim 
Jong-un failed to provide a 2020 New Year’s address, as he has done in 
the past. Instead, he has apparently substituted, without explanation, a
 <a href="https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1577829999-473709661/report-on-5th-plenary-meeting-of-7th-c-c-wpk/">report of the North Korean Workers’ Party Plenary meeting</a> completed on December 31.</p>
<p>This report continues the North Korean regime’s long-term pattern of 
characterizing the United States as the enemy of the North Korean 
people. It characterizes the United States as waging a cruel war against
 the North Korean people. This is not new, the North Korean regime has 
long sought to portray the United States as a scapegoat for many of the 
regime’s failures. It also allows the regime to rally the North Korean 
people to achieve victory against their enemy.</p>
<p>And thus the North Korea regime has once again justified and 
explained itself by using deception. Indeed, North Korea has described 
itself as a “workers’ paradise” when in reality North Korean workers 
live an impoverished life while suffering from brutal political control.
 The report includes other deception such as claiming that the North 
Korean public health system is, “best in the world…,” an extreme 
deception. The North Korean regime appears to use such deceptions to 
maintain control and avoid internal dissent. </p>
<p>The specifics of the North Korean regime’s deceptions, intermingled 
with some truth, offer important insights on the regime’s thinking and 
attitude toward the United States and toward North Korean 
denuclearization. The regime’s deceptive vilification of the United 
States reflects the regime’s paranoia: “The DPRK-U.S. stand-off which 
has lasted century after century…”, the U.S. has applied “the most 
brutal and inhuman sanctions … over the past seven decades,” and the 
U.S. has made North Korea the “‘…target of its preemptive nuclear 
strike…’” </p>
<p>Of course, the biggest deception is that the sanctions and pressure 
on North Korea are solely from the North’s claimed enemy, the United 
States. The report never once mentions the United Nations having 
implemented many of the sanctions on North Korea, or that the sanctions 
are punishments for rogue behavior that, if terminated, would lead to 
sanctions removal. Kim cannot let his people know that the international
 community, and not just the United States, find his provocations 
unacceptable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the key question is whether North Korea is prepared to 
make the nuclear weapon versus sanctions tradeoff. The report suggests 
that Kim is not: “If there were not the nuclear issue, the U.S. would 
find fault with us under other issue, and the U.S. military and 
political threats would not end.” “He solemnly declared that there is no
 need to hesitate with any expectation of the U.S. lift of sanctions...”
 The United States seeks “to completely strangle and stifle the DPRK.” 
Indeed, the report says that “the U.S. is raising demands....” </p>
<p>The United States may be increasing sanctions, but its key demand remains the same: North Korean denuclearization, exactly as <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/on.jsp?a=1114009586911&amp;r=3&amp;c=4c072b20-7764-11e3-9f23-d4ae529a8786&amp;d=1130158353988&amp;ch=4ca8c250-7764-11e3-9fb6-d4ae529a8786&amp;ca=7df9c55c-88f1-4bee-bf9e-1c866dbff826&amp;o=https://imgssl.constantcontact.com/ui/images1/s.gifhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/world/asia/north-korea-south-nuclear-weapons.html">Kim offered when in March 2018 he asked for a summit meeting with President Trump</a>. In the <a href="http://english1.president.go.kr/BriefingSpeeches/Speeches/32">April 27 2018 Panmunjom Declaration</a>, Kim committed to the full denuclearization called for in the earlier <a href="https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/KR%20KP_920120_JointDeclarationDenuclearizationKoreanPeninsula.pdf">1992 Denuclearization Declaration</a>
 which says the South and North will “not test, manufacture, produce, 
receive, possess, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons” or “possess 
nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities.” The North 
Korean regime is in extreme violation of this element of the Panmunjom 
Agreement, having probably doubled its nuclear weapon destructive 
potential since March 2018 while eliminating no nuclear weapons or 
production facilities.</p>
<p>What are the implications for the United States and the international community? The North wants <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/22/782130822/north-korea-to-end-negotiations-if-u-s-doesnt-offer-concessions-by-years-end">major U.S. concessions before it will even negotiate again</a>.
 Yet the balance sheet of U.S. concessions since March 2018 vastly 
overwhelms the North Korean concessions, especially since the North has 
reneged on many of them. In a democracy like the United States, 
President Trump has gone about as far as he can go in giving North Korea
 unrequited concessions. </p>
<p>The North Korean regime does not seem to understand this. Instead, it
 appears prepared to launch a coercive campaign to secure more 
concessions, while offering little or nothing in return. The report 
threatens that the North will restart its missile and nuclear weapon 
tests, which of course it has already partially done with 25 missile 
tests in 2019. The report threatens to demonstrate a “new strategic 
weapon” in the near future. Such a demonstration could lead to an 
unwanted escalation spiral.</p>
<p>This report is, of course, another element in the North’s information
 campaign against the United States and South Korea. One of the biggest 
concessions the U.S./ROK have made to North Korea is to minimally 
respond to the North’s information campaign. This approach has left many
 people in the region confused by the North Korean deceptions that have 
not been countered, suggesting that the deceptions could be true. One of
 the best ways for the U.S./ROK to respond to the report’s threats could
 be to enhance their information operations, seeking to explain the 
North Korean deceptions. </p>
<p>In the end, a key question is: why did Kim allow the party plenary 
report to replace his traditional New Year’s Address? As with many 
things in North Korea, we do not know, forcing us to speculate. At least
 one possibility is that Kim Jong-un fears that his pattern of failures 
in 2019 has significantly undermined his position as the god of North 
Korea. He may have concluded that the statements made even by the rubber
 stamp Workers Party Plenary would be more authoritative than his own 
address. This is not to say that there is serious instability in North 
Korea, but rather that Kim Jong-un may be worried about the possibility 
of such instability. If this is true, Kim may be prepared to take more 
serious risks in the future because he is worrying about losing control 
of North Korea. This would potentially be very dangerous.</p>
