<h1 class="rm-manual"> Coronavirus Prompts Fed to Slash Interest Rate - Stocks Slide, Gold Spikes, Bitcoin Uncertainty</h1>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by 50 bps on Tuesday 
citing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak against the bleak 
economy. The last time the central bank slashed rates by leveraging an 
“emergency rate shift” by half a percentage point was after Lehman 
Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The announcement didn’t have a 
favorable effect on the stock market and the Dow shed close to 800 
points after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced the cut.</p>

<h2>50 bps: The Federal Reserve’s First Emergency Rate Cut Since 2008</h2>
<p>It’s safe to say that global markets have been shaken by the 
coronavirus crisis and governments and central banks worldwide are 
reacting. Last week U.S. stock markets were extremely bloody and assets 
like precious metals and cryptocurrencies took a hit too. On Monday the 
Dow Industrial Jones saw a 1,200-point advance as it seemed like a 
recovery was on the cards.</p>
<figcaption>After the Fed announced slashing the interest rate, the top 
three indices dropped like a rock. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw 
close to 800 points shed almost erasing the 1,200 points it gained on 
Monday.</figcaption><p>However, on Tuesday as coronavirus fears continued to extend across the globe, the U.S. Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/economy/federal-reserve-rate-cut/index.html">cut interest rates by 50 bps</a>
 and explained it was due to the coronavirus crisis and the overall 
“outlook” of the economy. Almost immediately after the Fed’s 
announcement, all three major stock indices dropped significantly 
percentage-wise and the Dow lost close to 800 points.</p>
<p>“We saw the risk to the outlook to the economy and chose to act,” 
Powell told reporters on Tuesday. “I don’t think anybody knows how long 
it will be,” he added. “I know the US economy is strong and we’ll get to
 the other side of this and return to solid growth and a solid labor 
market as well.”</p>
<figcaption>“The magnitude and persistence of the overall effect on the 
U.S. economy remain highly uncertain and the situation remains a fluid 
one,” Powell said on Tuesday. “Against this background, the committee 
judged that the risks to the U.S. outlook have changed materially. In 
response, we have eased the stance of monetary policy to provide some 
more support to the economy.”</figcaption><h2>Lehman Brothers Crash, 9/11, and ‘Undermined Confidence’</h2>
<p>Since September 2019, the Fed has been feeding private banks with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-considers-creating-a-separate-entity-for-cash-injections/">billions</a> in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-officials-ponder-funding-hedge-funds-and-private-brokers-directly/">overnight repos</a>
 and it has cut rates three times already but not nearly as much as 
Tuesday. In fact, the last time the Fed cut rates by half a percentage 
point was during the 2008 economic crisis. One month before the 
“emergency rate shift” on September 15, 2008, the U.S. saw the largest 
bankruptcy in the country’s history. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed
 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the Fed decided to take action. Roughly 
three weeks later on October 8, 2008, the Fed used an emergency rate 
shift and cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) to 1.5%. “The Committee 
took this action in light of evidence pointing to a weakening of 
economic activity and a reduction in inflationary pressures,” the 
Federal Open Market Committee explained at the time.</p>
<p>Of course, the Fed did more than just that as they opened the 
floodgates of quantitative easing and stimulated private banks while the
 taxpayers had to foot the bill. 2008 saw <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-was-the-bank-bailout-bill-3305675">massive bank bailouts</a>
 and the Fed ultimately slashed the interest rate as low as 0.25%. Prior
 to the Lehman Brothers collapse, the Fed cut rates on January 22, 2008 
by 75 bps and 50 bps in August 2007.</p>
<figcaption>The history of emergency rate cuts or unscheduled decisions made by the U.S. central bank between 2005 up until now.</figcaption><p>It was six years before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008">2008 financial crisis</a>
 when the central bank slashed interest rates by 50 bps because of the 
9/11 attacks. On September 17, 2001, a few days after the World Trade 
Center bombings, the Fed told the public the central bank would offer 
“unusually large volumes of liquidity.” The Fed’s interest rate cut of 
50 bps on Tuesday didn’t have much of a favorable outcome on the New 
York Stock Exchange and Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi 
said it “undermined confidence.”</p>
<p>“Cutting rates was the right policy choice, certainly the right thing
 to do, but doing it the way they did was a mistake,” Zandi <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moodys-mark-zandi-calls-fed-rate-cut-timing-a-mistake-215058448.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvL3pmT1RaNUJKWm4_YW1wPTE&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGJn3fVmAeFp7UfgpVbJeCaF-yJIKO1FBR83OUafBi1OhAeN9_A37fcx6esG_RlvOb7M2Q7DDJN2BBEJhVLz6-QbgthFaOkjV-Mk-xgJyiBdAS708HuEU1P3Lh4HVgfnMxmxnTxz4jNMwbVYP9bS8p8Ew03bImKHekYDOjAkmFxM">explained</a>
 during an interview on Tuesday. “Certainly we know that in hindsight,” 
Zandi added. “It didn’t do what it was supposed to do and that was 
instill confidence. It, in fact, undermined confidence.”</p>
<figcaption>Mark Zandi is the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics and 
the cofounder of Economy.com. Zandi explained that the Fed’s rash 
decision to use an emergency rate cut didn’t do what it was supposed to 
do and instead “undermined confidence.”</figcaption><h2>Gold Prices Soar</h2>
<p>Following the Federal Reserve’s surprise interest rate cut on March 
3, the price of the precious metal gold surged by $49 on Tuesday to 
$1,638 an ounce. Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1234866279321919488">commented</a> on the Fed’s move and said: “Lower interest rates will do nothing to alter coronavirus related consumer behavior.”</p>
<figcaption>After gold rallied following the 50 bps rate cut, gold bug 
Peter Schiff commented on cryptocurrency markets. “If bitcoin can’t 
rally with an emergency 50 basis point rate cut, plus all of the recent 
stock, bond, currency, and gold market volatility, under what 
circumstances will it rally? If Bitcoin won’t go up, why own it? The 
answer to that question is ‘sell,'” <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1234947376722386945">Schiff tweeted on Tuesday.</a></figcaption><p>“The
 Fed’s real concern was the reverse wealth effect lower stock prices 
would have on consumers and the economy. So the rate cut was not really 
about the coronavirus, but the stock market,” Schiff added. Schiff also 
got some <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1235021574396231680">press</a>
 for predicting the current economic downturn and the 2008 financial 
crisis as well. While gold investors were pleased with the price of gold
 spiking after the Fed’s announcement, cryptocurrency markets remained 
lackluster.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrencies and Coronavirus</h2>
<p><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/">Crypto markets</a> did erase 
some gains on Tuesday but not nearly as close as the lift gold saw. 
While there are some people who believe a financial crisis would be good
 for <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">BTC</a> prices and the Fed’s surprise cut was a cherry on top, other speculators believe the opposite. A <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptokanoon/status/1234702786144690176">survey</a> from the Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptokanoon">Crypto Kanoon</a>
 says: “There is a common narrative floating in the industry that 
coronavirus will take the stock market down hence it will lead to [a] 
bitcoin pump. Is there a correlation between [the] stock market and 
crypto?” There are four answers that could be picked which include: 
“stocks up and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">BTC</a> down, stocks down and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">BTC</a>
 up, it is random, and no correlation.” With over 630 votes and more 
than 37.4%, the “no correlation” choice led the vote, but “stocks down 
and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">BTC</a> up” followed slightly behind.</p>
<p>Blockchain angel investor Qiao Wang also discussed <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">BTC</a>’s
 performance during a possible global recession. “Sorry to put a pin in 
the bubble, but Bitcoin traded like an absolute sh**coin over [the] last
 couple of weeks,” Wang <a href="https://twitter.com/qwqiao/status/1234956694154891265?s=21">tweeted</a>.
 “If you are a crypto business or hold a large amount of crypto, you 
should probably start thinking about hedging against a mild global 
recession.” Wang added:</p>
<p>Every short-term time frame I look at, be it 1 minute, hourly, or 
daily, Bitcoin looks depressingly correlated with [S&amp;P 500]. I’m not
 saying Bitcoin will necessarily get crushed by a mild recession, but 
you probably want to update your Bayesian probabilities.</p>
<figcaption>Many old school bitcoiners are talking about the 50 bps rate
 cut and the economy on Twitter. “I predict within 2-4 weeks we will 
see: record drops in economic markets, widespread quarantines in the 
U.S., all schools closed, over $100B in emergency government spending,” <a href="https://twitter.com/brucefenton/status/1235176052865019905">said Chainstone Labs’ Bruce Fenton</a>. “Possible nationalization of major industries and massive/unprecedented emergency measures,” Fenton added.</figcaption><p>Former
 Bitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton tweeted the situation as well.
 “I’d take some crypto off the table until this shakes out — Even 
Bitcoin will likely be hit by this — Long term fundamentals should be 
solid still,” Fenton <a href="https://twitter.com/brucefenton/status/1234966651042439168">stressed</a>.
 “The use case of limited supply money could be even more appealing. But
 a speculative and volatile asset will have a hard time,” he added. 
Still, there are many people that believe <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">BTC</a> will perform as well as gold has in the last few days or fulfill everyone’s uncorrelated asset theories.</p>
<p>“[S&amp;P 500] and Google Trends for ‘coronavirus’ are almost mirror 
images of each other – SPX is nearly completely tied to coronavirus fear
 — r = -0.9,” <a href="https://twitter.com/nsquaredcrypto/status/1235029780417761281">tweeted</a> Cane Island Alternative Advisors’ Timothy Peterson. “Bitcoin is [the] least correlated (-&gt; <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC">BTC</a> doesn’t care). Gold has been the best hedge: +0.6 correlation.”</p>
