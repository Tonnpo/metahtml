<p>Hundreds of millions of Americans are at home. Most of them don’t 
want to be. Simple choices about what to touch, where to walk and what 
to wear are fraught. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19-latest-news-2020-04-12/" rel="noopener noreferrer">More than 100,000 people have died worldwide,</a>
 and fears of how much more those numbers could grow have stopped much 
of daily life. But the bills have not stopped coming, though the 
paychecks in some cases have. We don’t know when it will end. It’s a 
recipe for anxiety, stress, and grief which puts more of us than ever 
before in a struggle to stay well. The regimen of physical hygiene is 
well-established: wash your hands; stay six feet away, cover your face. 
But the rules for good mental hygiene are not as clear. Psychologists 
told us that after Americans get past the worst of it, the worst of it 
may not be over. There may be mental health aftershocks. It’s hard to 
predict, and living with that unpredictability is part of the challenge.</p>
<p>John Dickerson: What does it feel like when that phone rings?</p>
<p>Francesca Santacroce: We run and we pick it up right away. And we’re 
just waiting. Just we don’t know what to expect. We don’t know if 
they’re going to tell us good news or bad news. We’re just really 
anxious about it.</p>
<figcaption><span>Francesca Santacroce</span></figcaption><p>Francesca 
Santacroce is describing the daily update from the hospital treating her
 father Joseph, a COVID-19 patient on a ventilator. Before the 
coronavirus hit her home in the close residential neighborhood of Staten
 Island, New York, her father took care of the family while Francesca 
worked in a doctor’s office, saving money for medical school. A 
23-year-old biomolecular sciences major, she is the first in her family 
to graduate college. But when we first interviewed her, at the approved 
distance, in her driveway two weeks ago, Francesca was shouldering her 
father’s duties, cooking, cleaning and caring for her 16-year-old 
sister, and mother, who needs five days a week of home dialysis. This 
video was shot by Francesca’s sister on a cellphone, after their mother 
was also diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Francesca Santacroce: I literally feel like I’m about to shatter in a
 million pieces right now. I feel like one wrong move and I’m going to 
break. And I’m going to fall apart. But I know that I can’t. I can’t do 
that. Because I need to take care of my family right now.</p>
<p>John Dickerson: You’ve been doing this now for a week…</p>
<p>Francesca Santacroce: Yeah.</p>
<p>John Dickerson: How long do you think it’s going to last?</p>
<p>Francesca Santacroce: We don’t know. The doctors don’t. We don’t 
know. And I don’t care how long it takes, as long as he comes home.</p>
<p>Uncertainty. Anguish and hope. In the age of coronavirus, it’s not 
just Francesca who is straining. The pandemic that has rocked her family
 has touched nearly every American life.</p>
<p>Daniel Kaplin: In the last few weeks, I think, COVID has dominated all my sessions.</p>
<figcaption><span>Daniel Kaplin</span></figcaption><p>Daniel Kaplin is 
president of the New York State Psychological Association and 
Francesca’s therapist. He spoke to us with her permission. </p>
<p>John Dickerson: Everybody’s racing to get back to their previous 
lives. But once that moment comes, what psychological effects of this do
 you think will linger?</p>
<p>Daniel Kaplin: I don’t think the world’s going to be the same. I 
think the loss of jobs– even after the virus is gone, people are still 
going to struggle. They’re going to struggle with, “How am I going to 
pay my rent, my mortgage? How am I going to feed my family?” So, it’s 
going to be an ongoing stressor for many people in this country.</p>
<p>John Dickerson: And there’s also a psychological benefit to doing productive work–</p>
<p>Daniel Kaplin: Sure. Right. What do you do when a person had their 
identity taken away from them because they no longer can work?</p>
<p>John Dickerson: Their identity taken away from them and then they 
can’t move about to replace that identity with any other useful, 
purposeful activity.</p>
<p>Daniel Kaplin: Absolutely. Yeah.</p>
<p>John Dickerson: It’s a double whammy.</p>
<p>Daniel Kaplin: Yeah. It is.</p>
<p>Days blend together when so much of what used to distinguish them has
 been paused. Bridge club is on hold. Graduation ceremonies are 
cancelled. This week’s religious services have been virtual. Those who 
live alone are vulnerable, particularly the elderly. But Kaplin says we 
must all fight against the blurring of the days by establishing a 
routine. </p>
<p>John Dickerson: What happens if you don’t have routine? </p>
<p>Daniel Kaplin: When you don’t have that structure, that routine– can,
 for some people, reduce their motivation to do the activities that they
 still need to do, but from home. And long term, they can become 
overwhelmed, “Oh, I’m not accomplishing my goals.” And then they could 
spiral into a depression.</p>
<p>Many of us look for connection in social media and the news, but too 
much of that can be harmful. A preliminary study done in China after the
 outbreak found that high social media exposure nearly doubled one’s 
chances of depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>Dr. Yuval Neria: We know already from previous disasters that ongoing
 anxiety during trauma is a huge risk factor for PTSD and depression in 
the long term. </p>
<p>Yuval Neria is the director of trauma and post traumatic stress 
disorder at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. He’s a former 
Israeli tank commander whose own traumatic experiences in the 1973 Yom 
Kippur War informed his career studying the brains of veterans with 
PTSD.</p>
<figcaption><span>Dr. Yuval Neria</span></figcaption><p>Dr. Yuval Neria: The brain is really obsessed about identification of fear, you know, of what is safe and what is dangerous.</p>
<p>John Dickerson: And what I wonder about though, there is the part of 
the brain that is always alive to fear. Part of the brain that says, 
“It’s okay, don’t be fearful, you’ve been through this before.” But 
we’ve never been through this before so…</p>
<p>Dr. Yuval Neria: Oh, that’s so true what you just said, because most 
of us don’t have a comparable memory or set of memories that can serve 
our understanding of what’s going on right now.</p>
<p>Neria led research and training efforts in New York in the aftermath 
of the 9/11 attacks, which has led him to be particularly concerned 
about the health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic.</p>
<p>Dr. Yuval Neria: I mean we saw that after 9/11. We saw how many first
 responders really left out without sufficient medical care and 
psychiatric care.</p>
<p>John Dickerson: In New York City, at 7 o’clock, people open their 
windows, they applaud. But then what happens when the clapping stops?</p>
<p>Dr. Yuval Neria: Right.</p>
<p>Neria estimates that after 9/11, 1% to 5% of New Yorkers suffered 
from PTSD four years after the attack. He worries there will not be a 
plan or enough money this time to treat a similar share of a vastly 
greater population.</p>
<p>Dr. Yuval Neria: There is kind of almost like a honeymoon phase right
 now. There is consensus, high adrenaline, adrenaline, and let’s do it 
together. I think once this is ended, and we face the reality of the 
aftermath, coupled with financial difficulties and shortage of services–
 all of those things can rapidly elevate the risk for a second pandemic,
 which will be a mental health pandemic.</p>
<p>The cascading challenges were already falling on Francesca 
Santacroce, who was managing them through therapy. But the day after we 
first talked to her, the hospital called. Her father Joseph Santacroce 
passed away. He was 50 years old. </p>
<p>John Dickerson: Francesca, I’m very, very sorry about your father. </p>
<p>Francesa told us she had been unable to see or speak to her father in
 the hospital, but after he died, she was given permission to enter the 
intensive care unit. </p>
<p>Francesca Santacroce: And they walked me through the ICU to see him. 
And just to see all those people on ventilators, it was really sad. As I
 walked in, the nursing staff, all the physicians, everyone who was on 
his case, they were– they were crying too. They were so upset and he 
looked like he was sleeping honestly. And I said to him, “I’m here. I’m 
going to take care of everyone. You know, and everyone’s in good hands. 
You know, I got this.” And I told him I loved him. And that he can, you 
know, that he can go to heaven and I’ll take care of everyone down here.</p>
<p>Francesca’s first task was taking care of her father’s belongings and his car which he had driven to the hospital. </p>
<p>John Dickerson: And what was going through your head, Francesca, as you were driving home?</p>
<p>Francesca Santacroce: I apologized to him.</p>
<p>John Dickerson: Apologized why?</p>
<p>Francesca Santacroce: I was so sad that he had to, you know, go 
through that alone. He had to spend his last– last week in quarantine, 
you know. He didn’t get to talk to us or see us. I wish that I was able 
to hug him one last time and tell him I loved him one last time and, you
 know, have him play a joke on me one last time. If I would’ve known 
that this was coming, I would’ve used that time more wisely. </p>
<p>Daniel Kaplin: One of the areas of guilt and regret is not being able to say good-bye. </p>
<p>John Dickerson: What do you think are the challenges that Francesca now faces?</p>
<p>Daniel Kaplin: She’s in her early 20s. She is not financially secure.
 Mom is medically fragile. Just the anxiety around, “How do you float 
the household,” and then long term– how does she take care of the family
 while truly pursuing her dreams?</p>
<figcaption><span>Wynton Marsalis honors father on 60 Minutes</span></figcaption><p>The day Francesca learned of her father’s death, jazz great Wynton Marsalis’ father checked into a hospital. </p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: He was in New Orleans.</p>
<p>John Dickerson: And you were in New York?</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: I was in New York. I was kind of torn between, if I 
go down there, he doesn’t have it, and I bring it to him, it’s going to 
be worse. </p>
<p>Four days later, Ellis Marsalis, a respected jazz musician and 
teacher, passed away from complications of COVID-19. He was 85 years 
old.</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: He just didn’t complain. He had a world view. He 
said, “Man, I don’t determine my time.” He said, “The fact that you lose
 a loved one is no more significant than all the other people who are 
losing loved ones.” And that was always his philosophy. </p>
<p>John Dickerson: We’re all part of the same human family.</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: He felt that. He believed it. He played it. He 
taught it. And– you know, and he accepted death in that way, also.</p>
<p>While Marsalis grieves, he is also responsible for Jazz at Lincoln 
Center, where he is managing and artistic director. The nonprofit has 
had to close its performance space and has lost millions of dollars. And
 Marsalis says things are even harder for freelance musicians.</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: My father was a freelance musician. If this had 
happened when we were growing up, we would literally just have to go 
from house to house on our street and– just to eat. This is a very 
serious time– for the survival of a lot of our musicians. </p>
<p>A man used to juggling projects, he once contributed to this 
broadcast, Marsalis has been touching base with musicians around the 
world and trying to raise money for Jazz at Lincoln Center and also for 
struggling artists. All of this returns him to the lessons of his 
father. </p>
<p>John Dickerson: So if he taught you about philosophy as much as about
 music– what would his advice be for this moment we are in, where we’re 
sitting in an empty theater, we don’t know when this is going to end, 
people are suffering.</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: You know, he would say, you know– “Where you at, 
man? What are you gonna do?” He said, “You talkin’ about doin’? You 
doin’? Do sumpin’. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>John Dickerson: So how does that work when you’re talking to all the 
people who are involved at Jazz at Lincoln Center, and you’re–</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: I say almost the same mantra. You know, we– we’re in
 a bad position. And we’re not going to get out of this overnight. But 
everybody is in our position. So let’s embrace this space. Let’s work on
 the trust that we’ve built up all of these years. Let’s go out and make
 stuff happen that we want to see happen, we have to move very fast, but
 we have to be even more process-oriented and more deliberate. And 
that’s how you master a moment of chaos. And that is also the strength 
of jazz. </p>
<p>John Dickerson: I was just going to say, jazz – all of that practice, and then in the moment, you have to be ready–</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: That’s right. You marshal all your forces.</p>
<p>John Dickerson: And be ready to improvise.</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: And be ready to meet the demands of that moment. 
Another thing that we say to each other is, “Let’s see if we are who we 
said we were before we had to deal with this.” When…</p>
<p>John Dickerson: And what does that mean? </p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: When everything is normal, it’s easy for us to be 
full. Full of arrogance and commentary. Now we have to be for real. Our 
morality, our concept, our integrity, All these things are coming to 
bear in this moment. </p>
<p>John Dickerson: Because it’s a test.</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: Yeah, let’s see, man.</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: We have a tendency to hear all the negative. 
Everybody’s dying, this and that, skull and crossbones. There’s also 
this reaffirmation of what makes us great, not just as– people in a 
country, as human beings.</p>
<p>Recognizing the good amidst the sorrow is at the heart of the 
second-line funeral celebrations of Marsalis’ native Louisiana. When his
 mother died three years ago the jazz community took up their 
instruments. For Ellis Marsalis that celebration will be delayed.</p>
<p>John Dickerson: Since we’re here in this beautiful space, would you– like to play anything for your father?</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: Oh yeah, definitely. </p>
<p>John Dickerson: Yeah. </p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis: I’ll play something for him. I wanna– wanna lay down my burden down by the riverside.</p>
