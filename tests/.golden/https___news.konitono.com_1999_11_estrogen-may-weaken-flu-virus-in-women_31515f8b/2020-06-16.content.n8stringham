<p>A new study may explain why flu appears to hit men harder than women.
 Researchers who tested various forms of the female sex hormone estrogen
 – which is also present in men – on nasal cells from men and women, 
found the compounds reduced virus replication in the female but not the 
male cells. The researchers – led by Sabra Klein, an associate professor
 at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, MD – 
report their findings in the American Journal of Physiology – Lung 
Cellular and Molecular Physiology. Viruses make us ill when they invade 
our cells and use their machinery to make copies of themselves. The 
copies spread to other cells, setting up a chain reaction that leads to 
disease and also infection of other people. Generally, the fewer copies 
of itself the virus makes, the less severe the disease and the lower the
 chances of it spreading to new hosts, says Prof. Klein. Together with 
her colleagues, she tested the effect of the female sex hormone estrogen
 on the influenza A virus – one of the types of flu virus that spreads 
in people and causes seasonal flu epidemics. They carried out the tests 
in… <a href="file:///go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzA1MDEyLnBocA==" rel="nofollow">Read full this story</a></p>
