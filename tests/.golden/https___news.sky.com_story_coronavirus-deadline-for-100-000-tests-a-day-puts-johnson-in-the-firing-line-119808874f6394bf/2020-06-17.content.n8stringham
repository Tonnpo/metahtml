<p>Boris Johnson is dramatically returning to the heart of government 
after his Downing Street comeback, hosting his first coronavirus news 
conference since his near-death illness.</p>
<p>As well as facing questions about the government's handling of the 
crisis, it will be his first opportunity to speak publicly about 
becoming a father again, after his fiancee <a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/carrie-symonds-8575">Carrie Symonds</a> gave birth to a son.</p>
<p>His appearance will come after he chairs a Cabinet meeting for the 
first time in five weeks and on the deadline day for Health Secretary 
Matt Hancock's target of 100,000 tests a day.</p>
<p> <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-sharp-rise-in-covid-19-deaths-in-uk-as-care-homes-included-in-total-for-first-time-11980475"> </a></p><p><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-sharp-rise-in-covid-19-deaths-in-uk-as-care-homes-included-in-total-for-first-time-11980475"> </a></p><h3 class="rm-manual"><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-sharp-rise-in-covid-19-deaths-in-uk-as-care-homes-included-in-total-for-first-time-11980475">More than 26,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK</a></h3><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-sharp-rise-in-covid-19-deaths-in-uk-as-care-homes-included-in-total-for-first-time-11980475"> <p></p> </a> <p></p>
<p>But the prime minister is expected to dash hopes of major changes to 
lockdown rules, after shock figures revealed the UK could have one of 
the world's worst <a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/coronavirus-8483">coronavirus</a> death rates.</p>
<p>Any changes are likely to have to wait until the government's 
scientific advisory panel, Sage, presents evidence to ministers next 
week ahead of the next lockdown review on 7 May.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span>Advertisement</span> </p>
<p>Revealing the PM's attendance at the Downing Street news conference, a
 Number 10 insider said: "He will give an update on the country's fight 
against this disease and the steps we are taking to defeat it."</p>
<p>The latest figures for the UK, which now include care homes as well 
as NHS hospitals, show 165,221 cases and 26,097 deaths and reveal that 
on eight days this month more than 1,000 people died from the virus.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/boris-johnson-5853">Mr Johnson</a> returned to work in Downing Street on Monday after a week in hospital which <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-carrie-symonds-thanks-nhs-staff-as-she-joins-boris-johnson-at-chequers-11972503">included three nights in intensive care</a>, followed by a fortnight convalescing at Chequers with the heavily pregnant Ms Symonds.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">At the start of the week, Number 10 said the PM 
would return to a "normal schedule", which would have almost certainly 
have included appearing at Prime Minister's Questions had his fiancee 
not given birth.</p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"> <span>March 3: Johnson 'almost certainly' will take paternity leave</span> </figcaption><p class="rm-manual">But
 apart from being present for the birth of his son at a London hospital,
 the prime minister has spent most of the week in meetings with senior 
ministers, advisers and close aides ahead of the crucial Cabinet 
meeting.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">After the Cabinet meeting, the prime minister will 
be accompanied at his news conference by the government's chief 
scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and Professor Chris Whitty, 
England's chief medical officer.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">It will be Mr Johnson's first appearance at the 
Downing Street coronavirus news conference since 25 March, the day 
before he announced he was suffering from the virus and the day after he
 last chaired a Cabinet meeting.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-lockdowns-unlocked-which-countries-are-easing-restrictions-11974027"> </a></p><p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-lockdowns-unlocked-which-countries-are-easing-restrictions-11974027"> </a></p><h3 class="rm-manual"><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-lockdowns-unlocked-which-countries-are-easing-restrictions-11974027">Which countries are easing lockdowns?</a></h3><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-lockdowns-unlocked-which-countries-are-easing-restrictions-11974027"> <p class="rm-manual"></p> </a> <p class="rm-manual"></p>
<p class="rm-manual">Mr Johnson is expected to spell out why social 
distancing restrictions must remain largely in place for the time being,
 despite growing pressure from Tory MPs and business leaders for a 
relaxation of the rules.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">His tough stance follows the disclosure that only 
the United States, with 60,000 deaths, and Italy, with 28,000, have a 
higher death toll than the UK and only Spain and Belgium have a worse 
per-head death rate in Europe.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">But he is expected to face tough questions not only
 on the lockdown but also on the government's record on personal 
protection equipment for NHS staff and Mr Hancock's pledge of 100,000 
tests a day by 30 April.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Announcing his pledge back on 2 April, Mr Hancock 
said: "I'm now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of 
this month. That is the goal and I'm determined we'll get there."</p>
<p class="rm-manual">But critics, including some inside government, 
claim Mr Hancock is still a long way off his testing target. So far, 
capacity has reached 73,400 tests and only 52,429 of those tests are 
being used.</p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"> <span>Image:</span> <span>The couple had said they were expecting a baby in 'early summer'. Pic:Javier Garcia/BPI/Shutterstock </span> </figcaption><p class="rm-manual">To
 help plug that gap, Mr Hancock has widened eligibility, including 
offering a test for anyone living or working at a care home whether they
 have symptoms or not and all 65-year-olds with symptoms.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">But the ambitious testing target is being attacked 
by NHS and hospital trust bosses, who claim it distracts from 
shortcomings in the government's long-term coronavirus strategy.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">"The recent public focus on whether 100,000 tests 
will be performed on April 30 is a red herring," said NHS Providers, the
 body that represents NHS managers.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The report claims the English health and care 
system "started from a poor position" and struggled to demonstrate a 
"clear, effective and well-communicated strategy", with a lack of 
clarity on who would be tested, when, how, and with what frequency.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The report adds: "A vast amount still remains to be done to reach a testing regime that can be described as fit for purpose."</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Chris Hopson, NHS Providers chief executive, said: 
"Testing is one area where, despite all the work delivered by trusts and
 the NHS, the health and care system as a whole has struggled to develop
 an effective, co-ordinated approach.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">"As we consider the route out of lockdown, what trust leaders need now is clarity on the testing regime from here on.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">"Setting a target for a number of tests for April 
30 may have had a galvanising effect. But what matters most is an 
updated strategy to take us through the exit from lockdown."</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Responding to the report, a Department of Health 
and Social Care spokesman said testing was "absolutely critical" and 
capacity had more than doubled within weeks.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">He added: "Our aim as we tackle this virus is to 
make it easy, fast and simple for any essential worker who needs a test 
to get a test.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">"In addition to setting up a nationwide network of 
drive in testing sites, we have introduced home testing kit delivery, 
deployed mobile testing units operated by the Armed Forces, and built 
three new 'mega labs' to analyse test samples."</p>
