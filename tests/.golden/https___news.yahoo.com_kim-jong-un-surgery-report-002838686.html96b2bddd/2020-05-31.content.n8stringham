<h1 class="rm-manual">Mystery Surrounds Kim Jong Un’s Health After Surgery Reports</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">Jennifer Jacobs and Shinhye Kang</p>

<p class="rm-manual">(Bloomberg) --</p>
<p class="">Mystery surrounded Kim Jong Un’s health after U.S. and South
 Korean officials gave differing accounts of the North Korean leader’s 
condition following his unusual absence from recent holiday 
celebrations.</p>
<p>Kim was in critical condition after undergoing cardiovascular surgery
 last week and the Trump administration wasn’t sure of his current 
health, said U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified. One of the 
officials said the White House was told that Kim took a turn for the 
worse after the procedure, while CNN earlier cited a U.S. official with 
direct knowledge saying the 36-year-old leader may be in “grave danger.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s office said that Kim 
was conducting “normal activities” in a rural part of the country 
assisted by close aides and no special movements were detected. Moon 
spokesman Kang Min-seok said earlier there was nothing to confirm on the
 speculation over Kim’s health.</p>
<p>North Korea’s state-run news broadcast at 6:30 p.m. local time made 
no mention of Kim, and the official Korean Central News Agency didn’t 
provide an update on his condition. Kim Min-ki, head of the intelligence
 committee in South Korea’s parliament, told Yonhap News Agency he 
believes there’s no unusual signs regarding Kim’s health after he was 
briefed by the country’s spy agency.</p>
<p>The news around Kim’s health spurred the benchmark Kospi gauge to 
extend losses to as much as 3% while the won slid as much as 1.7% 
against the dollar. The Kospi closed 1% lower.</p>
<p>The health of Kim, overweight and a heavy smoker, is one of North 
Korea’s most closely guarded secrets, typically only known by a handful 
of people in the inner circle of leadership. While North Korea had 
scaled down major events as it battles the coronavirus pandemic, 
speculation about Kim had been growing since his unprecedented absence 
from April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather and state
 founder Kim Il Sung, one of the biggest days on the country’s calendar.</p>
<p>Even the most well-informed North Korea experts find it hard to tell 
what’s happening in the secretive state. The Daily NK, a Seoul-based 
website that gathers information from informants inside the isolated 
nation, separately reported that Kim underwent a “cardiovascular 
surgical procedure” and was now mostly recovered. Reuters cited an 
official with the Chinese Communist Party’s International Liaison 
Department saying that Kim wasn’t believed to be critically ill.</p>
<p>“I saw some reports, but I don’t know what these sources are,” 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing
 Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>U.S. National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien told reporters on 
Tuesday morning that the Trump administration is “watching the reports 
closely.” “It’s just hard to know, we’re keeping a close eye on it,” he 
said.</p>
<p>Any leadership crisis in North Korea could potentially have serious 
ramifications for regional stability, as well as for talks with the U.S.
 over the country’s nuclear arsenal. Kim, who took power in 2011 
following his father’s 17-year reign, developed the capability to 
deliver a nuclear warhead to any part of the U.S. before engaging in 
direct talks with President Donald Trump over his arsenal and sanctions 
imposed on the state.</p>
<p>“When Kim Jong Un came to power, his path to leadership had been 
carefully cultivated by his father’s guidance and maneuvering,” said 
Mintaro Oba, a former U.S. diplomat who was specialized in Korean 
Peninsula issues. “Now, there is no clear transition plan and no clear 
future leader.”</p>
<p>White Horse</p>
<p>Kim has been shown in state media in recent months appearing at 
military drills and riding a white horse on the country’s revered Mt. 
Paektu, where state propaganda says his grandfather used as a guerrilla 
base to fight Japanese colonial occupiers. North Korea’s state media 
reported on April 11 that Kim attended a Politburo meeting of the ruling
 Workers’ Party. The next day it said he inspected a military unit, but 
didn’t reveal the date of that visit.</p>
<p>The South Korean Unification Ministry said Friday it was 
“inappropriate” to speculate about the reasons for Kim’s absence. Kim 
has made 17 public appearances this year that were mentioned in state 
media -- at a pace of a little more than one a week -- the ministry 
said. That’s slightly down from 84 public appearances last year.</p>
<p>South Korean intelligence said Kim Jong Un married Ri Sol Ju, a 
former singer, in 2009. They are thought to have three children, but 
there is no official mention of their offspring. Dennis Rodman, the 
offbeat basketball great who visited Kim in North Korea, said in 2013 he
 held the leader’s baby girl in his arms, a daughter named Ju Ae.While 
there’s been little time for him to groom a successor, Kim raised the 
status of his younger sister Kim Yo Jong as a key player in the 
secretive state. She was thrust into the global spotlight when she 
served as envoy to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea,
 and became the first member of the immediate ruling family to visit 
Seoul.</p>
