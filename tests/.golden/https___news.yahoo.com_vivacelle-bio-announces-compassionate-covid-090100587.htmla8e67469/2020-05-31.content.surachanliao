<h1 class="rm-manual">Vivacelle Bio Announces Compassionate Use for COVID-19 Patients with Its Sepsis Treatment, VBI-S</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><span><span><a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/yahoo/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">PR Newswire</a></span></span>April 21, 2020</p>
<p>Most COVID patients die of septic shock. In early studies VBI-S 
improved blood pressure and oxygenation of septic shock patients when 
all other measures had failed.</p>
<p><span>CHICAGO</span>, <span>April 21, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ -- 
Vivacelle Bio, Inc., a U.S. biotechnology firm that develops products 
for critically ill patients, will make VBI-S, available for use in 
COVID-19 patients. Seventy percent of deaths of COVID-19 patients are 
due to septic shock. While intravenous infusion of VBI-S has 
demonstrated encouraging preliminary results in a phase IIa clinical 
study, VBI-S remains an experimental drug. See a listing of our VBI-S 
IIa clinical trial at the link: <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2781997-1&amp;h=1963715468&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2Frecord%2FNCT04257136%3Fcond%3Dseptic%2Bshock%26cntry%3DUS%26state%3DUS%253AIN%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2Frecord%2FNCT04257136%3Fcond%3Dseptic%2Bshock%26cntry%3DUS%26state%3DUS%253AIN%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1" rel="nofollow noopener">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04257136?cond=septic+shock&amp;cntry=US&amp;state=US%3AIN&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1</a></p>
<p>VBI-S could rescue lives of COVID patients even when standard 
treatment has failed by shifting the balance of complex nitric oxide 
effects toward survival.</p>
<p>Vivacelle Bio CEO <span>Harven DeShield</span>, JD, PhD, commented, 
"VBI-S holds the promise of being a compelling and novel technology to 
address COVID-19 induced sepsis and septic shock and thus the potential 
to save numerous lives both in the US and globally."</p>
<p>Cuthbert Simpkins MD inventor of VBI-S and Vivacelle Bio Chief 
Innovation Officer commented, "It is fulfilling to serve both as a 
critical care physician providing direct care to COVID patients and as a
 scientist whose invention could rescue people who are dying of this 
disease."</p>
<p><span>Mallory Williams</span> MD, MPH Chief of Trauma and Critical Care and Director of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at <span>Howard University</span>
 Hospital stated, "I am greatly encouraged that Vivacelle Bio through 
its innovative discoveries has proposed therapeutic solutions for the 
most critically ill patients. Severe sepsis claims the lives of over 
250,000 Americans and 10 million globally each year and now there is a 
reason to believe that we are closer to significantly decreasing this 
number."</p>
<p><span>Mukesh Kumar</span>, PhD, Vivacelle's Senior VP of Regulatory 
Affairs stated, "We look to partner with physicians and hospitals to 
make VBI-S rapidly available to treat COVID-19 patients in dire 
life-threatening condition."</p>
<p><span>Jim J. Huang</span>, Ph.D., CEO of Ascendia Pharmaceuticals, a 
specialty CDMO company, engaged in nanoparticle formulation, is pleased 
to support Vivacelle Bio in meeting this international crisis.</p>
