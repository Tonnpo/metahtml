<h1>How to protect yourself from the coronavirus</h1>
<p>The Coronavirus has set its sights on the world. Within a few days, 
the virus has become a rage and broken. According to the president of 
China, the Coronavirus is a “devil”, the devil has to fight the whole 
world. Virus lung disease and its infection can prove fatal.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, the ‘Coronavirus’ has swallowed up 132 people 
in China, while more than 4,500 people are currently infected in China. 
Health alerts have been issued around the world. Chinese travelers 
coming and going are being screened at airports. Several countries have 
canceled flights to and from China.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Must Read: <span><a href="https://newsnblogs.com/coronavirus-has-killed-106-and-infected-4515-people-chinese-health-authorities-say/">Coronavirus has killed 106 and infected 4,515 people, Chinese health authorities say</a></span></p>
<p class="">The World Health Organization has termed the spread of the 
‘Coronavirus’ as a medical emergency and has taken precautionary 
measures to prevent its spread. The world had been plagued with similar 
viruses before, including dengue viruses, wind flu viruses, bird flu, 
and SARS but their devastation was not the same as “Corona” but “Corona 
Virus”. Shook the whole world.</p>
<p class="">Despite such advances and advances in medical science, there
 is no definitive protocol for the treatment of viral infections and no 
specific vaccine is available. As a result, the number of deaths due to 
the virus is high. Countries affiliated with China are also affected by 
the virus.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Must Read: <span><a href="https://newsnblogs.com/first-coronavirus-case-found-in-germany/">First Coronavirus case found in Germany</a></span></p>
<p>In Australia, Taiwan, Nepal, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, but also 
in the US, cases of Coronavirus have been reported. Many Chinese 
engineers and workers are working on various national projects in 
Pakistan, so high alert has also been issued in Pakistan.</p>
<p class="">Following the reports of the ‘Coronavirus’, Chinese 
residents working on the Orange Line train and other projects have been 
barred from work and restricted to their residences until the screening.
 The National Institutes of Health has also issued a health advisory on 
the ‘Coronavirus’. Civil Aviation Authority has set up health counters 
at various airports in this regard.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Must Read: <span><a href="https://newsnblogs.com/first-coronavirus-case-found-in-pakistan/">First Coronavirus case found in Pakistan</a></span></p>
<p class="">Separate isolation wards have been set up in different 
hospitals. The team will arrive in Pakistan today to diagnose the 
‘Coronavirus’ from China for the diagnosis of the disease.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span><a href="https://newsnblogs.com/what-is-coronavirus/">What is the Corona Virus?</a></span></p>
<p>When did the disease begin?</p>
<p>How does Coronavirus infection spread?</p>
<p>What steps are needed to prevent it?</p>
<p>How to protect yourself from coronavirus?</p>
<ol> <li>Wash your hands with soap or use a hand sanitizer that contains alcohol.</li> <li>Sneeze and cough into tissues or the crook of your elbow. …</li> <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick, especially people exhibiting respiratory symptoms and fever.</li> <li>Stay home when you’re sick.</li> </ol>
<p>All these questions are being answered in this article to guide the 
public. Coronavirus sufferers have symptoms of colds, sore throats, 
headaches and fever; the body feels tired, the nose is constantly 
flowing. Lungs are affected if an infection is high. The most dangerous 
is the moment when the infection is caused by pneumonia. It causes 
severe infections in the lungs, difficulty in breathing, high fever, 
such as needing immediate hospital treatment. When the infection is 
high, the breath is stopped and artificial respiration is required. 
Obviously, in this case, it becomes a medical emergency. If the 
infection spreads, the breath stops and death can occur within a few 
hours.</p>
<p class="">All symptoms of coronavirus disease are similar to 
pneumonia. The outbreak of the disease began in December 2019 in the 
cities of Hubei Province, China, where 132 people have lost their lives 
so far. One person was also reported dead in Beijing. There has also 
been a death in India. Thousands of people have been affected by this. 
Over 9,000 suspected cases are being reviewed. More than 500 Pakistani 
students are studying in different universities in Hubei and Wuhan in 
China, they have appealed to the Arbuckle authorities to expel them 
immediately so that they can be killed by the deadly virus.</p>

<p>The Coronavirus easily transmits from an infected person to a healthy
 person. The affected person can spread the disease for two to five days
 to others. For this reason, if someone has been diagnosed with the 
disease, it is kept in isolation for at least a week so that healthy 
individuals are protected from the virus. Symptoms at the onset of the 
disease are similar to colds and upper respiratory infections. 
Therefore, treatment is beneficial in the meantime, but the most 
important is to keep the patient in isolation during this time so that 
other healthy individuals are protected from the devastation of the 
disease. Blood tests are done to detect the presence.</p>
<p>In China, the coronavirus first transmitted to humans through snakes.
 Pets and dogs are also infected with the virus and transmit the virus 
to humans. Symptoms of the Crohn’s virus, like colds, usually last from 7
 days to 10 days. If during this time, complete relaxation and taking 
medication with the doctor’s advice, the disease will spread and the man
 will recover. Is. So there is no need to worry more about the 
Coronavirus and not worry. Most victims are automatically healed for ten
 days a week.</p>
<p>China has locked down its provinces to control the outbreak of the 
coronavirus. More than 60 million Chinese people have been confined to 
their cities. New Year’s holidays in Shanghai City have been extended 
until February 9. So far, the number of affected people has reached 5974
 in China, of which 976 people are suffering from pneumonia. Admission 
tests at Chinese universities have been canceled. That is, the great 
medical emer sex was implicated. According to the Foreign Ministry 
announcement, 515 Pakistani students are studying in Wuhan, China, and 
they are healthy. There are no signs of the virus being detected in any 
of the students, but all children are upset and wish to emigrate. May 
Allah protect these students.</p>
<p>Chinese citizens are determined to fight the Coronavirus. There are 
banners everywhere in the city: “We will not defeat the Coronavirus, we 
will kill the devil virus.” Lockdown in Wuhan has led to a shortage of 
vegetable products and medicines. From other cities in China, the brave 
Chinese people have transported hundreds of containers of vegetables, 
foods, and medicines to Wuhan for one-dimensional expression from 
Wuhan’s homeland. Although the Coronavirus has raged with China around 
the world, it is increasing the number of casualties and victims, but 
its treatment is not so difficult.</p>
<p class="">The first thing to do is not get the initial infection 
caused by Coronavirus or the respiratory obstruction caused by it. 
Relaxing, fever and coughing and taking infection medications are a 
symptom of the disease. Most importantly, if a person is diagnosed with 
Coronavirus or begins to show similar symptoms, this patient should be 
kept in isolation for at least seven days. If the test comes positive 
for the virus, the patient should be kept in complete isolation for at 
least one week after the test. It is important to use precautions, 
masks, and gloves for the patient and all the persons with whom he or 
she is in contact. Spray into the patient’s room and dispose of the 
tissue paper in use. The Coronavirus is a heat-sensitive virus, like the
 cold. Therefore, it is important that the patient is given steam and 
given coffee, vegetable soup to drink so that the symptoms of the 
disease are minimal.</p>

<p>In the event of a fever, give febrile medicine. In case of cough, put
 two tablespoons honey and a little black pepper in a cup of warm water.
 When the disease is diagnosed, in the morning, put one tablespoon of 
olive oil and one teaspoon of honey in a cup of warm milk. Almighty has 
made many changes in turmeric and olive oil.</p>
<p class="">They both have the ability to control infections and have 
antiviral properties. Honey is a cure for every disease. Mint, fennel, 
cinnamon, and ginger are also useful for colds and throat infections. 
Giving warm things to a patient is a good cause for the disease. Be 
happy with the patient because the patient can be contacted despite 
being separated. China’s instructions to restrict its citizens miss the 
instructions given by the Prophet Muhammad (SAWW) 1440 years ago.</p>
