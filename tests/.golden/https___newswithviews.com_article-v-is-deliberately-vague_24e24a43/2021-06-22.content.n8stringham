<p class="rm-manual">By <span><span><a href="https://newswithviews.com/author/guest/" rel="author">Guest Writer</a></span></span><span>|</span><span>2016-11-23T13:05:00-05:00</span><span>November 23rd, 2016</span><span>|</span></p>
<p>There seems to be needless concern over Article V, the amending 
clause of the U.S. Constitution. Both friend and foe of the Constitution
 complain that, while the Founding Fathers gave the people a way to 
initiate the convention process, they dropped the ball by failing to 
establish procedures and regulations for the convention itself.</p>
<p>Was the omission of regulations a mistake? No. Article V is wisely, 
purposely, and deliberately vague. Those who complain that our founders 
left Article V strangely incomplete, fail to understand the most 
fundamental principle of a free and sovereign people.</p>
<p>Constitutional conventions are the government-making systems of free 
citizens. Conventions are sovereign assemblies. They comprise all power,
 including the power to establish the agenda, the rules, the 
regulations, the ratifying method, and all procedures by which the 
people might create, modify, or abolish their government. The convention
 system is the concentration of sovereign power by which “WE THE 
PEOPLE….[did] ordain and establish this Constitution for the United 
States of America.”</p>
<p>Why does Article V lack instructions for future conventions? — 
because no sitting convention can dictate to the next convention. The 
1787 Convention could not make regulations for the next convention 
because the next convention would be just a sovereign as the first 
Convention — just as free to make its own rules as was the Convention at
 Philadelphia in 1787. For that reason Article V is purposely, 
deliberately, and brilliantly vague.</p>
<p>The following is found in the Records of the Federal Convention of 1787:</p>
<p>Mr. Madison did not see why Congress would not be as much bound to 
propose amendments applied for by two-thirds of the States as to call a 
Convention on the like application. He saw no objection however against 
providing a Convention for the purpose of amendments, except only that 
difficulties might arise as to the form, the quorum, and etc. which in 
Constitutional regulations ought to be as much as possible avoided. 
(author’s emphasis)</p>
<p>Why, despite foreseeable difficulties, should constitutional 
regulations be avoided? — because, as we have already noted, today’s 
convention cannot establish procedures for tomorrow’s convention. For 
that reason Article V requires the state legislatures only to apply, 
only to initiate the convention process. Article V provides no 
instructions regarding the form, the quorum, or regulations regarding 
the control of the convention which the state is simply asking Congress 
to call. The reason for this is simple: State legislatures have only the
 statutory power granted by their state constitutions; they have no 
structural authority, no government-making power.</p>
<p>As a general rule, when one principle is understood, it casts a 
little light on related principles. For example: State legislatures are 
not greater than their creators. This principle was affirmed during the 
1787 Convention while the deputies were considering resolutions on who 
should ratify the new plan.</p>
<p>The record states:</p>
<p>Col. Mason considered a reference of the plan to the authority of the
 people as one of the most important and essential of the Resolutions. 
The Legislatures have no power to ratify it. They are the mere creatures
 of the State Constitutions, and cannot be greater than their creators….
 Whither then must we resort? To the people with whom all power remains 
that has not been given up in the Constitutions derived from them. It 
was of great moment he observed that this doctrine should be cherished 
as the basis of free Government.</p>
<p>During that same discussion (July 23) James Madison made a similar observation:</p>
<p>Mr. Madison thought it clear that the Legislatures were incompetent 
to the proposed changes. These changes would make essential inroads on 
the State constitutions, and it would be a novel and dangerous doctrine 
that a Legislature could change the constitution under which it held its
 existence.</p>
<p>The basis of free government is that neither the legislature nor the 
Congress can determine the power and scope of the Constitution to which 
they owe their existence. A system under which lawmakers determine the 
limits of their power is the definition of a dictatorship. The doctrine 
that legislatures were not qualified to legislate changes in the 
constitutions under which they serve, was well-established at the 
founding of our country.</p>
<p>Today’s state legislators who seek to bring about a “limited” 
convention ignore the fact that during the first 100 years of American 
history all state applications for a convention were brilliantly vague —
 purposely absent even the subject for which the convention had been 
called.</p>
<p>A constitutional convention is not “simply an extension of the state 
legislature.” This widely asserted idea is a corruption of the authority
 of a free and sovereign people. Only the people have government-making 
and government-modifying authority. A state legislator has only the 
powers delegated to him by his state constitution, which most assuredly 
excludes the power to regulate a constitutional convention, or make 
rules for a “convention of states,” or to run an “Article V convention,”
 or to exercise structural authority in any form or under any pretext.</p>
<p>A state’s application for a convention that does anything more than 
initiate the convention process, as required by Article V, amounts to a 
usurpation of the authority of the people who alone have power to set 
the terms and determine the scope of their convention. Government is 
nothing more than the creature and cannot be greater than its creator.</p>
<p>Most current applications for a convention contain rules, 
regulations, and limitations on the purpose and scope of the requested 
convention. The “limitation language” in these bills is calculated to 
allay the very real concerns of state legislators who have been 
reluctant to support the uncharted road to a modern convention.</p>
<p>In addition to illegal (completely unenforceable) limitations 
contained in the state resolutions, the convention lobby is pushing 
“delegate responsibility” bills that impose severe penalties on 
convention delegates who might stray into constitutional changes not 
specifically authorized by the state’s resolution. It would be hard to 
find a more serious violation of the doctrine of civilian sovereignty 
than is found in such bills. Convention limitation bills, in any form, 
constitute the “novel and dangerous doctrine” of which James Madison has
 spoken.</p>
<p>It is a curious thing that after 227 years the convention lobby has 
“just discovered” that state legislatures have an amazing array of 
powers unknown to America’s Founding Fathers. And it is equally curious 
that the convention lobby ignores the authority of a sovereign people 
which in 1787 was “cherished as the basis of free government.”</p>
