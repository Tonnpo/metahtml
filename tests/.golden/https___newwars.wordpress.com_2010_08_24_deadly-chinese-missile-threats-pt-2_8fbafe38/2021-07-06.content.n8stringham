<h1 class="rm-manual">Deadly Chinese Missile Threats Pt 2</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">August 24, 2010</p>
<p class="rm-manual">tags: <a href="https://newwars.wordpress.com/tag/ballistic-missile/" rel="tag">Ballistic missile</a>, <a href="https://newwars.wordpress.com/tag/china/" rel="tag">China</a>, <a href="https://newwars.wordpress.com/tag/cruise-missile/" rel="tag">cruise missile</a></p>
<p>Pershing II missile</p>
<p>The principle argument rising of late is the questioning whether 
China has the capability to build a missile with the accuracy to strike a
 large warship maneuvering on the high seas. The idea is that since 
there is no clear evidence of China even deploying such a missile as the
 ASBM, the need for concern is evidentially remote. Read the following 
critique from <a href="http://formerspook.blogspot.com/2010/08/carrier-killer.html">In from the Cold</a>:</p>
<p>First…there is the nagging issue of demonstrated accuracy. The DF-21D
 is still in testing, and so far, it has not proved its ability to 
strike a carrier-sized target over the horizon. True, the problem could 
be solved by placing a nuclear warhead on the missile, but that 
“solution” would invite a massive U.S. response, one reason that China 
emphasizes the conventional capabilities of the DF-21D.</p>
<p>It’s also worth remembering the first rule of precision strike: 
devastatingly accurate weapons require intelligence of comparable 
precision. Beijing is working hard to improve its intel, surveillance 
and reconnaissance capabilities, but (once again) there is inconclusive 
evidence regarding the PRC’s ability to develop–and deliver–such 
information for a time-sensitive target like an aircraft carrier at sea.</p>
<p>Yet the question should not be does China possess this technology but
 is there a possibility the technology could work. In fact there is 
clear proof in the viability of the ASBM. The following conclusion comes
 to us from Geoff at <a href="http://forden.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/2819/df-21-delta-some-early-thoughts">Arms Control Wonk</a>:</p>
<p>(My) rather simple calculations have shown that both types of 
guidance and control for an anti-ship ballistic missile are possible. 
But both would be pushing China’s technology considerably.</p>
<p>But what if China didn’t rely on its own technology, and the perhaps 
decades of testing required to deploy such a system. Recall that the US 
has advanced guidance systems of missiles and bombs for decades, and 
they have been proved dramatically workable in combat. Here is Defense 
Secretary Robert Gates in a very famous recent speech at the <a href="https://newwars.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/breakinggates-stuns-navy-league-with-fleet-proposals/">US Navy League</a>:</p>
<p>At the higher end of the access-denial spectrum, the virtual monopoly the U.S. has enjoyed with <a rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision-guided_munition">precision guided</a>
 weapons is eroding – especially with long-range, accurate anti-ship 
cruise and ballistic missiles that can potentially strike from over the 
horizon. This is a particular concern with aircraft carriers and other 
large, multi-billion-dollar blue-water surface combatants, where, for 
example, a Ford-class carrier plus its full complement of the latest 
aircraft would represent potentially a $15 to $20 billion set of 
hardware at risk.</p>
<p>Then there is the fear that some of our technology is already deployed on the <a rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DF-21">DF-21</a> series of missiles, with stolen <a rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM-31_Pershing">Pershing II</a> Missile guidance. <a href="http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/hticbm/20100113.aspx">Strategypage </a>has more:</p>
<p>As the story goes, the Chinese have reverse engineered, reinvented or
 stolen the 1970s technology that went into the U.S. Pershing ballistic 
missile. This 7.5 ton U.S. Army missile also had an 1,800 kilometers 
range, and could put its nuclear warhead within 30 meters of its aim 
point. This was possible because the guidance system had its own 
radar…This kind of accuracy made the Russians very uncomfortable, as it 
made their command bunkers vulnerable. The Russians eventually agreed to
 a lot of nuclear and missile disarmament deals in order to get the 
Pershings decommissioned in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that <a rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGM-109_Tomahawk">Tomahawk cruise missiles</a>, some of our most accurate and again well-proven weapons have fallen into Chinese hands:</p>
<p>China also continues developing long range cruise missiles, and 
adapting them to operate from aircraft. The latest missile to get this 
treatment is the DH-10. This weapon is similar to early U.S. cruise 
missiles, and has a range of 1,500-3,000 kilometers and uses GPS, along 
with terrain mapping. The DH-10 was first shown publicly in the recent 
60th anniversary of the communists taking control of China, on October 
1st.) The aircraft carried version is called the CJ-10. This is believed
 to be based on some American <a rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile">cruise missile</a> technology.</p>
<p>So the precision technology which has dominated American warmaking 
since the 1990s is now out of the box. Soon this proliferation of 
advanced targeting will be joined to the widespread ballistic missile 
stocks, if the history of warfare is any guide. The following info is 
via the DoD and <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=60475">American Forces Press Service</a>:</p>
<p>(The director of the Missile Defense Agency) pointed out a 
proliferation of Scud missiles that originate from the old Soviet Union.
 According to intelligence, he said, more than 6,000 missiles are in 
countries other than NATO, the United States, China and Russia, as well 
as more than 1,000 launchers.</p>
<p> The United States has witnessed many failures in the development and
 testing of these systems. However, O’Reilly cautioned against 
complacency in the face of other countries’ efforts. The United States 
experienced failures as well in the 1960s and in missile defense in the 
1990s, he noted.</p>
<p> “History shows that if they are persistent, they will be 
successful,” he said. “But history also shows that it is extremely 
challenging to be precise on when they will be successful.”</p>
<p>From yesterdays and today’s post, you can gather at least two conclusions concerning the Chinese missile threats:</p>
<ul> <li>Their launch systems would be extremely difficult to find and target.</li> <li>Their
 own targeting and guidance systems, plus numbers might be a 
game-changer blunting our traditional tactic of power projection from 
the sea.</li> </ul>
<p>So what can be done to defeat the upcoming missile threats from China
 and her like-armed clients? I am a firm believer in fighting fire with 
fire. In other words, instead of seeking technological breakthroughs to 
maintain enormously expensive last century naval airpower viable, to use
 missiles to combat the enemy missiles. For instance, in the recent <a href="https://newwars.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/airsea-battle-observations/">AirSea Battle </a>by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments came the following idea:</p>
<p>The Navy should consider investing in conventionally-armed, 
relatively short-range sea-based IRBMs to further complicate PLA 
planning. Depending on missile technical characteristics, both 
submarines and surface ships (not necessarily combatants) could serve as
 potential firing platforms. Ballistic missile striking power should be 
distributed across a large number of platforms similar to the way 
Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles distributed Navy strike power that 
had previously been concentrated in a small number of aircraft carriers.
 An ASBM variant should also be considered.</p>
<p>The Navy then should proceed post-haste to strengthen its guided 
missile fleet, with more subs, including SSGNs and perhaps many surface 
arsenal ships. Another equalizer could come from land-based airpower 
such as USAF bombers and the new <a href="http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/mma/">P-8 Poseidon </a>patrol
 aircraft, arming the latter with stand-off cruise missiles. 
Long-endurance UAVs such as the J-UCAS would also be necessary, which 
can loiter for extended periods and watch for missile launches. This to 
me sees the best way to counter mobile missile launchers, other than a 
land-based invasion which may be extremely difficult and could lead to 
escalation.</p>

 Americans welcome the emergence of China as long as they respect 
international law and act responsibly. We don’t like to see people 
living in poverty. Most Americans are benefiting from consumer goods 
produced there. Trade is good for everyone. The US has always had 
something of a fascination with China from Clipper ships to Pearl Buck. 
We have had pro-China advocates and missionaries (Of course we have had 
demagogues who frightened people with the “yellow peril.”) It was US 
insistence that gave China a seat as a permanent member of the UN 
Security Council. Where I live we have a large number of Chinese 
Americans and in general they do very well, with a strong work ethic and
 appreciation for education. </p> <p class="rm-manual">What we are

 be unduly worried because the Chinese is a very reasonable people. 
Short of threatening Chinese sovereignty, China is NOT going to use the 
ASBM against the American carriers just as USSR is/has not been using 
her SS 18 against the USA. Conversely, America has not used her Trident,
 Minuteman etc missiles against China or USSR.</p><p class="rm-manual"> 
However do not underestimate the Chinese capabilities in science. If 
China can shot a satellite in space and has a mature anti-missile 
system, what makes you think China has not the capability to slam her

 oppose to a moving satellite in space.</p><p class="rm-manual"> At the

 – I made comment on this elsewhere, but can you honestly say that if 
push came to shove in a East-West war (yes, I’m pushing a big ethnic 
button here, but I have a point to it) -that all the hackers in the US 
(forget any other region) would drop whatever their self-interest was 
and assist the US government? Yeah, that’s what I thought. Any hackers 
that exist behind the Chinese CyberWall know that their very existence 
is simply at the State’s behest. If they do anything other than what the
 State tells them to do when the balloon goes up, skrrict (finger across
 the throat). So there you go. Instead auxiliary to your cyberwar arm. 
Who says Totalitarianism doesn’t has it’s advantages?</p> <p class="rm-manual">@Chuck Hill</p> <p class="rm-manual">Good
 questions re:ASBM, but this weapon, even if it isn’t in IOC, has 
already thrown FUD into the capabilities and force structure model of 
the West, particularly the US Navy. By all accounts, it’s very 
successful in that regard, judging by the 30-second sound bytes by 
senior leadership and the whitepapers flying about. It would be very 
ironic if it turned out to be not so “10-feet Tall,” so to speak, much 
like the Mig-25 Foxbat after Belenko’s defection. But in the meantime, 
do we build against it? Smart money says yes. The Chinese believe in the
 long, long term plan and you can bet dollars to doughnuts that if it’s 
not capable now, it will be soon. We’re seeing the Chinese maritime 
ascendance. I have a feeling that Great Britain felt the same way when 
the infant US Navy started kicking their heels with a frigate fleet 
following the Revolutionary War. We’re emoting a mixture of 
condescendence, disbelief, envy and a small fear of what’s to come.</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> x <span><a href="https://newwars.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/deadly-chinese-missile-threats-pt-2/#comment-21554">permalink</a></span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> August 25, 2010 2:52 pm </p> <p class="rm-manual">It has got to be some system to remotely guide something going hypersonic……..</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> x <span><a href="https://newwars.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/deadly-chinese-missile-threats-pt-2/#comment-21553">permalink</a></span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> August 25, 2010 2:48 pm </p> <p class="rm-manual">This is of interest,</p> <p class="rm-manual"><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5621642/americas-most-dangerous-computer-security-breach-was-caused-by-a-flash-drive" rel="nofollow ugc">http://gizmodo.com/5621642/americas-most-dangerous-computer-security-breach-was-caused-by-a-flash-drive</a></p> <p class="rm-manual">But I urge you not to panic. :)</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> Chuck Hill <span><a href="https://newwars.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/deadly-chinese-missile-threats-pt-2/#comment-21552">permalink</a></span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> August 25, 2010 1:11 pm </p> <p class="rm-manual">There are a number of questions about the ASBM and how it works. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Are multiple warheads deployed to cover uncertainty about the position of the target?</p><p class="rm-manual"> Are multiple missiles fired to blanket the area of uncertainty?</p><p class="rm-manual"> Does it get mid-course corrections or updates?</p><p class="rm-manual"> What are the primary cuing sensors? radar or elint satellites? over the horizon radars?</p><p class="rm-manual"> HFDF?

 that’s it exactly. If you disconnect your PC from your router (both

 is the “quality” of all these Chinese IT bods. Yes Chinese graduates

the standard of the degrees? Evidence would suggest that a good

not more vulnerable (Yes they have an infrastructure to protect there

 one that required physical interaction. We (collectively) have no idea

 No. 7 WTC burned and collapsed to the ground, hours after the attack, 
it took Lower Manhattan phone service with it. Along with many others, 
my office building was closed, in large part because of the loss of 
phone service.</p> <p class="rm-manual">When my office re-opened two 
weeks later, we had one working phone for the entire office. It took a 
month to restore full service. Apparently, Verizon was rationing phone 
service in the area. Verizon placed free portable phones on the 
sidewalk. These were pay phones on wheeled carts rigged to not need 
coins. The news services, National Guard and other organizations mostly 
communicated via satellite dish; they were all over the place.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 NYPD had set up checkpoints on the street and asked for your photo ID. 
Funny, how people close the barn door after the horse is out. One of the
 safety measures put in place after the 1993 truck bomb attack, was the 
installation of turnstiles and security guards in the twin towers before
 you could take the elevator. Funny, how that didn’t help much on the 
day of the 2001 air plane attack.</p> <p class="rm-manual">My subway 
line was closed, forcing me to get off a train several blocks away. 
Coming from Brooklyn, the first thing I noticed in the Manhattan air was
 the terrible odor, the sickly sweet stench of burning flesh. Those 
fires burned 100 days. Office buildings draped enormous American flags 
over the side. I don’t know where they got those flags. They weren’t 
something you could pick up in a store downtown. Like others things that
 happened in those days, they just appeared, out of generosity or human 
need.</p> <p class="rm-manual">That was the result of one kinetic attack on the telephone system.</p> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> Joe <span><a href="https://newwars.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/deadly-chinese-missile-threats-pt-2/#comment-21530">permalink</a></span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> August 24, 2010 10:45 pm </p> <p class="rm-manual">Mike

 the USAF bomber-as-missile-ferry role you bring up, I’d suggest 
considering the “something old, something new” B-747 concept moreso than

 any six-shooters or Roman candles go off, Sino and American hackers 
will be hard at work in their cyber dungeons, spinning both powers, 
particularly super-high tech U.S., into dysfunction, possibly sparing us
 the folly of shooting down satellites, and thereby getting our own 
shiny orbs shot down, blinding us for months, if not years, from 
effective worldwide military action.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Cyberwarfare
 will not only target homeland infrastructure, but anything controlled 
by computer. Since the DoD has already been hacked by someone, I am 
surmising that military ships and planes can be hacked too, creating 
terrifying scenarios where both sides would shoot themselves in the 
foot, in a manner of speaking. </p> <p class="rm-manual">I watched a 
demonstration on tv of an older generator which nonetheless had a chip 
in it, a sinkex hull if you like, hacked to run in overdrive until it 
shook, rattled and rolled itself to death. From what I’ve heard, China 
and the U.S. are pretty evenly matched in cyperwarfare capabilities.</p> <p class="rm-manual">So
 we would need to be darn sure what are doing before we attack China, or
 even a small entity that has brilliant hackers working for it. The hard
 truth is, the future has already arrived in ways we may not fully 
appreciate or like. We might invite hackers from both sides to sit down 
and parly together over a soda and pizza before allowing the bigwigs and

 the fact that domain of remote sensing and surveillance is no longer a 
Western high ground. The Chinese can (if they have not already) easily 
build a space-based sensing infrastructure that can facilitate F2T2 
against maritime targets.</p> <p class="rm-manual">With that in mind, 
the only obvious counters are to build out BMD – get a move on proving

 I might have mentioned in a previous post, as the story goes, the

Chinese, like the Soviets before them, are good spies. Plus they have 
the advantage of having many hi-tech scientists working in the U.S. in 
defense industries. In MHO, the Chinese will learn how to make just 
about anything. They have long deployed nuclear weapons, put satellites 
in space, and now demonstrated the ability to shoot them down.</p> <p class="rm-manual">At
 the moment, I don’t see the wisdom of trying to match Chinese anti-ship
 ballistic missiles with counter IRBMs launched at sea, guided by UAVs, 
to hit the Chinese launch sites. Sounds iffy and very expensive to me. 
No question we need ABMs. We will soon have shoot-down lasers at sea.
