<h1 class="rm-manual">US charges dozens of North Koreans in $2.5B sanctions-busting scheme</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span><a href="https://newzandar.com/2020/05/">May 29, 2020</a></span> <span><a href="https://newzandar.com/author/admin/">Newzandar Editor</a></span> <span><a href="https://newzandar.com/category/news/" rel="category tag">News</a></span> <span><a href="https://newzandar.com/us-charges-dozens-of-north-koreans-in-2-5b-sanctions-busting-scheme/#mh-comments">0</a></span> </p>
<p>The Justice Department has accused a network of North Korean and 
Chinese citizens of secretly advancing North Korea’s nuclear weapons 
program by channeling at least $2.5 billion in illicit payments through 
hundreds of front companies.</p>
<p>The indictment, unsealed Thursday in Washington’s federal court, is 
believed to be the largest criminal enforcement action ever brought 
against North Korea.</p>
<p>The 33 defendants include executives of North Korea’s state-owned 
Foreign Trade Bank, which in 2013 was added to a Treasury Department 
list of sanctioned institutions for transactions that facilitated the 
nuclear proliferation network, and cut off from the U.S. financial 
system.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, the bank officials — one of whom had 
served in North Korea’s primary intelligence bureau — set up branches in
 countries around the world, including Thailand, Russia and Kuwait, and 
used more than 250 front companies to process U.S. dollar payments to 
further the country’s nuclear proliferation program.</p>
<p>The defendants used a variety of tactics to cover their tracks, 
including coded conversations; listing false destinations and customers 
on contracts and invoices; and creating new front companies after the 
banks caught onto the association with North Korea, the indictment says.
 Banks were routinely tricked into processing transactions they wouldn’t
 have ordinarily done, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Five of the defendants are Chinese citizens who operated covert 
branches in either China or Libya. Others who were charged include 
individuals who served at times as the bank’s president or vice 
president.</p>
<p>“Through this indictment, the United States has signified its 
commitment to hampering North Korea’s ability to illegally access the 
U.S. financial system and (to limiting) its ability to use proceeds from
 illicit actions to enhance its illegal WMD and ballistic missile 
programs,” acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin for the District of 
Columbia said in a statement.</p>
<p>The U.S. has frozen and seized about $63 million from the scheme since 2015, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>The case was filed at a time of delicate relations between the U.S. 
and North Korea. The rapprochement that President Donald Trump has tried
 to engineer over the past two years has stalled badly, with the last 
face-to-face meeting between senior officials from the two countries 
taking place in October in Stockholm.</p>
<p>Apart from recent speculation over North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s 
health, which prompted public expressions of concern from Trump, the 
administration has been almost completely silent on North Korea. U.S. 
officials say they remain eager to restart negotiations but have gotten 
no indication from the North that any resumption is imminent.</p>
<p>The indictment also reflects ongoing concerns about sanctions 
violations related to North Korea. Last month, for instance, United 
Nations experts recommended blacklisting 14 vessels for violating 
sanctions against North Korea, accusing the country in a report of 
increasing illegal coal exports and imports of petroleum products and 
continuing with cyber attacks on financial institutions and 
cryptocurrency exchanges to gain illicit revenue.</p>
