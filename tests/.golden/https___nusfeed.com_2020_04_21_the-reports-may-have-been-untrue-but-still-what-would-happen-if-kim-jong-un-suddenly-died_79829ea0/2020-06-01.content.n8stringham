<p class="rm-manual">Time to Read:<span>-</span> words</p>
<p>CNN reported Monday that North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un was “in grave danger” following a cardiovascular surgery.</p>
<p>Both South Korean and Chinese officials have since <a href="https://apnews.com/f477033c5883c24d3583ad1fe8824e52" rel="noopener noreferrer">refuted</a> the claims that Kim is in ill health, and the South Korean sources <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2020/04/20/cnn-report-kim-jong-un-in-grave-danger-after-surgery/" rel="noopener noreferrer">have reported</a>
 that there has been no suspicious activity from North Korea that might 
indicate any health concerns regarding the supreme leader.</p>
<p>However, the apparent health scare raises the important question — who succeeds Kim as supreme leader if he dies young?</p>
<p>There are numerous contenders — from distant family members to party 
loyalists to one of Kim’s young children — for the position of supreme 
leader if Kim’s health continues to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Multiple reports have come out on Kim’s poor health and lifestyle. 
Kim is reportedly a heavy smoker and drinker like his predecessor and 
father, Kim Jong Il. Anna Fifield, Beijing bureau chief for the 
Washington Post and author of a book on Kim’s life, <a href="https://twitter.com/annafifield/status/1252414533391405056?s=21">described</a> the dictator as “a heart attack waiting to happen.” <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2020/04/21/national-security-advisor-robert-obrien-kim-jong-un-health-surgery-successor-north-korea-dictator/" rel="noopener noreferrer">(RELATED:

 Jong Un’s Health — Says Successor Will Likely Be In The ‘Family’)</a></p>
<p>The Kim family holds an almost divine status within North Korea. Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, <a href="https://time.com/2964757/north-korea-kim-il-sung-20-years-anniversary/">founded</a>
 the country in 1945 after a long guerilla campaign against the Japanese
 during World War II. Both the site of his birth, a small village 
outside the capital Pyongyang, and the mountain where he staged his 
guerilla actions against the Japanese, have become sites of pilgrimage 
for North Koreans. All members of the Kim family have been incorporated 
into the pervasive <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16336991">cult of personality</a>
 that dominates North Korean propaganda and culture, with statues and 
public holidays commemorating each major event in both Kim Il Sung and 
Kim Jong Il’s life.</p>

<p>Given the Kim family’s status within the North Korean state, the most
 likely successor to Kim would be another member of the family. The Ten 
Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System, the
 <a href="http://www2.law.columbia.edu/course_00S_L9436_001/North%20Korea%20materials/10%20principles%20of%20juche.html">governing rules</a> of North Korea, imply that the supreme leadership must stay within the Kim family.</p>
<p>“We must pass down the great achievement of the revolution by the 
Great Leader comrade Kim Il-sung from generation to generation, 
inheriting and completing it to the end,” the 10th principle says. 
However, due to the lack of specific information on the Kim family, it 
is difficult to ascertain who in the family would be a lead contender.</p>
<p>Kim has eliminated many of his close relatives, narrowing the number 
of possible successors from the Kim family. Jang Song-thaek, Kim’s uncle
 and second-in-command of the North Korean military, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/north-korea-executes-kim-jong-un-uncle-jang-song-thaek">was executed</a>
 on Kim’s orders in 2013 for “treachery.” Song-thaek was stripped of all
 official rank and positions within the North Korean government and he 
was digitally removed from pictures with other North Korean leaders. Kim
 is also widely believed to have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kim-jong-uns-assassinated-half-brother-contacts-cia/story?id=63632940">ordered</a>
 the 2017 assassination of his older half-brother Kim Jong-nam with the 
nerve agent VX in Malaysia. Jong-nam had been first in line to succeed 
his father until he fell out of favor after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/the-sad-life-and-even-sadder-end-of-kim-jong-nam/2017/02/24/7fb591fc-f941-11e6-aa1e-5f735ee31334_story.html">trying to visit</a> Tokyo Disneyland in 2001.</p>
<p>It is still unclear how many wives or children either Kim Il Sung or 
Kim Jong Il had. Kim Jong Un currently has only one confirmed wife, Ri 
Sol Ju, and is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-jong-un-heirs-what-we-know-2017-12">believed to have</a>
 three children with her. The direct succession from father to son is 
well established, and would most likely continue after Kim’s death if he
 has a son. However, the oldest known child of Kim and his wife, 
reportedly a son, was born in 2010, making him far too young to take 
over the country if Kim dies soon.</p>
<p>There has been <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/who-kim-jong-uns-sister-north-korea-leaders-reported-health-problems-push-kim-yo-jong-focus-1499135">speculation</a>
 that Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, could take over the country in the 
event of her brother’s early death. She is considered to be largely 
responsible for Kim’s public relations efforts. Yo Jong became the first
 member of the Kim family to visit South Korea since the Korean War when
 she <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2018/02/11/north-korea-olympics-mainstream-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer">attended</a>
 the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, meeting with Vice President 
Mike Pence and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Yo Jong also <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/12/21/trump-details-negotiations-north-korea-new-book/" rel="noopener noreferrer">participated</a> in the 2018 U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore and the 2019 summit in Hanoi, Vietnam.</p>
<p>Though some women from the Kim family have achieved reverential 
status among the North Korean people, most notably Kim Il Sung’s wife, 
and communism preaches equality of gender, North Korea <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/north-korea">remains</a> a largely patriarchal society.</p>
<p>And the succession of a woman to the position of supreme leader is unlikely given current North Korean cultural attitudes.</p>
<p>The most likely person to take power in the event of Kim’s death is Vice Marshal Choe Ryong-hae.</p>
<p>Ryong-hae previously served as the second-in-command of the North Korean military and is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-politics-succession-factbo/factbox-questions-hang-over-north-korea-succession-amid-reports-on-kim-health-idUSKBN223110">currently</a>
 the president of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly, the 
council of executive officers that oversees North Korea’s legislative 
body. He also serves as one of the vice chairmen of the Workers’ Party 
of Korea. In October 2017, Ryong-hae was <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm568">appointed</a>
 director of the Organization and Guidance Department (OGD), the agency 
for all state censorship. Up until the appointment of Ryong-hae, 
directors of the OGD were exclusively members of the Kim family, 
possibly indicating his power within the regime.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are over a dozen other vice chairmen of the 
Workers’ Party of Korea who also hold other government posts and 
military officers who could gather enough support to become contenders 
for the leadership position.</p>
<p>Speculation about political power structures within North Korea is 
difficult since very little information about the inner workings of the 
North Korean government has reached the West and it is unclear which 
officials other than the supreme leader have strong enough 
constituencies or formal power within the government to actually wield 
power. <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/15/north-korea-biden-kim-jong-un/" rel="noopener noreferrer">(RELATED: North Korea Says Biden Should Be Beaten ‘With A Stick’ For Calling Kim Jong Un A ‘Murderous Dictator’)</a></p>
<p>Given the special reverence for the Kim family in North Korea, Kim’s 
official successor would most likely be one of his children. However, if
 none of his children are old enough to control the country when Kim 
dies, one of the top-ranking officials within the government, such as 
Ryong-hae or Pyong So, might rule the country as an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-politics-succession-factbo/factbox-questions-hang-over-north-korea-succession-amid-reports-on-kim-health-idUSKBN223110">unofficial regent</a>
 until the younger Kim comes of age. Control over a young Kim successor 
might result in political instability and factionalism within the North 
Korean state as different officials engage in political intrigue to gain
 favor with or control over Kim’s successor.</p>
<p>However, even if he is incapacitated by health problems, Kim is unlikely to be <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/keeping-kim-how-north-koreas-regime-stays-power" rel="noopener noreferrer">removed from power</a> by top government officials before his actual death.</p>
<p>The Kim regime has effectively rendered itself immune to internal 
coups by installing officials in positions of power based on loyalty 
instead of competence and creating numerous competing commissions, 
committees and departments with overlapping jurisdictions and varying 
degrees of power over state affairs.</p>
<p>This structure may look like bureaucratic inefficiency, but it works 
to play each of these power bases off against each other instead of 
against the supreme leader. Without any clear chain of command within 
the North Korean government outside of the supreme leader, a massive 
power struggle among the top party officials in North Korea would be 
almost guaranteed without a clear line of succession. This fragile 
political equilibrium that is only maintained by a Kim, along with the 
fanatical cult of personality around the Kim family, discourages any 
political opposition from openly forming or trying to stage a coup to 
remove Kim from power.</p>
<p>If Kim Jong Un dies before naming an official heir or before one of 
his children reaches maturity, the political situation in North Korea 
could become extremely volatile, placing its nuclear weapons at risk and
 increasing the chance of destabilization in the region.</p>
