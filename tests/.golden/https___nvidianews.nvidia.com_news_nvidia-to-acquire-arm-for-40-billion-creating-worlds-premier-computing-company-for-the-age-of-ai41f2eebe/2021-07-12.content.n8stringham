<p>NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp. (SBG) today announced a definitive 
agreement under which NVIDIA will acquire Arm Limited from SBG and the 
SoftBank Vision Fund (together, “SoftBank”) in a transaction valued at 
$40 billion. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to 
NVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP earnings per share.</p>
<p>The combination brings together NVIDIA’s leading AI computing 
platform with Arm’s vast ecosystem to create the premier computing 
company for the age of artificial intelligence, accelerating innovation 
while expanding into large, high-growth markets. SoftBank will remain 
committed to Arm’s long-term success through its ownership stake in 
NVIDIA, expected to be under 10 percent.</p>
<p>“AI is the most powerful technology force of our time and has 
launched a new wave of computing,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of
 NVIDIA. “In the years ahead, trillions of computers running AI will 
create a new internet-of-things that is thousands of times larger than 
today’s internet-of-people. Our combination will create a company 
fabulously positioned for the age of AI.</p>
<p>“Simon Segars and his team at Arm have built an extraordinary company
 that is contributing to nearly every technology market in the world. 
Uniting NVIDIA’s AI computing capabilities with the vast ecosystem of 
Arm’s CPU, we can advance computing from the cloud, smartphones, PCs, 
self-driving cars and robotics, to edge IoT, and expand AI computing to 
every corner of the globe.</p>
<p>“This combination has tremendous benefits for both companies, our 
customers, and the industry. For Arm’s ecosystem, the combination will 
turbocharge Arm’s R&amp;D capacity and expand its IP portfolio with 
NVIDIA’s world-leading GPU and AI technology.</p>
<p>“Arm will remain headquartered in Cambridge. We will expand on this 
great site and build a world-class AI research facility, supporting 
developments in healthcare, life sciences, robotics, self-driving cars 
and other fields. And, to attract researchers and scientists from the 
U.K. and around the world to conduct groundbreaking work, NVIDIA will 
build a state-of-the-art AI supercomputer, powered by Arm CPUs. Arm 
Cambridge will be a world-class technology center.”</p>
<p>“NVIDIA is the perfect partner for Arm,” said Masayoshi Son, chairman
 and CEO of SBG. “Since acquiring Arm, we have honored our commitments 
and invested heavily in people, technology and R&amp;D, thereby 
expanding the business into new areas with high growth potential. 
Joining forces with a world leader in technology innovation creates new 
and exciting opportunities for Arm. This is a compelling combination 
that projects Arm, Cambridge and the U.K. to the forefront of some of 
the most exciting technological innovations of our time and is why 
SoftBank is excited to invest in Arm’s long-term success as a major 
shareholder in NVIDIA. We look forward to supporting the continued 
success of the combined business.”</p>
<p>“Arm and NVIDIA share a vision and passion that ubiquitous, 
energy-efficient computing will help address the world’s most pressing 
issues from climate change to healthcare, from agriculture to 
education,” said Simon Segars, CEO of Arm. “Delivering on this vision 
requires new approaches to hardware and software and a long-term 
commitment to research and development. By bringing together the 
technical strengths of our two companies we can accelerate our progress 
and create new solutions that will enable a global ecosystem of 
innovators. My management team and I are excited to be joining NVIDIA so
 we can write this next chapter together.”</p>
<p>Commitment to Arm and the UK</p>
<p> As part of NVIDIA, Arm will continue to operate its open-licensing 
model while maintaining the global customer neutrality that has been 
foundational to its success, with 180 billion chips shipped to-date by 
its licensees. Arm partners will also benefit from both companies’ 
offerings, including NVIDIA’s numerous innovations.</p>
<p>SoftBank and Arm are fully committed to satisfying the undertakings 
made by SoftBank when it acquired Arm in 2016, which are scheduled to 
complete in September 2021. Following the closing of the transaction, 
NVIDIA intends to retain the name and strong brand identity of Arm and 
expand its base in Cambridge. Arm’s intellectual property will remain 
registered in the U.K. </p>
<p>NVIDIA will build on Arm’s R&amp;D presence in the U.K., establishing
 a new global center of excellence in AI research at Arm’s Cambridge 
campus. NVIDIA will invest in a state-of-the-art, Arm-powered AI 
supercomputer, training facilities for developers and a startup 
incubator, which will attract world-class research talent and create a 
platform for innovation and industry partnerships in fields such as 
healthcare, robotics and self-driving cars. </p>
<p class="">Additional Transaction Details </p>
<p> Under the terms of the transaction, which has been approved by the 
boards of directors of NVIDIA, SBG and Arm, NVIDIA will pay to SoftBank a
 total of $21.5 billion in NVIDIA common stock and $12 billion in cash, 
which includes $2 billion payable at signing. The number of NVIDIA 
shares to be issued at closing is 44.3 million, determined using the 
average closing price of NVIDIA common stock for the last 30 trading 
days. Additionally, SoftBank may receive up to $5 billion in cash or 
common stock under an earn-out construct, subject to satisfaction of 
specific financial performance targets by Arm.</p>
<p>NVIDIA will also issue $1.5 billion in equity to Arm employees.</p>
<p>NVIDIA intends to finance the cash portion of the transaction with 
balance sheet cash. The transaction does not include Arm’s IoT Services 
Group.</p>
<p>The proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, 
including the receipt of regulatory approvals for the U.K., China, the 
European Union and the United States. Completion of the transaction is 
expected to take place in approximately 18 months.</p>
<p>Conference Call and Webcast Details </p>
<p> NVIDIA will conduct a webcast at 5:30 a.m. PT on Monday, September 
14, to discuss the transaction. The webcast is available on NVIDIA’s 
Investor Relations website at <a href="https://investor.nvidia.com/" rel="nofollow">https://investor.nvidia.com/</a>. A webcast replay and a copy of the webcast presentation materials will also be available at <a href="https://investor.nvidia.com/" rel="nofollow">https://investor.nvidia.com/</a>.</p>

receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals; the potential 
for regulatory authorities to require divestitures, behavioral remedies

effect of the announcement or pendency of the transaction on NVIDIA’s

delays, disruptions or increased costs in the integration of Arm’s 
technology in existing or new products; expected financial benefits and 
other benefits of the transaction may not be realized; integration of 
the acquisition post-closing may not occur as anticipated, and the 
combined company’s ability to achieve the growth prospects and synergies

 or limitations or restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities may

costs may be incurred or undisclosed liabilities assumed; attempts to 
retain key personnel and customers may not succeed; risks related to 
diverting management’s attention from NVIDIA’s ongoing business

 the documents that NVIDIA files with the SEC on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 
8-K. These filings identify and address other important risks and

uncertainties that relate more broadly to NVIDIA’s overall business, 
including those more fully described in NVIDIA’s filings with the SEC.

otherwise. NVIDIA can give no assurance that the conditions to the 
transaction will be satisfied.</p>
