<p>NEW YORK — There are 48 bodies in the basement of the funeral home in
 Harlem. Forty are in cardboard boxes, ready for cremation. The other 
eight are in the refrigerator, to be embalmed and buried. It will be 
weeks or months before they get either.</p>
<p>As health officials began burying COVID-19 victims <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/10/de-blasio-admits-coronavirus-victims-are-buried-on-hart-island/">in a mass grave on Hart Island</a>
 during New York’s worst week of death, the four female undertakers at 
the International Funeral &amp; Cremation Service started turning bodies
 away.</p>
<p>This band of women morticians in heeled boots began to feel like they
 were failing. The way they see it, a person should get what they want 
in death, even if that was never possible in life.</p>
<p>“That’s our thing,” says Lily Sage Weinrieb. “You want six limos and 
you want them painted pink? Yes. Now, we’re like: you want a cremation? 
I’m sorry, no. You want a burial and you already have a plot and 
everything? Sorry, no. We don’t have any room.”</p>
<p>“You see tons of body bags and tons of people and they’re labeled COVID-19, COVID-19, COVID-19. It’s like a horror show.”</p>
<p><span> - Nicole Warring</span></p>
<p>“We’re being told that we’re heroes for being on the front lines of this but I feel like I’m failing families every day.”</p>
<p>On the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, nurses and doctors are caring for the living. But there is <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/11/nyc-funeral-directors-bemoan-red-tape-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/">another front line of those caring for the dead</a>.
 They fear they can also get infected and die. Some of them have sent 
their own children to live with relatives. And because American cities 
like New York were never designed to dispose of so many dead, their call
 of duty will last much longer.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, Alisha Narvaez, 36, sent her 
17-year-old daughter to live with her twin sister, but after two weeks 
the distance was too much. “It’s always just been me and her and she 
wanted to come home,” says Alisha.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Alisha showers at the funeral home after embalmings
 and before going home, then removes all of her clothes in the hallway 
and showers again when she gets home. She sprays her bag with Lysol and 
rinses her mouth out with Listerine.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“I gotta make sure I keep healthy just not to harm 
her,” says Alisha. “Although she’s been in quarantine for several weeks,
 every day I come home from work is Day Zero for her.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Jenny Adames sent her daughter to live with her mother. She recently caught herself snapping at her in a text exchange.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“Today kind of broke my heart,” says Jenny, 36. “She needs her mom. She don’t need Jenny the funeral director.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Nicole Warring, 33, worries about dying, or 
infecting her 10-year-old son. Her boyfriend who works for the casket 
company got the virus. Fortunately, he recovered. She was off of work 
for a week for heart palpitations from anxiety.</p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"><span>Reuters</span></figcaption><p class="rm-manual">“It’s traumatizing for everyone,” she says. “No mortuary school can prepare you for what we’re seeing now.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Lily moved out of a shared house with friends in 
Philadelphia because she didn’t think it was right to constantly expose 
her housemates to the virus. Her parents let her move home but she says 
no one has hugged her for more than a month.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“That sucks,” she says.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Several nights each week Lily, 25, sleeps in the chapel at the funeral home.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Buying time</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Jenny doesn’t remember the first body she turned 
away in the pandemic but she does remember the first one that made her 
cry. A man called — every hour, at least four times in one day — about 
his friend lying dead in a nursing home.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“I need help,” she recalls him saying. “I don’t 
know what to do. I don’t want to leave him to be thrown in a potter’s 
field. Please, you gotta help me Jenny.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“I really couldn’t do anything and that broke my 
heart,” says Jenny. “It’s not that we are turning you away. We just need
 to buy time.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The death toll in the United States is now the 
highest in the world. A third of U.S. deaths, more than 13,000, have 
been in New York City.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">New York, the most-populous city in the United States, has just four crematories.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Death in a pandemic isn’t pretty. The <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/18/coronavirus-in-ny-some-trucks-storing-bodies-are-dark-dirty-packed/">refrigerated trailers outside of the hospitals</a>
 don’t have enough shelving and bodies are sometimes stacked on top of 
each other and on the floor. Some trailers don’t have lights.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Hospitals, which used to store bodies for 14 days now sometimes will only keep them for six.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“You have 20 other funeral directors ahead of you that have to get bodies out,” says Nicole.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“You see tons of body bags and tons of people and they’re labeled COVID-19, COVID-19, COVID-19. It’s like a horror show.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">And little stands between the women and the risks their work carries. No one even knows if the bodies of victims are contagious.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Two weeks ago, the women ran out of gloves.</p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"><span>Jenny Adames, 36, applies makeup to 
her aunt, a suspected COVID-19 victim, with the assistance of her cousin
 Vanessa Fernandez, before her aunt’s viewing service.</span><span>Reuters</span></figcaption><p class="rm-manual">In
 that shortage, Jenny found an unexpected detente with the father of her
 daughter. “We hate each other,” she explains, but says she turned to 
him for help because he works in a hospital. He brought her gloves, a 
box of masks and an apron.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“I don’t really like you much but you’re my daughter’s mother. Here you go,” he told her.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The phones in the funeral parlor ring constantly, 
punctuated by ambulance sirens. Suppliers say they are running out of 
caskets and urns. Jenny says she no longer hands families the casket 
catalog; she just asks what color.</p>

It's unprecedented and unanticipated." </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Last goodbyes</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Most COVID-19 victims die alone, and when they die,
 their families are told to quarantine. The women try to find ways for 
them to say goodbye.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Jenny gives families her mobile number. They text her late into the night.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">For those who are cremated, Lily offers to let the families pour the ashes into the urn and say a few words.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The funeral home in Harlem is one of the few 
allowing viewings for COVID-19 victims. Because of the pandemic, only 10
 people can gather at a time; most families are bigger so the women 
offer four-hour viewings, 10 people per hour. Families have to bring 
their own gloves and masks.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Jenny says the women have to watch each other right
 now. The message, she says, is “limit your compassion please, because 
we gotta move onto the next one. There’s no time to stop.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Jenny’s grandfather died of the coronavirus on 
April 6. A week later, on Good Friday, her aunt died. “Suspected 
COVID-19,” her death certificate read. They were family so Jenny took 
care of both of them herself.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“I’m not the emotional type to tell you the truth,” she says. “I don’t want to sound heartless but it’s a job. It’s what I do.”</p>
