<h1 class="rm-manual">Twenty Years and Counting</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> Submitted by <span>masson</span> on Fri, 2017-12-22 06:13 </p>
<h4 class="">The third decade of open source software starts in February 2018. How did it rise to dominance, and what’s next?</h4>
<p>20 years ago, in February 1998, the term “open source” was first 
applied to software, Soon afterwards, the Open Source Definition was 
created and the seeds that became the Open Source Initiative (OSI) were 
sown. As the OSD’s author Bruce Perens <a href="https://perens.com/2017/09/26/on-usage-of-the-phrase-open-source/">relates</a>,</p>
<blockquote>“Open Source” is the proper name of a campaign to promote 
the pre-existing concept of Free Software to business, and to certify 
licenses to a rule set.</blockquote>
<p>Twenty years later, that campaign has proven wildly successful, 
beyond the imagination of anyone involved at the time. Today open source
 software is literally everywhere. It is the foundation for the Internet
 and for the worldwide web. It powers the computers and mobile devices 
we all use, as well as the networks they connect to. Without it, cloud 
computing and the nascent Internet of Things would be impossible to 
scale and perhaps to create. It has allowed new ways of doing business 
to be tested and proven, allowing giant corporations like Google and 
Facebook to start from the top of a mountain others already climbed.</p>
<p>Like any human creation, it has a dark side as well. It has also 
unlocked dystopian possibilities for surveillance and the inevitably 
consequent authoritarian control. It has provided criminals with new 
ways to cheat their victims and unleashed the darkness of bullying 
delivered anonymously and at scale. It allows destructive fanatics to 
organise in secret without the inconvenience of meeting. All of these 
are shadows cast by useful capabilities, just as every human tool 
through history has been useful both to feed and care and to harm and 
control. We need to help the upcoming generation to strive for 
irreproachable innovation. As Richard Feynman <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/07/19/richard-feynman-science-morality-poem/">quoted</a>,</p>
<blockquote>To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven. The same key opens the gates of hell.</blockquote>
<p>As open source has matured, so the way it is discussed and understood
 has also matured. The first decade was one of advocacy and controversy,
 while the second was marked by adoption and adaptation. </p>
<ol>
<li>In the first decade, the key question concerned business models – 
“how can I contribute freely yet still be paid”, while during the second
 more people asked about governance – “how can I participate yet keep 
control/not be controlled”.</li> <li>Open source projects of the first 
decade were predominantly replacements for off-the-shelf products, while
 in the second decade they were increasingly components of larger 
solutions</li>. <li>Projects of the first decade were often run by 
informal groups of individuals, while in the second decade they were 
frequently run by charities created on a project-by-project basis.</li> <li>Open
 source developers of the first decade were frequently devoted to a 
single project and often worked in their spare time. In the second 
decade, they were increasingly employed to work on a specific technology
 – professional specialists.</li> <li>While open source was always 
intended as a way to promote software freedom, during the first decade 
conflict arose with those preferring the term “free software”. In the 
second decade this conflict was largely ignored as open source adoption 
accelerated.</li> <p>So what will the third decade bring? </p>
<ol>
<li>The Complexity Business Model — The predominant business model will 
involve monetising the solution of the complexity arising from the 
integration of many open source parts, especially from deployment and 
scaling. Governance needs will reflect this.</li> <li>Open Source 
Mosaics — Open source projects will be predominantly families of 
component parts, together being built into stacks of components. The 
resultant larger solutions will be a mosaic of open source parts.</li> <li>Families
 Of Projects — More and more projects will be hosted by consortia/trade 
associations like the Linux Foundation and OpenStack and by general 
purpose charities like Apache and the Software Freedom Conservancy.</li> <li>Professional
 Generalists — Open source developers will increasingly be employed to 
integrate many technologies into complex solutions and will contribute 
in a range of projects.</li> <li>Software Freedom Redux — As new 
problems arise, software freedom (the application of the Four Freedoms 
to user and developer flexibility) will increasingly be applied to 
identify solutions that work for collaborative communities and 
independent deployers.</li> <p>I’ll be expounding on all this in conference keynotes around the world during 2018.
