<p>Seventeen years after SARS killed 44 Canadians and sickened hundreds 
of others, Canadian officials are closely monitoring a new potential 
threat — a mysterious virus based in China that has caused atypical 
pneumonia in at least 59 people.</p>
<p>So far, Chinese officials have ruled out SARS (Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome), which also began in China in 2002. They have also
 ruled out bird flu, influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, 
among other potential causes. Officials say there is no evidence yet 
that it has spread from human to human.</p>

<span>Canadian officials closely monitoring mysterious virus based in China</span> <span>Back to video</span>
</h5>
<p>But the world is watching closely. Not just because there are so many
 unanswered questions about the cluster of undiagnosed viral pneumonia 
cases in Wuhan, China, but because global infectious disease officials 
have long warned that another pandemic is coming.</p>
<p>Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam has been in 
touch with provincial and territorial public health officials, the World
 Health Organization and other international partners to discuss the 
mysterious virus, said Eric Morrissette, spokesman for the Public Health
 Agency of Canada.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Advertisement</h2>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Article content continued</h2>
<p>The Ontario Ministry of Health is also monitoring the situation, said spokesman David Jensen.</p>
<p>“As the situation develops, the ministry will continue to assess and 
determine whether any further action is needed,” said Jensen.</p>
<p>Could this become a global public health threat? For now, public 
health officials are watching and trying to get more information.</p>
<p>But the virus in Wuhan should serve as a wakeup call about the 
implications of overcrowding in Ontario hospitals for outbreaks or a 
pandemic, said Dr. Alan Drummond, a Perth emergency physician who is 
co-chair of public affairs for the Canadian Association of Emergency 
Physicians.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Advertisement</h2>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Article content continued</h2>
<p>Ontario is not ready for such a public health crisis, said Drummond, 
who has been raising awareness about hospital overcrowding in the 
province and across Canada. Drummond said Ontario would be highly 
vulnerable during a new pandemic because of chronically overcrowded 
hospitals.</p>
<p>A Public Health Agency of Canada spokesman notes that numerous system
 improvements have been put in place since the SARS outbreak, which 
killed 774 people worldwide, 44 of them in Toronto. Those changes 
include new and improved systems in Canadian provinces and territories 
to “identify, prevent and control the spread of serious infectious 
diseases into and within Canada.”</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Advertisement</h2>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Article content continued</h2>
<p>Post-SARS protections also include a global public health 
intelligence monitoring system, which scans the world’s open source 
media, in addition to international collaboration and information 
sharing across Canada, said Morrissette.</p>
<p>“The Canadian public health laboratory system is well-equipped to detect serious infectious diseases,” he added.</p>
<p>Other post-SARS changes include screening patients coming into 
emergency rooms for infectious diseases and having rooms designed to 
contain infectious patients.</p>
<p>Those kinds of initiatives are positive, said Drummond, but do not overcome the lack of space in hospitals.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Advertisement</h2>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Article content continued</h2>
<p>“I would worry greatly that the best laid plans of mice and men are going to be scuppered because we do not have bed capacity.”</p>
<p>Hospitals are so overcrowded that Drummond said he could foresee 
military tents having to be set up in some hospital parking lots to deal
 with surge capacity if Ontario was hit by a serious pandemic.</p>
<p>In order to have safe occupancy rates and allow for busier periods, 
Drummond said hospitals should be operating around 85 per cent capacity 
most of the time. But in Ontario, most hospitals are closer to 100 per 
cent capacity or higher. In Ottawa, that has had a cascading impact on 
ambulances, which have been forced to repeatedly declare Code Zero, 
meaning no ambulances are available, because paramedics are waiting for 
patients to be admitted.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Advertisement</h2>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Article content continued</h2>
<p>“The Code Zeroes for ambulances are bad now. How bad is it going to be if we have a pandemic?”</p>
<p>The Ontario Hospital Association recently published a report 
outlining the impact of years of flatlined and insufficient funding for 
hospitals in the province and noted that Ontario has fewer hospital beds
 per 1,000 people than any other Canadian province and fewer beds than 
any other country in the world except Mexico, with which it is tied.</p>
<p>The report said Ontario’s hospitals are the most efficient in the country but the worsening situation is not sustainable.</p>
<p>The Ontario Hospital Association report cites population growth and 
an aging population as two reasons for increasing waits at emergency 
departments across the province.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Advertisement</h2>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Article content continued</h2>
<p class="">Drummond said demographics are not the only reason to be 
concerned about long wait times in emergency departments, overcapacity 
hospitals and hallway healthcare. Hospitals also have to be concerned 
about “what is lurking in the shadows” — the possibility of a future 
pandemic.</p>
<p>Most hospitals have no wiggle room, he said.</p>
<p class="">“That is my concern. We talk about the patient in the 
hallway and the misery of crowded waiting rooms. But when we say no 
surge capacity what we mean is one major epidemic and we are screwed.”</p>
