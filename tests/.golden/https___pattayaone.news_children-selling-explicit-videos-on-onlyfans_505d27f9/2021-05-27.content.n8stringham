<h1 class="rm-manual">Children selling explicit videos on OnlyFans</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span>by <span><a href="https://pattayaone.news/author/dave-d/">Dave D</a></span></span><span>May 27, 2021May 27, 2021</span> </p>
<p>British subscription site OnlyFans is failing to prevent underage 
users from selling and appearing in explicit videos, a BBC investigation
 has found.</p>
<p>Under-18s have used fake identification to set up accounts, and police say a 14-year-old used a grandmother’s passport.</p>
<p>The UK’s most senior police officer for child protection also says children are being “exploited” on the platform.</p>
<p>OnlyFans says its age verification systems go over and above regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The platform has more than a million “creators”, who share video 
clips, photos and messages directly to subscribers on a monthly basis. 
Teaser videos or photographs for accounts are often promoted on Twitter 
and Instagram.</p>
<p>In return for hosting the material, OnlyFans takes a 20% share of all payments.</p>
<p>Warning: Story contains adult themes and language</p>
<p>There is a range of content on the site but it is best known for pornography, and requires users to be over 18.</p>
<p>OnlyFans was a big winner during the pandemic, exploding in 
popularity as much of the world was housebound. The social media 
platform has grown nearly 10-fold since 2019, and now has more than 120 
million users.</p>
<p>Some creators have become millionaires from their accounts, yet for 
most it has been a lifeline or a second income during the pandemic.</p>
<p>But BBC News has investigated concerns that under-18s are selling 
explicit videos on the site, despite it being illegal for individuals to
 post or share indecent images of children.</p>
<p>As part of our investigation, we found that one 17-year-old from a 
suburb in the south-east of England had sold videos of herself 
masturbating and playing with sex toys, while an under-18 participated 
in graphic videos hosted on an adult account in Nevada, US, in breach of
 the company’s terms and conditions.</p>
<p>We were also able to set up an account for an underage creator, by 
using a 26-year-old’s identification, showing how the site’s 
age-verification process could be cheated.</p>
<p>OnlyFans says it has now shut down the accounts. </p>
<p>But BBC News has also heard from child protection experts across the 
UK and US, spoken to dozens of police forces and schools, and obtained 
anonymised Childline counsellor notes, about underage experiences on 
OnlyFans. </p>
<p>The notes included one girl who told counsellors she had accessed the site when she was just 13.</p>
<p>These sources told BBC News about a number of serious cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schools have shared anonymous reports of pupils using the site, 
including a 16-year-old who boasted to her careers adviser about the 
amount of money she made on the site, and showed off her “exuberant” 
spending on Instagram.</li>
<li>Underage creators and users of the site include victims of prior 
sexual abuse and those with mental health issues and suicidal thoughts, 
according to Childline counsellor notes.</li>
<li>UK police forces say children have complained about their images 
being uploaded to the site without consent, and one 17-year-old reported
 being blackmailed.</li>
<li>Missing children are appearing in OnlyFans videos, according to a US
 watchdog, which also says it has received reports of child sexual 
exploitation.</li>
</ul>
<p>“It is increasingly clear that OnlyFans is being used by children,” 
says chief constable Simon Bailey, the UK’s child protection lead.</p>
<p>“The company is not doing enough to put in place the safeguards that 
prevent children exploiting the opportunity to generate money, but also 
for children to be exploited.”</p>
<p>In a statement, OnlyFans says it could not respond specifically to 
the anonymous reports we were told about without the account details.</p>
<p>It says its efforts to stop children accessing its site limits the 
likelihood of them being exposed to blackmail or exploitation, and if it
 is notified about these behaviours it takes swift action and disables 
accounts.</p>
<h2>It started with feet photos</h2>
<p>Leah, 17, was able to set up an account using a fake drivers licence and sell explicit videos.</p>
<p>She told her mum Caitlyn about being on OnlyFans, on the way to Tesco’s near their home in south-east England in January.</p>
<p>That week Leah’s bank account had been frozen after she received a 
payment of more than £5,000 from selling explicit videos on the site, 
Caitlyn says.</p>
<p>Caitlyn says she was as shocked as “any parent” would be. “I don’t 
understand why people are paying so much money for this,” she told the 
BBC.</p>
<p>Leah had “big issues” growing up and missed a lot of education, 
Caitlyn says. Naked photographs of her were once shared around school 
without her consent.</p>
<p>She told her mum she originally intended to only post pictures of her
 feet after making money selling them on Snapchat. But this soon 
escalated to explicit videos of her masturbating and playing with sex 
toys.</p>
<p>In tweets advertising her OnlyFans account – some of which include 
teaser videos – people call her “beautiful” and “sexy”, and ask if she 
would meet up.</p>
<p>“Post a pussy shot and I’ll subscribe,” is another typical response.</p>
<p>Caitlyn says she doesn’t approve of her daughter using the site, but 
can see why people go on it, given how much money can be made.</p>
<p>Leah used most of the money to buy presents for her boyfriend, 
including more than £1,000 on designer clothes. They have since broken 
up.</p>
<p>In a statement, OnlyFans said that Leah’s ability to access the site 
was an “oversight”, and her fake drivers license did not trigger a red 
flag. </p>
<p>It said her account was approved during a transition “from one 
effective ID and age verification system to a new exceptionally 
effective” one.</p>
<p>Leah’s age was directly reported to OnlyFans by an anonymous social media account in late January.</p>
<p> The company says this led to a moderator reviewing the account and 
double-checking her ID. As it appeared legitimate, no further action was
 taken.</p>
<p>Caitlyn says it was stated “everywhere” on other online accounts that
 her daughter was 17. There is no obligation for a website to 
investigate, but OnlyFans told the BBC it checks social media when 
verifying accounts.</p>
<p>Leah stopped posting on OnlyFans, but her account remained active on 
the site four months later, with more than 50 archived pictures and 
videos. She had logged on as recently as late April.</p>
<p>After being contacted by BBC News, OnlyFans shut down her page. It 
says it has also refunded all active subscriptions to her account. But 
images from her account have already been leaked all across the 
internet.</p>
<p>Leah’s now anxious about leaving the house for fear of being 
recognised, her mum says. Her plans to go to college have been delayed.</p>
<p>“She won’t go out at all, really,” Caitlyn says. “She doesn’t want to be seen.”</p>
<h2>Grandmother’s passport</h2>
<p>BBC News also heard of other cases of underage children gaining access to OnlyFans.</p>
<p>Hertfordshire Police told us that a 14-year-old girl had managed to 
use her grandmother’s passport and bank details to sell explicit images.
 They say she then redirected money from that account to her own.</p>
<p>OnlyFans says the account was “fraudulent” and involved the help of 
others. The site says it is assisting police and has since updated its 
age-verification system to “further reduce the chance” of this happening
 again.</p>
<p>But BBC News tested the site’s “new exceptionally effective” system 
in April. While a fake ID did not work, we were able to set up an 
OnlyFans account for a 17-year-old by using her 26-year-old sister’s 
passport. The girl never had access to the account.</p>
<p>The site requires applicants to pose next to an ID card and then 
submit a photograph holding it up to their face. But the age 
verification system failed to distinguish between them at any stage of 
the process, despite the age gap.</p>
<p>After setting up an account, creators must provide bank details to 
receive payment through OnlyFans. However, this does not prevent them 
posting images and videos.</p>
<p>BBC News has found that creators can share content and then arrange 
payments through alternative providers, in violation of company 
guidelines. </p>
<p>One of the most popular is Cash App, which allows users to transfer 
money by mobile phone. We found scores of accounts advertising this.</p>
<p>We were then able to send a direct message to a subscriber and 
request payment through Cash App, using a common alternative spelling 
(Ca$happ).</p>
<p>OnlyFans says its list of prohibited words on the site already 
includes a number of variations of “Cash App”. It says this list has now
 been expanded.</p>
<h2>‘Sucked into’ appearing in videos</h2>
<p>OnlyFans requires creators making “co-authored” material to have 
documentation showing that all participants are over 18 years old. All 
contributors must also be registered creators on the site.</p>
<p>BBC News has discovered that under-18s are also appearing in explicit
 videos on accounts run by adults in violation of OnlyFans’ guidelines.</p>
<p>Aaron was 17 when he started making videos on the site with his girlfriend in Nevada, US.</p>
<p>According to his friend Jordan, Aaron didn’t have his own account, 
but instead “got sucked into” appearing in explicit videos posted by his
 girlfriend, Cody, who was a year older than him.</p>
<p>Aaron soon started bragging about the amount of money he was making. “He was actually very proud of doing it,” Jordan says.</p>
<p>The content included sex filmed in one of their bedrooms. They shared $5,000 between them from a single video, his friends say.</p>
<p>“[He] was elated that they were making such an amazing amount of 
money for just having sex on camera for other people to watch,” says a 
woman who has known Aaron for many years.</p>
<p>She says he had a tough childhood and was “very vulnerable to 
exploitation”. Cody had previously showered him with gifts on his 16th 
birthday, and admitted to earning the money by selling nudes online “to 
some old guy”, she added.</p>
<p>Jordan says Aaron had encouraged him to make videos on OnlyFans, even though he was also underage.</p>
<p>“He used to say: ‘Bro, you can do it, we make so much money a week, it’s easy, you don’t have to work ever.'”</p>
<p>BBC News was told the account was reported to police in the US in 
October 2020 but had not been removed until we contacted OnlyFans about 
the case this month.</p>
<p>In its response, OnlyFans says all active subscriptions would now be 
refunded. It said it is now liaising with the police, but had not 
previously been contacted about the account.</p>
<p>Aaron is now 18 and has broken up with Cody. His friends say he now plans to begin his own OnlyFans account.</p>
<h2>Boasting to careers adviser</h2>
<p>As a part of the investigation, we also spoke to schools, police 
forces and child protection experts who told us they are hearing from 
under 18-year-olds whose experiences on the site have had serious 
consequences.</p>
<p>One school in London says it became aware of the site after a 
16-year-old pupil openly boasted to her careers adviser about how much 
money she was making from it, asking why she should listen to their 
advice.</p>
<p>The girl later revealed to staff that she had been posting “very 
sexualised, pornographic” images, says the school’s head of 
safeguarding, who also told us about a 12 year-old girl who said she had
 used the site to contact adult creators and asked to meet up.</p>
<p>The deputy head asked to be anonymous to protect the identities of the children.</p>
<p>He said the 16-year-old girl had used Instagram to show-off her “exuberant” spending and build a large number of followers.</p>
<p>Childline counsellors have come across a number of cases in which 
under-18s reference their use of OnlyFans. It shared extracts of those 
notes with BBC News, which detail accounts of vulnerable under-18s using
 the site.</p>
<p>Children using the site who contacted the service reported being 
victims of prior sexual abuse, while others presented “mental health 
issues including anger, low self-esteem, self-harm and suicide 
ideation”.</p>
<p>One girl told a counsellor she had been on OnlyFans since she was 13.</p>
<h2>Information and support</h2>
<p>“I don’t wanna talk about the types of pictures I post on there and I
 know it’s not appropriate for kids my age to be doing this, but it’s an
 easy way to make money,” she said according to the notes, which have 
identifying details removed.</p>
<p>“Some of the girls have thousands of followers on Instagram and they 
must be raking it in,” she added. “I wanna be just like them.”</p>
<p>While most of Childline’s cases referred to girls, counsellors also 
heard from boys who said they subscribed to the site, including one who 
said it had affected his opinions of sex.</p>
<p>Another, who was 16, said he had lost sleep and was “worried to the 
point of throwing up” about someone discovering he had bought nudes on 
the site.</p>
<p>Because the reports were provided to the BBC without any identifying 
details of the children or OnlyFans accounts in question, we were unable
 to provide the platform with account names. It said it could not 
comment on the cases without those details.</p>
<p>It also said it manually reviews every application to stop under-age 
access, and has increased staffing numbers in compliance, in line with 
the growth of the site.</p>
<h2>Missing children</h2>
<p>The UK’s national lead for child protection policing Chief Constable 
Simon Bailey, says it is “increasingly clear” that OnlyFans is being 
used by children.</p>
<p>While it is illegal to post or share explicit images of someone under
 the age of 18, Mr Bailey says the police are extremely reluctant to 
criminalise children for such offences. </p>
<p>He says he is more concerned about the risks children are exposing themselves to by appearing on the site.</p>
<p>“The company are not doing enough to put in place the safeguards that
 prevent children exploiting the opportunity to generate money, but also
 for children to be exploited,” Mr Bailey says.</p>
<p>BBC News asked police forces about complaints they had received involving children appearing on the site.</p>
<p>One 17-year-old girl in South Wales complained to police that she was
 blackmailed into continuing to post nudes on OnlyFans, or face 
photographs from the site being shared with her family.</p>
<p>Three children also complained to police that their images had been 
uploaded to the site without consent, including a 17-year-old in Surrey 
who said her face had been edited onto someone else’s body.</p>
<p>OnlyFans says it cannot respond to these cases without being provided
 with account details, which the police were unable to pass on to us. </p>
<p>It says it has a number of systems in place to prevent children from 
accessing the site and continues to look for new ways to enhance them.</p>
<p>But there are also concerns about the welfare of vulnerable young people outside UK.</p>
<p>Missing children are increasingly being linked to OnlyFans videos, 
says the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), 
known as a global clearing house for reports of child sexual 
exploitation.</p>
<p>“In 2019 there were around a dozen children known to be missing being
 linked with content on OnlyFans,” says its vice president, Staca 
Shehan. “Last year the number of those cases nearly tripled.”</p>
<p>While much of the content on OnlyFans featuring children involves 
teenagers uploading their own content, NCMEC says it is also finding 
evidence of child sexual exploitation and trafficking.</p>
<p>In January, a couple from Florida who were in their 20s were charged 
with human trafficking after allegedly selling a topless photograph of a
 16-year-old girl on OnlyFans.</p>
<p>OnlyFans says it works with online exploitation agencies like NCMEC to raise any potential issues with the relevant authorities.</p>
<h2>‘Toxic cocktail of risks’</h2>
<p>Stories about OnlyFans have become a fixture in the press. Tabloids 
are fascinated by the fortunes made on the site, and the intrigue of 
nurses and teachers signing up.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, broadsheets have marvelled at the platform’s business model and impact on the digital landscape.</p>
<p>The Financial Times recently called it “the hottest social media 
platform in the world”. The newspaper reported that OnlyFans’ revenue 
grew by 553% in the year to November 2020, and users spent £1.7bn on the
 site.</p>
<p>Men’s lifestyle magazine GQ says “innovations like OnlyFans have 
undoubtedly changed Internet culture and, by extension, social behaviour
 forever”.</p>
<p>Andy Burrows, the NSPCC’s child protection lead, sees its impact differently. </p>
<p>He says the site blurs the lines between influencer culture and 
sexualised behaviour on social media for young people, and presents a 
“toxic cocktail of risks”.</p>
<p>“OnlyFans underlines why it’s so important that we see regulation so 
that it’s no longer a choice for platforms about whether and how they 
protect children using their services,” he says.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the UK government published a proposal to tackle the dangers posed by online content. </p>
<p>The Online Safety Bill, announced in May, would see companies fined 
£18m or 10% of their global turnover if they fail to keep children safe 
on their platforms.</p>
<p>But there are concerns about how long it will take for the law to 
come into effect and whether the deterrent is sufficient for wealthy 
tech companies. </p>
<p>The NSPCC says there is no accountability placed on senior managers, 
unlike the regulation of financial services where directors of companies
 can be criminally liable.</p>
<p>In a statement in response to our investigation, the government was highly critical of OnlyFans. </p>
<p>The website has “failed to properly protect children and this is 
completely unacceptable”, a spokesperson said. “Our new laws will make 
sure this no longer happens.”</p>
<p>We asked the department for culture, media and sport what 
specifically in the draft online safety bill would stop such underage 
use of OnlyFans and similar websites in the future.</p>
<p> It said all companies hosting user-generated content would need to 
put measures in place to prevent underage users seeing inappropriate 
content.</p>
<p>“The question is whether or not this bill will have sufficient teeth 
and power,” says John Carr, secretary of the Children’s Charities’ 
Coalition on Internet Safety. “That is still far from clear.”</p>
<p>He believes there are still no guarantees that legislation will 
require OnlyFans to do more than it currently does and says it’s “a bit 
rich” of the government to blame companies themselves.</p>
<p>“In a sense, the real culprit here is the government for not having 
acted sooner and that’s why the prospect of three, four years further 
delay is [itself] completely unacceptable,” he added.</p>
<p>OnlyFans declined our request for an interview. In a statement it said:</p>
<p>“We use a combination of state-of-the-art technology together with 
human monitoring and review to prevent children under the age of 18 from
 sharing content on OnlyFans.</p>
<p>“This is something that we take very seriously. We constantly review our systems to ensure they are as robust as possible.”</p>
<p>It added that its systems continue to evolve as new technology 
becomes available to “help us to reduce incidences of under-18-year-olds
 becoming OnlyFans users”.</p>
<p>The pandemic has transformed many people’s online lives in ways they might never have imagined.</p>
<p>But the consequences of children sharing explicit images – especially
 when the content could be leaked – may continue to haunt them for a 
long time to come.</p>
