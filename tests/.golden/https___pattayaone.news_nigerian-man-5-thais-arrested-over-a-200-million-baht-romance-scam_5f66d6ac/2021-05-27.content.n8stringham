<h1 class="rm-manual">Nigerian Man &amp; 5 Thais Arrested Over A 200 Million Baht Romance Scam</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span>by <span><a href="https://pattayaone.news/author/josh/">Josh Campbell</a></span></span><span>May 26, 2021May 27, 2021</span> </p>
<p>A Nigerian and five Thais have been detained in Bangkok following a 
police raid over a romance scam that made at least 200 million baht in a
 year.</p>
<p>A crime police search of seven locations in Bangkok, Nakhon Sawan, 
Phuket and Pathum Thani on Monday led to the arrest of the six suspects,
 Pol Maj Gen Suwat Saengnoom, chief of the Crime Suppression Division, 
said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The suspects were identified as Ms Punyawee Chusinjiraphat, 46; Mr 
Ezeneche Uzochukwu Jorome, 44, a Nigerian national; Ms Sasithorn 
Nuankaew, 22; Mr Sudjai Kamnon, 34; Mr Thotsaphol Siripru, 33, and Mr 
Nirandon Thianthavorn, 29.</p>
<p>They were charged with collusion to defraud and putting false information into the computer system, said the CSD commander.</p>
<p>Seized from them were a new Mitsubishi Pajero sport vehicle, 906,000 
baht in cash, 7 mobile phones, 18 bank account books, several sets of 
ornaments, 11 watches, 2 ivory ornaments and 11 electronic cards.</p>
<p>The arrest came after a victim filed a complaint with Pol Maj Gen 
Jirabhop Bhuridej, deputy commissioner of the Central Investigation 
Bureau (CIB) last year, saying she had been swindled out of 1 million 
baht in a romance scam</p>
<p>CSD investigators began the probe and found that the gang, comprising
 both Thais and foreign nationals, had colluded in swindling the 
complainant.</p>
<p>One member of the gang opened an Instagram account under the name Mr 
Lanny Gray. He then approached the victim, claiming to be an American 
businessman working in Malaysia.</p>
<p>After befriending the victim, the man switched to communicating 
through the Line chat app, sending numerous messages and promising to 
live in Thailand with her. After gaining her trust, he told her she 
would send parcels containing valuable items to her.</p>
<p>Another gang member, a Thai, later contacted the victim by phone, 
claiming to be an agent from a shipping firm and telling her to pay fees
 in order to receive the parcels.</p>
<p>The woman had paid almost 1 million baht but had yet to receive any packages, said Pol Maj Gen Saengnoom.</p>
<p>After receiving money from the victim, the gang also tried to swindle
 more money from her. Another gang member, claiming to be a hospital 
employee from Malaysia, had phoned her and said Mr Lanny Gray had 
suffered serious injuries in an accident and was under treatment at a 
hospital.</p>
<p>The impostor had asked her to pay almost 500,000 baht in medical 
bills for Mr Gray. The woman became suspicious and tried to contact him 
but failed. She decided not to wire the money and filed a complaint with
 the police at Wang Thong Lang police station.</p>
<p>Pol Col Wiwat Jitsophakul, superintendent of the CSD sub-division 3, 
who led the arrest, said investigators took more than five months to 
find clues about seven people involved in the scam.</p>
<p>The investigation found that the Nigerian suspect, Ezeneche Uzochukwu Jorome, and his wife Punyawee were leaders of the gang.</p>
<p>Several women had fallen victim to the gang over the past few years, said Pol Col Jitsophakul.</p>
<p>The gang had used about 50 bank accounts of other people to receive 
money transfers from victims. Once the money had been transferred, they 
used ATM cards to withdraw the money and deposited it to personal bank 
accounts, said the sub-division 3 chief.</p>
<p>Between 2020 and 2021, about 200 million baht had been in circulation
 in a bank account held by Ms Punyawee, said Pol Col Jitsophakul.</p>
<p>The Nigerian suspect had run a restaurant and a currency exchange 
shop as front businesses to conceal his wrongdoings. Police seized 
documents from those businesses for examination.</p>
<p>The CSD investigators also found that the Nigerian suspect had 
committed a similar offence in 2018 in Chiang Mai by claiming to be a 
decommissioned South African military officer to lure his victim online.
 The investigators believed several women had fallen victim to this 
gang.</p>
<p>During the questioning, the six suspects denied all charges. They 
were handed over to Wang Thong Lang police for legal action. Police were
 extending the investigation and tracking down the seventh suspect, who 
was still at large.</p>
