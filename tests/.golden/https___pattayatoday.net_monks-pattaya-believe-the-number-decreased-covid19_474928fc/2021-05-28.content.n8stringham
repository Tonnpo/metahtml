<p>Earlier this month, more than a hundred Buddhist monks gathered in a 
prayer ceremony at the Wat Chai in South Pattaya, one activity that 
received permission from relevant officials to proceed and took place 
under numerous Covid-19 precautions.</p>
<p>The grand prayer ceremony was designed to “pray away” the Covid-19 virus in the area and motivate believers.</p>
<p>According to Phra Panya Rattanaporn, who led the prayer activity, the
 ritual had brought ‘happiness’ and karma to the city and province of 
Chonburi, which has recently seen a significant reduction in the number 
of Covid-19 cases and was recently lowered from its highest level from 
Covid-19 restrictions to a lower level, allowing dining to fully open at
 local restaurants and returning many people to work.</p>
<p>However, Chonburi Public Health officials have stated that the 
decrease in the number of cases is attributed to the fact that residents
 of the province remain socially at a distance, work from home when 
possible, and as a whole cooperate in restrictions and measures such as 
avoiding crowds. and social gatherings. This is accompanied by an 
average of several thousand Covid19 tests per day, usually targeting 
‘high-risk’ locations and places such as business parks and people who 
work with the public, such as those at supermarkets or taxi drivers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pattaya police have attributed the reduction to strict 
surveillance and stopping of parties, hanging out on local beaches, and 
forcing the closure of entertainment venues and similar establishments 
where people normally gather and socialize. Pattaya City Police have 
been strict in enforcing meetings of only two people regarding drinking 
alcohol in public or organizing small ‘parties’ on local beaches, with 
multiple reports of arrests in recent weeks and nearly daily reminders 
from law enforcement that this is not the time to have social 
gatherings.</p>
<p>Pattaya plans to launch its own massive vaccination program later 
this week, with the ambitious goal of having 70% of local residents 
fully vaccinated within a few months in preparation for a planned 
reopening to vaccinated foreign tourists in October.</p>
