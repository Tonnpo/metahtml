<p class="">The <a href="https://people.com/tag/ufc/">UFC</a> is planning to restart its matches on May 9 after a string of <a href="https://people.com/tag/coronavirus/">coronavirus</a>-related cancellations, but the league will have to do so without top fighter Amanda Nunes.</p>
<p>Nunes, 31, told <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-two-division-champion-amanda-nunes-wont-fight-on-may-9-wants-full-training-camp-for-felicia-spencer/">CBS Sports</a>

<p>“I don’t think this is the right time for me right now to fight,” she
 said Monday. “Let this coronavirus pass a little bit so I can at least 
have a full camp. We can maybe see around June, let’s see what is going 
to happen. But I’m not fighting.”</p>
<p class="">Nunes is also the UFC’s women’s bantamweight champion, 
making her the first woman in the league to win titles in two different 
weight classes. She has the most wins and most title-fight wins among 
women in UFC history.</p>

<p>Though Nunes has been able to continue training amid the coronavirus,
 her home gym, American Top Team in Coconut Creek, Florida, has been 
operating under new <a href="https://people.com/tag/social-distancing/">social distancing</a> protocols.</p>
<p class="">“The gym opened just for people that has fights coming up,” said Nunes, who is <a href="https://people.com/parents/amanda-nunes-nina-ansaroff-expecting-first-child-daughter/">expecting a child</a>
 with her fianceè and fellow fighter, Nina Ansaroff. “It’s not many 
people, just me and a couple guys that are going to be on the same card 
as me. We all have separate training with just me and my coach, one on 
one.”</p>

<p class="">“I keep in shape like that,” she continued. “I go to the gym
 only one time in the morning and do everything. I do a couple of things
 by myself and some things that I need a coach. Then I come home and I 
really do everything I need to keep in shape. I have a treadmill and 
some weights.”</p>
<p class="">Spencer emphasized that while she plans to be ready for June, she will not remain on the May 9 card, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/ufc/story/_/id/29073770/amanda-nunes-title-bout-not-right-fight">ESPN</a>. UFC will pivot to a new event on May 9 that has yet to be announced.</p>
