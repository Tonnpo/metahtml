<p>The United States Government is suspicious North Korean Dictator Kim 
Jong Un potentially died or is in serious condition. Kim Jong Un had 
heart surgery last week and his health has not been in great condition 
according to reports.</p>
<p>Sciutto reported, “Breaking: The US is monitoring intelligence that 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s health is in grave danger following a 
surgery, a US official with direct knowledge tells me.”</p>

<p>Bloomberg News reporter Jennifer Jacobs reported, “NEW: Trump admin 
received information that Kim Jong Un had heart surgery last week and if
 he’s alive, his health is poor, I’m told. KJU hasn’t been seen at key 
events in recent days. It’s unclear to US officials if he’s dead or 
alive. (CNN 1st reported his condition’s grave.)”</p>

<p>Jacobs continued, “Trump administration officials are looking into 
who would be in the line of succession if Kim Jong Un dies or is already
 dead, I’m told.”</p>

<p>However, it is unclear if Kim Jong Un is dead or not. One American 
News reports he may be in stable condition but got COVID-19 from Chinese
 Doctor during Heart Surgery.</p>
<p>One American News reporter Jack Psobiec tweeted, “BREAKING: Multiple US officials tell</p>
<p> @OANN that Kim Jong Un caught COVID19 from a Chinese doctor flown in
 to help with his heart valve surgery. He appears to be in stable 
condition for now.”</p>

<p>At this moment no one knows how Kim Jong Un’s health is, but if he 
does pass away there could be an opportunity to free the entire country 
of North Korea from their giant slave state. </p>
