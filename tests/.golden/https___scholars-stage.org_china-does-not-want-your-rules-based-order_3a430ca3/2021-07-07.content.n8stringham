<p class="rm-manual"><span>Luck’s a chance, but trouble’s sure,</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>I’d face it as a wise man would,</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>And train for ill and not for good. </span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>—A.E. Housman, “<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/123/62.html">Terence This is Stupid Stuff</a>,” (1896)</span></p>
<p> <span><span>T</span>he words of Senator John McCain, chairman of the
 Senate Armed Services Committee, delivered on the 3rd of June to the 
assembled leaders and representatives of the Southeast Asian nations 
then gathered in Singapore:</span></p>
<p><span>The choice for Southeast Asia in the 21st century is not 
between the United States and China, as some would make it out to be. 
Instead it is a choice between two futures—one in which the rules-based 
order is upheld and its benefits expanded to ever more people in Asia, 
or a darker future that resembles the past in this region and the world,
 where might makes right, and bullies set the rules and break them. </span></p>
<p><span>The rules-based order has not and will not enforce itself here 
in Southeast Asia. Nor can America, despite its great power, achieve 
this feat alone. It requires its stakeholders, including the nations of 
Southeast Asia, to uphold its principles, especially when they are 
challenged. America and the world are counting on the nations of 
Southeast Asia to recommit their power and resolve to upholding this 
system on which our shared security and prosperity depend. </span></p>
<p><span>…Like Southeast Asia, China also faces a choice. No nation has 
benefited more from the rules-based order than China. In just a single 
generation, China has become an economic superpower and a major player 
in international affairs. No nation in history has risen so high, so 
fast, and in so many different dimensions. And no nation has been a 
greater advocate for China’s success than America. Let me repeat: No 
nation has done as much to contribute to what China calls its “peaceful 
rise” as the United States of America. </span></p>
<p><span>…Regrettably, in recent years, there have been disturbing signs
 that China is maneuvering toward a policy of intimidation and 
coercion—harassing fisherman from the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, 
and Malaysia; using trade as a weapon in disputes with its neighbors; 
using cyber to steal intellectual property from foreign businesses to 
benefit its own industries; conducting dangerous intercepts of military 
aircraft flying in accordance with international law; and in the South 
China Sea, shattering the commitments it made to its neighbors in the 
2002 Declaration of Conduct, as well as more recent commitments to the 
U.S. government, by conducting reclamation on disputed features and 
militarizing the South China Sea at a startling and destabilizing rate. </span></p>
<p><span>The choice for China is how it uses its growing power and 
position. China could continue to coerce and intimidate its neighbors 
and unilaterally enforce its territorial claims. It could pursue 
mercantilist economic policies. And it could engage in a zero-sum game 
for regional power and influence. China could do all of this, and it 
would harm the interests of every nation in this region, including its 
own. </span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, China could choose a better path. It could 
cooperate with its neighbors and manage disputes peacefully, consistent 
with the same international rules that have benefited China so greatly. 
It could expand free and open trade with the region and the world. And 
it could expand cooperation with other Pacific powers on regional 
security challenges, from piracy to stability on the Korean Peninsula. </span></p>
<p><span>…In short, China can choose to disrupt the rules-based order. 
Or it can choose to become a vital partner in maintaining it. I fear the
 consequences if China chooses the path of disruption. But I am 
confident that if China chooses the path of partnership and cooperation,
 China’s growing influence will be welcomed by the international 
community. And the benefits of greater security and prosperity will 
extend to more citizens of this region than ever before, China’s 
included. <span>[1]</span></span></p>
<p> <span>McCain’s words echo those <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/783891/remarks-at-us-naval-academy-commencement">spoken by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter last week to the graduating midshipman at Annapolis</a>.
 Read them both. Compare what they say. Behold the quickly crystallizing
 American narrative on China. This is a bipartisan message. It will be 
the starting point of a President Clinton’s policy. Whether a President 
Trump will endorse it is hard to say. In either case, it is a narrative 
whose momentum is building.</span></p>
<p> <span>There is much that is good in this narrative. McCain proclaims that “<span>no nation has done as much to contribute to what China calls its “peaceful rise” as the United States of America</span>.”
 He is right to do so. No nation has done more to enable China’s rise 
than America has. No country’s citizens have done more for the general 
prosperity of the Chinese people than the Americans have. This is true 
in ways that are not widely known or immediately obvious. For example, 
the role American financiers and investment banks played in creating the
 architecture of modern Chinese financial markets and corporate 
structures is little realized, despite the size and importance of their 
interventions. Behind every <a href="http://disciplinas.stoa.usp.br/pluginfile.php/106856/mod_resource/content/1/DCO0318_-_Aula_8_-_Lin_e_Milhaupt.pdf">great titan of Chinese industry</a>—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Mobile">China Mobile</a>, the world’s largest mobile phone operator, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_State_Construction_Engineering">China State Construction Engineering</a>, whose IPO was valued at $7.3 billion, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetroChina">PetroChina</a>, the most profitable company in Asia (well, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/petrochina-net-profit-plunged-nearly-70-in-2015-1458728573">before last year</a>),
 to name a few of hundreds–lies an American investment banker. I do not 
exaggerate when I say Goldman Sachs created modern China. <span>[2] </span></span><span>China has much to thank America for.</span></p>
<p> <span>However, I cannot endorse all that is included in this 
emerging narrative, for part of it is deeply flawed. The flaw may be by 
design; if the purpose is to stir cold hearts and gain moral admiration 
of others, such flaws can be excused–that is how politics works. But 
this sort of things can only be excused if those delivering the speeches
 do not take the implications of their own words seriously when it is 
time to make policy. </span></p>
<p> <span>I speak of China’s “choice.” The thread that runs through all 
of these talks is that the Chinese have yet to choose whether they aim 
for order or disruption, the existing regime or the chaos beyond it. The
 truth is that the Chinese have already chosen their path and no number 
of speeches on our part will convince them to abandon it. They do not 
want our rules based order. They have rejected it. They will continue to
 reject it unless compelled by overwhelming crisis to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Goujian_of_Yue">sleep on sticks and swallow gall</a> and accept the rules we force upon them. </span></p>
<p><span>China has made its choice. The real decision that will 
determine the contours of the 21st century will not be made in Beijing, 
but in Washington.</span></p>
<p> <span>Observers of Chinese affairs have come to recognize two 
uncomfortable truths. The first is that China is a growing power whose 
might will continue to grow in every dimension we can measure for 
decades. The second is that the Chinese system of government is a 
fundamentally illiberal one, and the system of international relations 
the leaders of this system prefer reflects their illiberalism. These two
 things are not determined in the stars; either may change, and may 
change quite suddenly. But Americans will be better served if we plan as
 if both of these truths will remain true to the end of our lives.</span></p>
<p> <span>This is not what we have been doing. For the most part 
Americans were able to accommodate themselves to the first of these 
realities by pretending that the second was not true. China could become
 more powerful, we said, because it will not be illiberal for long. 
After all, on this Earth the arc of history bends towards justice. Those
 on the <a href="http://scholars-stage.blogspot.tw/2015/06/there-is-no-right-side-of-history.html">‘wrong side’ of history do not last long</a>. How can the illiberal hope to endure? </span></p>
<p> <span>Last spring it finally sunk in. Chinese illiberalism not only 
can endure, it is enduring. The old consensus cracked apart. No new 
consensus on how to deal with China has yet formed to take its place.</span></p>
<p> <span>But old habits die hard. We see this at the highest levels of 
policy, as in the McCain speech, where American policy is justified in 
terms of giving China a chance to choose the right. The same spirit is 
invoked further down the line. Ash Carter, for example, <a href="http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2016/05/carter-its-gonna-be-long-cold-war-south-china-sea/128591/">recently described</a> American tactics in the South China Sea as a “<span>long
 campaign of firmness, and gentle but strong pushback… [until] The 
internal logic of China and its society will eventually dictate a 
change.</span>” <span>[3]</span> In other words, American policy is a holding action until<span> the Chinese</span> see the light.</span></p>
<p> <span>What if they never do?</span></p>
<p> <span><span>T</span>he Chinese believe that our international order 
is a rigged system set up by the imperial victors of the last round of 
bloodshed to perpetuate the power of its winners. They use the system, 
quite cynically, but at its base they find it and its symbols 
hypocritical, embarrassing, outrageous, and (according to the most 
strident among them), evil. In their minds it is a system of lies and 
half-truths. In some cases they have a point. Most of their actions in 
the East or South China Seas are designed to show just how large a gap 
exists between the grim realities of great power politics and soaring 
rhetoric Americans use to describe our role in the region. Murphy 
Taggart <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Japan-Shackles-Past-Everyone-Needs/dp/0199845980/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=nav_custrec_signin&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=theschssta-20&amp;linkId=7b6a357f4de5e6fdafed8cc7141ce014">describes how </a>the Chinese were able to exploit tensions over the Senkakus to manipulate the Japan and America’s relations:</span></p>
<p><span><span>Beijing saw what happened in the wake of Ozawa’s comments
 to Hillary Clinton on her February 2009 visit to Japan, not to mention 
the coincidence of the ersatz “investigation” into Ozawa’s finances that
 destroyed his chances of becoming prime minister. Chinese leaders noted
 the spasms of hysteria that shook the American foreign policy 
establishment after Ozawa led his 600-person delegation to their 
country. They understood how the Hatoyama administration had been 
deliberately sabotaged by a de facto alliance of Pentagon functionaries,
 the establishment press in Japan, and Japanese spokesmen in the United 
States committing what amounted to treason against their own government.
 And they decided to call Tokyo’s— and Washington’s— bluff. </span><span>[4]</span></span></p>
<p><span> Another example was the crisis started when <a href="http://scholars-stage.blogspot.tw/2014/05/a-few-comments-on-china-vietnam-and-oil.html">Beijing moved the oil rig HYSY981 into</a> Vietnamese waters</span><span>:</span></p>
<p><span><span>“The deployment of the CNOOC mega rig was a pre-planned 
response to President Barack Obama’s recent visit to East Asia. China 
was angered by Obama’s support for both Japan and the Philippines in 
their territorial disputes with Beijing. Therefore China manufactured 
the oil rig crisis to demonstrate to regional states that the United 
States was a “paper tiger” and there was a gap between Obama’s rhetoric 
and ability to act.” </span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>President Obama’s tour, which ended shortly before the 
whole HYSY-981 fiasco began, brought the President to Kuala Lumpur, 
Manila, Tokyo, and Seoul. One wonders if it was wise to exclude Beijing 
from this list—particularly seeing as the President’s agenda included 
signing a ten year military pact with the Philippines, declaring that 
the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands are under U.S. military protection, and 
cajoling South Korean and Malaysian government officials and corporate 
bigwigs into joining the Trans Pacific Partnership. From the Chinese 
perspective it is hard to look at this trip as anything but a hostile 
attempt to draw tight the noose and solidify a regional alliance to 
contain it. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Prompting a crisis was an adroit way to show that the PRC
 cannot be contained. Washington will not crusade against Moscow and 
Beijing at the same time. Beijing has forced the Americans to choose 
between the two. To the chagrin of our Asian allies, Washington’s 
priorities are not those proclaimed in the President’s speeches last 
month. ASEAN’s inability to stand as a united front against China’s 
actions is icing on the cake. Reports from the ASEAN negotiations have 
been more muted than the last time China was able to sow disunion in 
ASEAN’s ranks, but it is a safe guess that Chinese diplomats were able 
to pull many of the same strings they did in 2012. One suspects that 
China specifically timed the crises to display ASEAN’s disunity, showing
 the region’s middle tier powers that attempts to use ASEAN to stifle 
China’s ambitions are nothing but a pipe dream.</span> <span>[5]</span></span></p>
<p><span>A similar story can be told for numberless Chinese diplomatic and military initiatives, from <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2012/07/asean-summit-fallout-continues-on/">2012’s failed ASEAN summit</a> to the seizure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough_Shoal_standoff">Scarborough Shoal</a>.
 This is what the Chinese do. I am convinced that the Chinese are so 
adept at doing this—finding the places where one small push is all that 
is needed to display American impotence or indifference—because they are
 trained from the beginning to see the entire edifice as a lie, and thus
 are aware in a way most Americans are not of the gap between the way we
 talk about our alliance system and the way Asians experience it. </span></p>
<p><span>Wedded to this cynical vision of the current arrangements is an
 equally cynical take on the history of America’s imposed order. Beijing
 is well aware that if it decided to do to Tonga now what the United 
States did to Hawaii more than a century ago it would mean war. At the 
time the United States suffered nothing of the sort. Not that American 
wars were without their own rewards</span><span>—</span><span>the 
Americans claim island bases like Guam and Saipan as prizes won through 
conquest. China is not allowed to conquer its own prizes. It cannot 
fight wars to give its forces a new ports and bases; it is not even 
allowed build little artificial islands for the purpose.</span></p>
<p> <span>Never mind that all of that strikes the Chinese’s ire happened
 generations ago. Anything this side of the Taiping is modern history 
for the Chinese. American attempts to deny that, to claim that the world
 should work differently now than it did when the American star first 
began to rise, simply prove that morality and sweet sounding words like 
‘international norms’ are for the winners. All of that talk about being a
 responsible stakeholder is just a nicer way to say we plan on kicking 
down the ladder now that we have finished climbing up it. </span></p>
<p> <span>In simpler terms, the Chinese equate “rising within a rules 
based order” with “halting China’s rise to power.” To live by 
Washington’s rules is to live under its power, and the Chinese have been
 telling themselves for three decades now that—after two centuries of 
hardship—they will not live by the dictates of outsiders ever again.</span></p>
<p> <span><span>T</span>he Chinese will never choose our rules based 
order. That does not necessarily mean they want to dethrone America and 
throw down all that she has built. The Chinese do not have global 
ambitions. What they want is a seat at the table—and they want this seat
 to be recognized, not earned. That’s the gist of it. Beijing is not 
willing to accept an order it did not have a hand in creating. Thus all 
that G-2 talk we heard a few years back. The Chinese would love to found
 a new order balancing their honor and their interests with the 
Americans. It is a flattering idea. What they do not want is for the 
Americans to give them a list of hoops to jump through to gain entry 
into some pre-determined good-boys club. They feel like their power, 
wealth, and heritage should be more than enough to qualify for automatic
 entrance to any club.</span></p>
<p> <span>The decision then, lies not with them, but with us. An 
illiberal China is rising. No matter how nuanced our negotiation or how 
righteous our indignation, the Chinese will always feel that any attempt
 to get them to play by rules they did not have a hand in making is 1) 
morally wrong and 2) damaging to the Party’s domestic power. They are 
interested in making a new order for the 21st century. In this the 
Chinese of today are not too different from the Americans of yesteryear.
 We forget that sometimes. There was once an era where Americans were 
the ones demanding that the shape of the world change to better match 
their values and interests.</span></p>
<p> <span>The question before us then is whether we can compromise with 
the Chinese on this, and if so where those compromises can be made. What
 form that compromise might take—spheres of interest are the classical 
model here, though others exist—is still up for discussion. If this is 
our path then these discussions must be had with fierce urgency.</span></p>
<p> <span>The alternative to compromise is containment. If we decide 
that any compromise with illiberal China would poison the international 
order beyond repair then we must move swiftly to contain China before 
its power grows further still. Our aim will not only be to restrain but 
also to reduce Chinese power when and where we can. This too will 
require spirited discussion, for containment is fraught with danger. We 
must ponder long and hard how we might go about limiting Chinese power 
without making the Party’s domestic position so vulnerable that they see
 no alternative but war before them.</span></p>
<p><span>Both paths before us require careful thought and vigorous debate i</span><span>f we hope to traverse them safely</span><span>.
 These discussions are not happening. As long as we cling to the 
illusion that China has not made her choice they will not happen. The 
fruits of this foolishness are not hard to see: we do not contain yet we
 refuse to compromise, suffering the costs of both choices while reaping
 the benefits of neither.</span><span>[6]</span><span> The hope that the
 Chinese will admit their wrongs and ask to join our rules-based club is
 a mirage. It must be given up. We hold to it only because we fear the 
responsibility the truth would force upon us. The Chinese have made 
their choice. The ball is in our court now. </span></p>

<p class="rm-manual">Nice work. Certainly agree that China has made its 
choice regarding US-centric security arrangements, and will work where 
possible to undermine them. I'd like to know what you made of the 
Fontaine &amp; Rapp-Hooper piece a little while ago, breaking down the 
variation in Beijing's approach to different aspects of "the" 
rules-based order.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Couple of other points to bounce out. First, I 
agree that China has good reasons to want to demonstrate US 
unreliability, but how important is this really as the cause of the PRC 
behaviours you cite versus, say, geostrategic gains (ie control of 
maritime space), resource insecurity and its increased material 
capabilities? At Scarborough Shoal, as we know, the PRC didn't initiate 
the standoff, it was precipitated by a confluence of developments, 
including the Philippines' use of its new navy ship, and the fact that 
CMS ships happened to be nearby on a patrol nearby at the time – this 
being a function of the PHL navy having a new ship courtesy of the US 
Coastguard, and the PRC's shipbuilding projects initiated in 1999. As 
far as i'm aware, it's also not clear what level of the PRC state the 
authorization for "rescuing" the fishers was made – the CMS ships on 
patrol apparently received the distress call and asked for authorization
 before acting, but they evidently got it pretty quickly, so it seems 
plausible that it may have been authorized at the level of CMS or SOA 
headquarters and the Navy. So as a demonstration of US unreliability 
it's at most opportunistic and, as the PRC's subsequent behaviour in the
 area has suggested, motivated strongly by the desire to actually 
control the surrounding maritime space. I'm also not sure how the PRC 
could have been sure that the US would not have intervened more strongly
 – if they weren't sure, then that aspect of China's motivation may be 
better categorized as a probe, designed to test the US reaction (a line 
of thinking that i believe is important in explaining the 2090 
Impeccable incident). </p>
<p class="rm-manual">As for the HYSY-981 and island-building, they were 
both massive logistical operations with enormous financial costs and 
complex inter-bureaucratic coordination, so the resources and actual 
maritime control motivations again seem more persuasive (and in the case
 of the island building, a perceived need to "dig in" in the Spratlys, 
and perhaps make use of some excess construction capacity). If the aim 
was demonstrating US unreliability, there surely must be much cheaper 
ways of doing that?</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Also, China's reasons for to demonstrating US 
unreliability only hold up to a point, right? For example, the point at 
which Japan decides it needs its own nuclear deterrent. If the PRC were 
to actually ruin the US's credibility, the region would likely become 
very unstable, and that would clearly threaten the PRC economy – and we 
know for sure and certain that rising living standards is an agreed-upon
 strategy in Beijing (a core interest, no less). I reckon the hardheads 
in Beijing are well aware of the benefits that current arrangements have
 brought, as expressed in terms like the "period of strategic 
opportunity" for economic growth, and a "relatively peaceful external 
environment" with "opportunities greater than challenges" etc language. 
What's your take on that?</p>
<p class="rm-manual">All in all, very thought-provoking, thanks!</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> As one person commented, the Asian Infrastructure 
Investment Bank is China's attempt to create their own rules. It is also
 important to frame this discussion under the umbrella of Sinocentrism. 
The very name of the country in Chinese (and Japanese) means "middle 
kingdom", but more figuratively this refers to "the kingdom that is the 
center of everything." Since ancient times, China has viewed itself as 
the central fulcrum, with the spokes of its influence spreading outward.
 To them, people were fortunate and lucky to be located within their 
sphere. When we put this thought in the back of our minds, all of this 
maneuvering to have their voice recognized makes sense. Of course they 
feel that this recognition does not have to be earned. In their eyes, 
they've had it all along, and they want to put things back to the way 
they were (in the Asian hemisphere at least).</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Much of China's probing behavior seems designed to 
carve out the basic contours of its very own sphere without forcing the 
issue. If all goes according to plan, I suppose we in the U.S. could 
wake up one morning to a fait accompli, but that's one hell of a gamble 
on China's part.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">For quite some time now, U.S. policy has been to 
keep Russia down, China out, and Japan all to itself. That's the rules 
based order we never speak of, but make no mistake, there is a kingpin 
at the head of the table, the top slot is nontransferrable, and so go 
the rules–good, bad, or indifferent. Were it otherwise, there would be 
no succession struggle. But because the rules are so paricular, the U.S.
 can't and won't relinquish the reins.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Until such time as we accidentally stumble upon 
that "stupid proof" foreign policy you're always yammering on about, 
I'll be in my bunker wearing my tinfoil hat.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">If America does finally have the debate, it is hard
 to see any possible results apart from containment and a cold war with 
China. If, at the end of the day, Washington does believe the arc of 
history bends toward "justice" and they believe themselves to be "just" 
while Beijing does not believe the rule based order created by 
Washington to be just, it is hard to see any other possibilities. 
Russians basically have the same views (perhaps even more cynical) as 
Beijing regarding the current global rule based order and that ended 
with more or less a new cold war with Russia that is going on right now.
 Russia is a country that America does not mind offending, and the 
current result is for all to see. I don't see how China and US relations
 will end any differently as long as one side believes themselves to be 
just while the other side do not. In fact, I don't think any country 
(apart from Western European ones) really believe in the rule based 
order anyways. The Middle East certainly don't. Leftist countries in 
South America constantly complain about US imperialism. I doubt Vietnam,
 Philippines, Japan, and South Korea believe it either, they are merely 
cynically gaming it for their own purposes, just like China is. It just 
happens that China and Russia are powerful enough to make a dent in the 
current rule based order to cause enough shock. At the end of the day, 
it is hard to know if the US even believes it themselves. Does someone 
like Hillary really believe that the arc of history bends toward 
justice? From Beijing's perspective, it is hard to believe that the US 
actually believes in their own values given the hypocrisy that exists, 
and sees it as nothing more than great power politics of trying to keep 
upcoming powers down.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">The memory hole has swallowed the recollection

South China Sea. When those gentlemen met with President Obama, however,
 they unanimously refused to sign.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Everyone in SE Asia, where I live, knows this and

<p class="rm-manual">I can't see a way to limit the growth of Chinese 
power outside of a globally disruptive move that would break the PRC as a
 single entity under central control. China is still, and perhaps always
 will be, susceptible to fractioning, and that may be the only route to a
 stable reduction in the growth of Chinese power. It does not preclude 
the continuing growth of Chinese wealth (though the coastal south is 
likely to sharply diverge from the rest of China), but it ensures that 
the growth of political and military power will be stunted. It would 
shatter the global economy for quite some time, but I don't really see 
another way to stunt the growth of Chinese power. Even a drastic change 
like Japanese militarization would eventually be overwhelmed by Chinese 
militarization as long as China is to remain a single entity. </p>

<p class="rm-manual">I am pleasantly suprised at reading this article. 
Let me be perfectly clear: I am Chinese and am squarely in the PRC's 
camp. My view is that this article suprisingly capture the gist of 
Chinese view quite well, it is short on retric and long on facts. So 
kudos to the arthor for a well written article. I actually do not have 
any dispute as I agree with all your points. But I do have some futher 
comment for your consideration:</p>
<p class="rm-manual">I think most Chinese would agree that America had 
also already made it's choice – contaiment. Americian is already setting
 it up in military, political, and econmic realms; in each case I can 
easily find examples. We do make a distinction between setting up a 
containment and having a cold-war though, which explains why relations 
isn't any worse.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">I also want to confirm and definitely reassure that
 the Chinese side have absolutely zero intention in becoming America's 
underlining. The Chinese people, the nation, and the communist 
government are all too proud of themselves to accept anything other than
 at least equality in power relation. I am sure America being the proud 
country that it is think exactly the same.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The Chinese really do not feel they owe the USA 
anything. I understand American think they 'made' China, but honestly no
 one in China believe this. Chinese everywhere feel that we got to where
 we are today through hard work and self determination, both at the 
personal and the state level. In fact, those that are conservative feel 
the US had always hindered China's rise wherever it can (I am one of 
them) as long as it's not too costly. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Last but not least. I agree when you said China is 
not seeking global hegemony like the US is today. To take it a step 
further, China have no intention even in breaking the current system. I 
don't know if you would believe this or not. But if you look at it, it 
make a lot of sense. Why kill the golden goose that laid the egg? Why 
intentionally get into conflict with the US when the US is clearly more 
powerful, wouldn't that be suicidal? Why would china ever want to 
blockade South China Sea when the majority of trade going through it is 
from/to China, wouldn't that be kicking yourself in the balls? You were 
in the right direction but you didn't really reach the end in your 
article: the goal of the PRC is to make the exisitng system safe for 
China to grow within it but without bondary. No glass sealing or black 
mail from the US. This is only possible if China is treated as equal.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Anywya, there are other details I would get into, 
but it's already a long reply so I would stop here. Very interesting 
read though and I would say good job on a realisitc reading of the 
Chinese view.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Could you define the terms "rules-based" and 
"liberal" and explain how you think they characterize the American order
 since World War II and especially since the collapse of the Soviet 
Union?</p>
<p class="rm-manual">As others have said, the US manages its internal 
affairs according to a perverse legalism, but it happily breaks the 
rules whenever they are inconvenient, even the most important rules like
 "thou shalt not invade thy neighbour" (which is one of the pillars of 
the international strategy for avoiding another world war which the US 
helped to set up). The Chinese and US governments both seem committed to
 free trade, the IMF, saying polite things about GDP statistics, and so 
on. It is very serious that China is not democratic, and does not show 
obvious signs of democratization … but recent history in Turkey, the 
Arab world, and even Alberta show that politics is full of surprises as 
well as that sometimes the good guys lose.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Sovereign is he who makes the exception. The "rules
 based system" sounds fine in principle were it not for a certain actor 
who has made it a habit of being exceptional. American hegemony rests on
 the back of its acquiescent vassals. Chinese probing is designed to 
gauge and expose the limits of America's lofty rhetoric and in doing so 
undermine faith in the Imperial cult as it were. </p>

<p class="rm-manual">Been thinking about a lot about this post. Agree with your thesis that China is not making, but has already made, their choice. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Struggling to understand your response options. 
What's the difference between containment and compromise? Containment 
alludes to Kennan style cold war containment. But China has no ideology 
to contain. Or are you implying that nationalistic autocratic capitalism
 lurking behind a communistic sheen is contagious in the 21st century 
like socialism/communism was in the 20th? That is to say, it looks like 
China is merely playing very traditional great power politics. As such, 
contain/compromise are both acceptable tools for the US to use for great
 power politics. And US should be able to do that, even if not well. 
China will naturally tend toward great power empire, and perhaps that's 
what you mean by contain.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In any case, thinking about this long term, history
 suggests the problem with capitalism is without a democratic cap to 
control it, leads to crony capitalism leads to corruption leads to 
decline. Or revolution. The more China embraces markets, the more likely
 at some point they'll also feel the up and down of markets: recession, 
unemployment, etc. And without a democratic release valve, they may be 
hard pressed to control crony capitalism's tendency to stagnation. This 
threat is of course a ways off. China is one of the most dynamic places 
in the world right now. But perhaps long term then, I think US 
engagement with markets, with some minor containment is the path. 
Markets help lift out of poverty, but place a strategic lever when they 
fail towards either complete authoritarianism, or else opening up. And 
the US being engaged at that point when markets go sideways in China may
 be good for everyone.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">I agree with most of this article, China has 
already made its decision, and US should be the one decide what to do. 
And it looks like US is doing the containment thing half-assed way, they
 wish to contain China, but not willing to sacrifice its troops or its 
economy. So they do this off shore balance thing where they use its 
allies to contain China while cheer them on with words mostly, but time 
and time again, when push come to shove, China didn't back down.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">If US's goal is to force bad reputation on China, 
then I don't think China cares, because China can well demonstrate US's 
very hypocrisy in its own policy.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">But I don't agree with you is the part you said 
that US helped build China without going much detail except that US 
hoped that China would change to a liberal order.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">I don't think US did it out of altruism when they 
helped build up China, they did it, its mostly because the corporation 
wants to make a buck… simple as that. You very much underestimate the 
control of US money have over its politics. You really think Clinton 
allowed China to join the WTO because he thought China would became 
democratic? I'm pretty such the business lobby is the crucial influence,
 they see China as a huge market as well as a cheap place to produce 
things. And I think US state department have severely underestimated 
China, thinking that no real consequence will come out of this, they 
thought as China's labor became expensive, they will just became another
 Brazil of Philippines or Indonesia, where they will get stuck in the 
middle income trap, and US should not have made such mistake, because 
all they had to do is look a Korea and Japan. The difference between 
China and Japan/Korea is that Japan/Korea is still very much a modern 
day US vessel, but China on the other hand… makes its own real decisions</p>
<p class="rm-manual">So yes, China's today is by no doubt not possible 
without US and other more advanced nations, but those nations didn't do 
it because they cared about China…..</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Also one more question I have always wondered, what
 is US's end goal in promoting freedom and democracy and regime change 
in China? Would a prosperous and democratic China be less of a challenge
 to US's national interest? I don't think so, lets say the KMT won the 
Chinese civil war, I still do see they will eventually run into 
strategic rival with USSR much sooner, and once the USSR collapse, they 
would eventually compete with US on sphere of influence, resource 
control etc…. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Unless US know that most nation whom have little 
background of democratic system or a proper legal structure, when became
 democratic will be hopelessly bog down in its own corruption and 
bureaucracy, thus they would present far less challenge to US. Do you 
think if India today is at China's economic power, they wouldn't try to 
change the world order to benefit them better? And if they did try to do
 so, do you really think US would stand by?</p>
<p class="rm-manual">And lastly, you forget a 3rd option in US deciding 
what to do with China besides compromise or full containment… is that… 
even IF China is successful contained without WW3, would it be really 
worth it for US's national interest? Would a humiliated defeated 1 
billion + Chinese's new government less hostile to US?</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Would successful containment make US stronger and 
secure it another century, or would it severely weaken US/China so that 
other challenger might arise to challenge US's world order? This is the 
same question that the Byzantine/Sassanian should have asked themselves 
before they fight each other had they know the Islamic caliphate was 
going to sweep one empire away, and almost destroy the other.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">So the 3rd question is, is China too late to contain at this very moment?</p>

<p class="rm-manual">When you speak of an "illiberal China", there is a 
contrast created by the implication that the USA are "liberal" (why 
would you use that adjective if not to highlight a difference in values 
between the two players?).</p>
<p class="rm-manual">This article was written in 2016. Looking back at 
it from 2020, after episodes such as the Huawei case or the still open 
TikTok case, I find this presumption to be just adorable.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The USA have had the vestige of liberalism, but as a
 country they are equally illiberal, just in a less overt way. As a 
system, crony capitalism cannot be liberal, and we've seen ample proof 
of that.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Moreover, talking about China being "illiberal" in 
2020 sounds like the pot calling the kettle black, if coming from the 
mouth of an american, and equally laughable is the pretense that China 
calling out the international order for being based on lies is a display
 of "cynicism", when it is in fact a proof of their cleverness and 
accuracy in reading the current world order and calling it for what it 
is.</p>
