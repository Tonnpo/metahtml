<h5 class="rm-manual"><span>Did the Corona Virus Get Out of China’s 
Laboratory? Coronavirus has now spread from China to at least 40 
countries, and the number of its new patients has grown in China to the 
outside world. </span></h5>
<p><span>If the virus enters the poorer and poorer countries where health care is nominal, the death toll may rise sharply. </span></p>
<p><span>With the spread of the virus, the question now arises that it was not recovered from any bio-lab.</span></p>
<p><span>Concerns about the Coronavirus are also increasing because 
there have been people who have traveled to China and have not come in 
contact with anyone coming from China. The mattress is still unclear 
about how they got the disease.</span></p>
<p><span>Some such people are from Italy, where 400 people have been 
confirmed with the virus and 12 deaths have been confirmed. This is a 
25% increase over the last 24 hours, which has increased Europe’s 
anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span>The World Health Organization said Wednesday that the number of
 new Coronavirus patients has increased in China for the first time in 
other countries of the world. The number of patients in Italy, Iran, and
 Korea have suddenly increased significantly, which the World Health 
Organization has raised concerns.</span></p>
