<h2 class="rm-manual"> On Reading North Korean Media: The Curse of the Web </h2>
<p class="rm-manual">By <a href="https://sinonk.com/author/martinw/" rel="author">Martin Weiser</a> | October 31, 2016 | <a href="https://sinonk.com/2016/10/31/on-reading-north-korean-media-the-curse-of-the-web/#respond">No Comments</a> </p>
<p>North Korea has a conflicted relationship with media content and the internet, as Martin Weiser explains. | Image: KCNA</p>
<p>Over the last decade, a number of North Korean publications have gone
 digital, providing quick and easy access to North Korean media. This 
naturally raises questions: How do these sites operate and how reliable 
are they and the texts they publish? What might changes in official 
translations mean? How important is individual authorship of North 
Korean texts? And last but not least, how do translators and eventually 
editors shape the texts that we read?</p>
<p>Martin Weiser has written a multi-part series for Sino-NK in which he
 explores North Korean digital media and media practices in more depth. 
Based on evidence derived from more than two years spent mapping North 
Korea’s online presence, he highlights significant patterns in how North
 Korean organizations operate but also how human error and unchecked 
individual inputs can shape what we come to read. In this, the first 
part, Weiser explores how changes made to North Korean websites reveal 
both intentional editing of texts and instances of blatant, undiluted 
amateurism. — Christopher Green, Co-editor</p>
<p>On Reading North Korean Media: The Curse of the Web</p>
<p>by Martin Weiser</p>
<p>Like every other online source, North Korean websites are subject to 
change, update or simple changes in layout. Accordingly, material might 
be deleted, slightly revised, or completely rewritten. While researchers
 may wish to embark individually on the task of mapping how North Korean
 online content changes over time, three institutions save content of 
North Korean websites that can be used.</p>
<p>Three Access Routes: Changes and Deletions on Websites | First, the 
Internet Archive saves websites rather irregularly as part of the world 
wide web; it is the only service to also conserve changes made over time
 and make them accessible to the public. This makes it a strong option 
for scholars who want to save North Korean content for future citation. 
More recently, search engines have also provided access to cached 
content: For any search result, the down-pointing arrow behind the URL 
leads to the cached version of the site. Both the Internet Archive and 
this cache function have not been blocked by South Korea’s state 
monitors of the internet. Last but somehow least useful, the NKNews site
 KCNAWatch collects both text and images from several North Korean 
websites. However, for a commercial service, KCNAWatch is somewhat 
incomplete and this feature is therefore raised in a discursive 
footnote.1)<span>KCNAWatch does not cover the major website DPRK Today 
(some 10,000 articles) in full, nor smaller news sites like Ryomyong, 
Voice of Korea, or the more recent Meari Tongsin. The header “DPRK 
Today” was only added to the KCNAWatch menu recently, and some texts 
still had to be added as of late September 2016. Surprisingly, no news 
from the Korean website of Naenara is saved there. English Naenara news 
is also only accessible for 2015 and 2016, even though access to news 
dating back to 2013 is easily available through the website’s 
subsections for economy, society etc. – not to mention earlier content 
saved through the Internet Archive. While KCNAWatch claims to have 2,500
 English articles from Naenara, in the last five months alone more than 
3,100 were published in Korean on the site. A similar lack of coverage 
can be seen for Uriminzokkiri, which has been archived since 2015 – 
leaving out about 20,000 earlier articles. Presumably, this is the case 
because KCNAWatch automatically checks the general list of news articles
 published by the websites, instead of the entire website. There is no 
reason to use a simple algorithm instead of a more sophisticated 
webcrawler.</span></p>
<p>The news article lists on North Korean websites Naenara and 
Uriminzokkiri are limited to a few months, and thereby older content 
cannot be accessed through them. But like Naenara, Uriminzokkiri also 
does not simply delete older news articles. Access is still possible 
through the search function or by inputting the numerical ID in the 
article URL directly. Earlier this year, Uriminzokkiri even briefly 
removed the two-month time limit, thus granting access to articles 
dating back to its inception in 2007. This was important because earlier
 articles do not have date stamps and exact publication dates are only 
visible in article lists. After a few months a new, six-month limit was 
introduced, similar to the current five-month limit imposed by Naenara. 
KCNAWatch does not include the content from the newspapers Rodong Sinmun
 and Minju Chosun, which have been made available through Uriminzokkiri 
since 2007 (about 25,000 articles), nor KCNA reporting available there 
since 2011 (another 20,000 articles). While most KCNA texts are 
available via the Japanese KCNA website, this website does not upload 
every article published by KCNA, and Uriminzokkiri also features longer 
original versions whereas the Japanese KCNA site covers only shortened 
ones.</p>
<p>KCNAWatch also only archives general news and no other texts, such as
 biographies of the Kim family or news available on sub-sites like the 
one for the North Korean Federation for the Protection of the Disabled. 
How important this gap is becomes clear when the current size of the 
archive is considered. Of the 400,000 texts available, 260,000 come from
 the Japanese KCNA site and 100,000 from the official North Korean one 
(90% of the total), but only about 40,000 from all four sources listed 
other than KCNA — presumably not checked for duplicates and certainly 
not excluding translations. Leaving out more than 100,000 articles from 
those smaller sites is a problem as it cuts off a large (and partially 
also more diverse) part of North Korea’s online media. KCNAWatch also 
only saves webpages once, not checking regularly for changes, and no 
function is included to check for duplicates or minor changes made 
across a single text published across several platforms. Lastly, 
KCNAWatch makes several claims about North Korean media and its own 
archive which are incorrect.2)<span>Rodong Sinmun has not been providing
 English translations since 2015, as claimed by KCNAWatch (suspiciously,
 this number matches its coverage), but since 2012. Several false claims
 are also made regarding the Japanese KCNA website. One page says it has
 coverage since 1994, but it only went online in late 1996. Somewhere 
else it is then claimed that both English and Korean texts from this 
website are archived since 1997, but the Korean version is available 
only since 1998. Originally, this website was in English only. That 
KCNAWatch ignored the English content available for December 1996 can be
 considered a rather minor lapse in comparison. The claim that this 
website is searchable only through KCNAWatch also ignores the fact that 
it is searchable through any search engine which can limit results to 
only this page. As this website is based on HTML, all pages are indexed 
by search engines, different to the North Korean website which runs on a
 script language and is less accessible for automated webcrawlers. Even 
specific dates can be easily searched on the Japanese site, as its URLs 
are based on numeric dates.</span></p>
<p>Naenara, the official portal site of the DPRK government.</p>
<p>Jang Song-taek: Airbrushed from DPRK History | Although older North 
Korean online materials are available through these three providers, 
limited analysis has been done on how North Korea changes its online 
content over time. However, the most important recent case of North 
Korean tampering with its own media, the purge of Jang Song-taek, did 
receive widespread attention.</p>
<p>A total of 35,000 articles were deleted from the official website of 
KCNA following the purge in late 2013, regardless of whether Jang was 
directly mentioned in them or not. This was also the pattern for the 
website of Rodong Sinmun, underlining that this was <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/korean-central-news-agency-kcna-deletes-online-archive-news-after-execution-jang-song-thaek-1510758">a comprehensive overhaul of North Korea’s media content to eliminate references to Jang</a> as completely as possible.3)<span>However,
 neither the Japanese KCNA website nor the database Korea Press Media 
(also based in Japan) changed any of their original content at this 
time, despite apparently close links to the North Korean government. 
This is even more surprising given that the Japanese KCNA website has 
edited articles in the past – although for presumably non-political 
reasons.</span> While Jang (with several other officials) was specifically edited out of one article on Kim Jong-un,4)<span>The older version had been archived. “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140108073825/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2013/201310/news10/20131010-26ee.html">Kim Jong-un Enjoys Joint Performance Given by Moranbong Band and State Merited Chorus</a>,” KCNA, October 10, 2013, archived by the Internet Archive.</span> two articles from early November where he was only mentioned with low-level officials were simply deleted.5)<span>“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131214070935/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2013/201311/news06/20131106-25ee.html">Chairman of State Physical Culture and Sports Guidance Commission Meets Japanese Guests</a>,” KCNA, November 6, 2013, archived by the Internet Archive; and “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141012100855/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2013/201311/news06/20131106-30ee.html">DPRK, Japanese Students Play Basketball Matches</a>,” KCNA, November 6, 2013, archived by the Internet Archive.</span> Compare the following:</p>
<p>Kim Jong-un Enjoys Joint Performance Given by Moranbong Band and State Merited Chorus (KCNA, October 10, 2013, changed)</p>
<p>Among the audience were Pak Pong Ju, Choe Ryong Hae, officials of 
party and armed forces organs, chief secretaries of the WPK Provincial 
Committees, service personnel of the Korean People’s Army and students 
in the city.</p>
<p>Now look at the original:</p>
<p>Kim Jong-un Enjoys Joint Performance Given by Moranbong Band and State Merited Chorus (KCNA, October 10, 2013, original)</p>
<p>Among the audience were Pak Pong Ju, Choe Ryong Hae, Jang Song Thaek,

Kang Sok Ju, Kim Won Hong, Kim Yang Gon, Kim Yong Il, Kim Phyong Hae, 
Kwak Pom Gi, Mun Kyong Dok, Choe Pu Il, Jo Yon Jun and Thae Jong Su, 
officials of party and armed forces organs, chief secretaries of the WPK
 Provincial Committees, service personnel of the Korean People’s Army 
and students in the city.</p>
<p>While KCNA article edits might imply that the censors prefer a rather
 rough editing approach, a Rodong Sinmun article saved and (later 
re-edited) at Uriminzokkiri shows that at times they can be very 
careful. In the article, Jang’s name was dropped, as was reference to 
Pak Chun-hong (박춘홍) who was reportedly purged with Jang.6)<span>“<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/uri_foreign/download.php?ptype=great&amp;no=2337&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihv5Dy3-nOAhXHShQKHTtGCkIQFggEMAA&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6wyujpxWUzB-RUx4G29As8vZhwA">경애하는 김정은동지께서 중앙동물원을 현지지도하시였다 [Beloved Comrade Kim Jong-un Gave Field Guidance at the Central Zoo]</a>,” Rodong Sinmun, May 28, 2012. Available through Uriminzokkiri.</span>
 It resembles that which Rüdiger Frank witnessed in person during a trip
 to North Korea: the name of Pak Nam-gi, who was held responsible for 
the failure of the currency reform of November 2009, whited out from a 
newspaper article hanging on the wall of a chemical factory in 
Hamheung.7)<span>Rüdiger Frank, Nordkorea: Innenansichten eines totalen 
Staates [Internal Perspectives into a Total State] (Deutsche 
Verlags-Anstalt, 2014), 216.</span> The apparent purge of Pak Chun-hong 
was reported with the purge of Ryang Chong-song (량청송) as both were 
deleted from other articles available at Uriminzokkiri.8)<span> 北, ‘張 
세력’ 박춘홍·량청송 당 부부장 숙청한 듯 [In North, Party Department Vice-chairs Pak Chun
 Hong and Ryang Chong-song Purged], Yonhap News Online, January 17, 
2014.</span> Yonhap News stated that it came across this deletion after 
checking content pertaining to on-the-spot guidance by Kim Jong-un that 
day. Presumably, this was done by hand and not automatically. As the 
content was not checked regularly it could have happened earlier and 
even at a different times for each individual.</p>
<p>This underlines the current problem of insufficient monitoring of 
North Korean websites. It is also notable that Ryang had already 
disappeared from North Korea’s media in March 2013, whereas Pak still 
was accompanying Kim Jong-un on field guidances until early October that
 year, a month before the last mentioning of Jang in a formal position. 
Although journalists were aware of this earlier disappearance, they did 
not appear to consider it puzzling. While Ryang had been on average 
accompanying Kim Jong-un on trips once every two months before, his 
early disappearance should have raised the question of whether he was 
purged considerably earlier than Jang and Pak. If so, his purging might 
have been independent of Jang’s case or, potentially even more 
interesting, it might have been the prelude to it.</p>
<p>The Biographies of the Kims: Mixed Messages | A less well-known 
example of changes to North Korean websites are the short biographies of
 Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il on the North Korean websites Naenara and 
DPRK Today. Several changes to the text at Naenara can be traced over 
the last four years, while the texts at DPRK Today have been more stable
 and available only since late 2014. With the supreme leaders’ life 
stories purportedly sacred to North Koreans, it is surprising that the 
current texts available at the two websites are not identical. The one 
published by Naenara, for example, shows greater professionalism as it 
uses the correct names of the parties that merged into the Korean 
Workers’ Party in 1946, while DPRK Today tends to shorten official 
names. Even differing in content, currently Naenara claims Kim Il-sung 
“visited 16 countries on 106 occasions,” while DPRK Today states he 
visited 87 countries on 54 occasions – a quite blunt difference of which
 only one can possibly be true. In the same fashion, Naenara claims Kim 
Il-sung received 352 decorations from abroad, while the individual 
numbers DPRK Today gives for the different decorations only sum up to 
about 260.9)<span>“<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160723124349/http://www.naenara.com.kp/ko/great/leader.php?1+1">Short Biography of Kim Il-sung [위대한 수령 김일성동지의 략력]</a>,” Naenara, as of July 23, 2016; “<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160724100745/http://www.dprktoday.com/index.php?type=92&amp;g=1&amp;no=165">Short Biography of Kim Il-sung [위대한 수령 김일성동지의 략력</a>],” DPRK Today, as of July 24, 2016.</span>
 A closer look at archived Naenara content reveals that the site updated
 its biography at some point in 2015 with this new information, while 
DPRK Today is still using the previous one available online since 
2011.10)<span>How old the 2011 version must have been can be glimpsed 
from the biography of Kim Jong-il. In 2011 it still claimed that the 
“Selected Writings of Kim Jong-il” only had 14 volumes, yet the 14th 
volume was published in 2000 and the then 15th followed in 2005. This 
“news” was added only in an update in 2012 or 2013. But by that year the
 “Expanded Selection of Kim Jong-il’s Writing,” published since 2009, 
already had surpassed this number and his “Complete Writings” published 
right after his death did also go unmentioned. Apparently, whomever was 
responsible for this update relied on a very outdated source. As the 
biography mentions Kim Jong-il being elected to the North Korean 
parliament in September 2003, the 2011 version of his biography must 
date from around 2004. “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111219051854/http://www.naenara.com.kp/ko/great/biography.php?2">Short Biography of Kim Jong-il</a>,”
 Naenara, as of December 19, 2011. Nonetheless it still is very odd that
 it was only twenty years after the death of Kim Il-sung that Naenara 
was able to acquire the eventual number of countries he had visited. The
 older versions have been archived by the Internet Archive in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111219051836/http://www.naenara.com.kp/ko/great/biography.php?1%20">December 2011</a> and as late as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140710003216/http://naenara.com.kp/ko/great/leader.php?1+1%20">July 2014</a>.
 Next to this change, both versions show only minor differences. In 
2014, Kim Il-sung now was referred to as “Great Suryong” instead of 
president (chusok) and the editor changed “independence” (광복) of 
Japanese rule in 1945 into “liberation” (해방). The latter change might be
 more in line with North Korea’s historical narrative of liberating the 
Korean people as the Korean War also is called the “War for the 
Liberation of the Fatherland” (조국해방전쟁). That this change happened so 
late is again surprising. That DPRK Today‘s content with its outdated 
information on Kim Il-sung’s travels was not updated is even more 
surprising as it still was stylistically corrected: In the phrase “til 
the last moment of his life” the originally used Korean word for life, 
saengmyŏng, was changed to saengae, which Naenara around that time 
corrected as well. But eventually the difference in quality of both 
websites should not surprise too much as the Pyongyang Moranbong 
Publisher (평양 모란봉 편집사) responsible for DPRK Today could be expected to 
be run less professional than North Korea’s official Foreign Language 
Publishing House, which is responsible for Naenara and also all official
 translations of the leaders’ works. Recently, Naenaera appears to care 
more consistently about the biographies than during the earlier years. 
In June 2016 it was added that Kim Jong-il was made the eternal chairman
 (수반) of the party only a month earlier and the number of international 
awards he had received was raised by one. The text of the North Korean 
constitution revised in June also was uploaded there by early September.</span></p>
<p>In 2015, Naenara also deleted reference to Kim Il-sung returning to 
Korea in September 1945, but this is still included on DPRK Today. 
De-emphasizing to some degree might forego questions about where exactly
 Kim Il-sung came from and why it took him so long to return home. His 
involvement with the Russian army before 1945 is still censored in North
 Korean propaganda. Currently, North Koreans often appear unaware that 
Kim Il-sung’s mother was a Christian and Kim Il-sung attended church 
during his childhood. Simply avoiding certain information in the general
 narrative eventually can have a huge effect for propaganda purposes.</p>
<p>Regarding Kim Jong-il, Naenara provides information on his travels 
abroad, including his first trip in January 1959, which was, of course, 
to the Soviet Union accompanying Kim Il-sung. The young Kim there turned
 down an offer to study in Moscow in favor of Kim Il-sung University – 
which is not mentioned in the brief biography. North Korean propaganda 
has consistently avoided stating that the university was located in 
Moscow, with two printed English biographies only stating that he went 
to a “foreign country” or “a foreign socialist country.”11)<span>Kim 
Jong-il: Short Biography (Foreign Languages Publishing House, 2001), 
16-17; and History of Revolutionary Activities of Chairman Kim Jong-il 
(Pyongyang: Foreign Language Publishing House, 2015), 353. Both are 
available as PDFs on Naenara.</span> Instead, the focus is solely on his
 refusal to study abroad depicted as exemplary devotion to Korea. But 
everyone reading Kim’s Short Biography might already understand which 
university it was since “a large number of [the foreign students there] 
were children of heads of state.” Possibly relying on unconfirmed 
gossip, sometimes the claim is still made that the younger Kim 
accompanied his father to the Soviet Union in 1957.12)<span>“<a href="http://nk.chosun.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=9008">김정일 ‘방러’ 최장기간 외국방문 [Kim Jong-il Spent Most Time Abroad in Russia]</a>,”
 NKChosun, July 26, 2001; and Ralph Hassig and Kongdan Oh, The Hidden 
People of North Korea (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2009), 43.</span> But 
at least when it comes to the official North Korean version, this is not
 true and North Korean propaganda would have few reasons to hide such 
information.</p>
<p>Ryomyong, the website of the People’s Reconciliation Council.</p>
<p>Nefarious Nonsense: Human Error | Updates of North Korean websites 
sometimes leads to very human mistakes, as the Japanese KCNA website 
shows. By accident, four articles published on January 1, 1997, 
disappeared during a presumed reorganization of its website some years 
later, while their headlines were still included on the content page.13)<span>Both the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970504154402/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/9701/news1/01.htm#1">original page with six</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010306013706/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1997/9701/news1/01.htm">reorganized page with only two articles</a> have been archived.</span>
 As one of the articles dealt with Kim Jong-il paying respect to Kim 
Il-sung, we can be sure that this was not intentional but due to human 
error. Similarly, several other articles later published by KCNA are 
visible in the table of contents but not as full texts. In very rare 
cases it is the other way around: Without reference in the table of 
content, articles get uploaded that thereby can only be accessed by 
going through the numerical article ID in the URL. Apparently also human
 error, the Japanese website of KCNA features articles that do not 
comply with North Korea’s policy line of referring to “south Korea” and 
“north Korea” in order to stress that there is only one nation instead 
of two. At times capital and lower-case is used in the same article.14)<span>This
 inconsistency was also noted by Perrine Fruchart-Ramond, “Facts of 
Acts? Korean News Agencies Reporting on Inter-Korean Relations,” in 
Valérie Gelézeau, Koen de Ceuster, and Alain Delissen, eds., 
De-bordering Korea: Tangible and Intangible Legacies of the Sunshine 
Policy (Routledge, 2015), 152, footnote 6.</span> Sometimes the website 
even publishes news articles in all capital letters and in a few cases 
published them in a different encoding unreadable for the average 
foreign user.</p>
<p>That North Koreans occasionally do make rather grave, not to mention 
amateurish, mistakes when it comes to the internet was underlined most 
recently when a North Korean clone of Facebook accidentally went online.
 Editors of North Korean websites also sometimes make changes for which 
the logic is hard to comprehend. For example, Uriminzokkiri took down 
the journal of the Social Democratic Party in 2014, which might have 
implied a political decision. However, the website for the People’s 
Reconciliation Council, Ryomyong, features the latest editions of the 
same journal to this day. But here, links for three editions of the 
journal do not work. South Korean librarians incorrectly claim that the 
journals have not been available since the mid-2000s despite it being 
listed for sale in North Korea’s own publications catalog. Internet 
censorship by the South Korean government apparently has worked here 
very well. Why the editors of Uriminzokkiri thought it necessary to 
delete the journal at all, however, remains a mystery.</p>
<p>In Need of Surveillance: Saving for the Future | While the debate 
about saving content on the internet for future generations has been 
going on for a while globally, North Korean studies has shown little 
interest in the topic. This appears to be partially due to the 
assumption that North Korea publishes the same propaganda across all 
websites. Ignorance of the existence of sub-sites for its Social 
Democratic Party and Federation for the Disabled, which are clearly 
visible on two major North Korean websites, is quite telling.</p>
<p>Without in-depth knowledge and easy access to everything North Korea 
puts online, naturally the quality of journalism and scholarship on 
things North Korean will remain low. The material is there; we just have
 to mine it. Better monitoring of North Korean websites would likely 
yield many more examples of North Koreans updating and tampering with 
texts, programmers more accidentally than intentionally deleting 
content, and other bizarre features of the North Korean internet – not 
to mention yielding a vast range of materials to work with. A rather 
short list of websites operated by North Korea is known and, as smaller 
sites feature very little content, should be very easy to monitor for 
changes. In the future, we are, of course, likely to see a wide range of
 North Korean websites joining the global internet, allowing access to 
even more diverse content. On October 1, Naenara‘s new layout revealed a
 list of six North Korean domain “family sites” including the <a href="http://www.kfpd.org.kp/">official website for the disabled federation</a>, although none of them appear to have gone online yet.</p>
<p>Of course, the majority of people interested in such projects are 
based in South Korea and by domestic law forbidden to join in, at least 
not publicly. But there are a number of people across the globe who are 
not constrained by this, and who have an interest in documenting changes
 on North Korean websites and making them available and traceable for 
the public. The Internet Archive, which has archived content of those 
websites for almost two decades now, would be a productive starting 
point for a collaborative approach. Especially since the archiving 
process is automated and not complete for every website, only regular 
requests by individuals to save pages not covered will ensure that the 
tool can fulfill its purpose. This might, in fact, become a rather 
time-consuming procedure. But nowadays any blog can be made an archive 
and computer programs that crawl websites for texts, pictures and 
changes in code are easily written. Accordingly, the lack of such a 
database on North Korea’s internet appears to be more a problem of will 
and networking than technical obstacles and time constraints.</p>

<table> <tbody> <tr> <td><span>1.</span></td> <td><span>↑</span></td> <td>KCNAWatch
 does not cover the major website DPRK Today (some 10,000 articles) in 
full, nor smaller news sites like Ryomyong, Voice of Korea, or the more 
recent Meari Tongsin. The header “DPRK Today” was only added to the 
KCNAWatch menu recently, and some texts still had to be added as of late
 September 2016. Surprisingly, no news from the Korean website of 
Naenara is saved there. English Naenara news is also only accessible for
 2015 and 2016, even though access to news dating back to 2013 is easily
 available through the website’s subsections for economy, society etc. –
 not to mention earlier content saved through the Internet Archive. 
While KCNAWatch claims to have 2,500 English articles from Naenara, in 
the last five months alone more than 3,100 were published in Korean on 
the site. A similar lack of coverage can be seen for Uriminzokkiri, 
which has been archived since 2015 – leaving out about 20,000 earlier 
articles. Presumably, this is the case because KCNAWatch automatically 
checks the general list of news articles published by the websites, 
instead of the entire website. There is no reason to use a simple 
algorithm instead of a more sophisticated webcrawler.</td>

KCNAWatch (suspiciously, this number matches its coverage), but since 
2012. Several false claims are also made regarding the Japanese KCNA 
website. One page says it has coverage since 1994, but it only went 
online in late 1996. Somewhere else it is then claimed that both English
 and Korean texts from this website are archived since 1997, but the 
Korean version is available only since 1998. Originally, this website 
was in English only. That KCNAWatch ignored the English content 
available for December 1996 can be considered a rather minor lapse in 
comparison. The claim that this website is searchable only through 
KCNAWatch also ignores the fact that it is searchable through any search
 engine which can limit results to only this page. As this website is 
based on HTML, all pages are indexed by search engines, different to the
 North Korean website which runs on a script language and is less 
accessible for automated webcrawlers. Even specific dates can be easily 
searched on the Japanese site, as its URLs are based on numeric dates.</td>

<tr> <td><span>10.</span></td> <td><span>↑</span></td> <td>How old the 
2011 version must have been can be glimpsed from the biography of Kim 
Jong-il. In 2011 it still claimed that the “Selected Writings of Kim 
Jong-il” only had 14 volumes, yet the 14th volume was published in 2000 
and the then 15th followed in 2005. This “news” was added only in an 
update in 2012 or 2013. But by that year the “Expanded Selection of Kim 
Jong-il’s Writing,” published since 2009, already had surpassed this 
number and his “Complete Writings” published right after his death did 
also go unmentioned. Apparently, whomever was responsible for this 
update relied on a very outdated source. As the biography mentions Kim 
Jong-il being elected to the North Korean parliament in September 2003, 
the 2011 version of his biography must date from around 2004. “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111219051854/http://www.naenara.com.kp/ko/great/biography.php?2">Short Biography of Kim Jong-il</a>,”
 Naenara, as of December 19, 2011. Nonetheless it still is very odd that
 it was only twenty years after the death of Kim Il-sung that Naenara 
was able to acquire the eventual number of countries he had visited. The
 older versions have been archived by the Internet Archive in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111219051836/http://www.naenara.com.kp/ko/great/biography.php?1%20">December 2011</a> and as late as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140710003216/http://naenara.com.kp/ko/great/leader.php?1+1%20">July 2014</a>.
 Next to this change, both versions show only minor differences. In 
2014, Kim Il-sung now was referred to as “Great Suryong” instead of 
president (chusok) and the editor changed “independence” (광복) of 
Japanese rule in 1945 into “liberation” (해방). The latter change might be
 more in line with North Korea’s historical narrative of liberating the 
Korean people as the Korean War also is called the “War for the 
Liberation of the Fatherland” (조국해방전쟁). That this change happened so 
late is again surprising. That DPRK Today‘s content with its outdated 
information on Kim Il-sung’s travels was not updated is even more 
surprising as it still was stylistically corrected: In the phrase “til 
the last moment of his life” the originally used Korean word for life, 
saengmyŏng, was changed to saengae, which Naenara around that time 
corrected as well. But eventually the difference in quality of both 
websites should not surprise too much as the Pyongyang Moranbong 
Publisher (평양 모란봉 편집사) responsible for DPRK Today could be expected to 
be run less professional than North Korea’s official Foreign Language 
Publishing House, which is responsible for Naenara and also all official
 translations of the leaders’ works. Recently, Naenaera appears to care 
more consistently about the biographies than during the earlier years. 
In June 2016 it was added that Kim Jong-il was made the eternal chairman
 (수반) of the party only a month earlier and the number of international 
awards he had received was raised by one. The text of the North Korean 
constitution revised in June also was uploaded there by early September.</td>
