<h2>Episode Notes</h2>
<p>David Duke wasn’t content being a state representative. He wanted to 
go national, and in 1990 he expanded his base of white voters to try to 
attain that goal.</p>

sensation—and the message his supporters sent when they cast their 
ballots.</p>
<p>Season 4 of Slow Burn is produced by Josh Levin and Christopher 
Johnson. Mixing is done by Paul Mounsey. Slow Burn’s production 
assistant is Madeline Ducharme, and Sophie Summergrad is the podcast’s 
assistant producer.</p>

<h3 class="">About the Show</h3>
<p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a white supremacist became an 
American political phenomenon. David Duke’s rise to power and 
prominence—his election to the Louisiana Legislature, and then his 
campaigns for the U.S. Senate and the governorship—was an existential 
crisis for the state and the nation. The fourth season of Slate’s Slow 
Burn will explore how a Nazi sympathizer and former Klansman fashioned 
himself into a mainstream figure, and why some voters came to embrace 
his message. It will also examine how activists, journalists, and 
ordinary citizens confronted Duke’s candidacy, and what it took to stop 
him.</p>
<p>The season is hosted by Josh Levin, a longtime Slow Burn editor and native Louisianian.</p>
