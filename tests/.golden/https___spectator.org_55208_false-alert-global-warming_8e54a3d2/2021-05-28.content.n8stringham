<p>GLOBAL WARMING BECAME the environmentalists cause celebre in the late
 1980s. They had turned on a dime, for only a few years earlier global 
cooling had been their mantra. They didn’t know what had caused that 
earlier “cooling trend,” but its effects were sure to be bad. “The drop 
in food output could begin quite soon, perhaps only in ten years,” 
Newsweek reported in 1975. “The resulting famines could be 
catastrophic.” </p>
<p>Now warming is the specter, with its melting glaciers, inundated 
cities, and the Gulf Stream reversing course. But I doubt if the enviros
 can keep on fomenting the scare much longer. It has been based on 
little more than extrapolated temperatures and spurious charts. What are
 the facts? Surface temperature measurements show a global warming 
period from about 1910 to 1940, followed by a cooling period until 1975.
 Since then we have experienced a slight warming trend. These three 
periods add up to a surface-temperature increase of perhaps one-degree 
Fahrenheit for the entire 20th century.</p>
<p>Satellite measurements of atmospheric temperatures do not agree, 
however. They began only in 1979, and have shown no significant increase
 over the last quarter century. Balloon readings did show an abrupt, 
one-time increase in 1976-1977. Since then, those temperatures have 
stabilized.</p>
<p>Environmentalists believe that the 20th-century warming was caused by
 human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels. That produces 
carbon dioxide—one of several “greenhouse gases.” The argument is that 
their release into the atmosphere wraps the Earth in an invisible 
shroud. This makes the escape of heat into outer space slightly more 
difficult than its initial absorption from sunlight. This is the 
Greenhouse Effect. So the Earth warms up.</p>
<p>But whether man-made carbon-dioxide emissions have caused measurable 
temperature increases over the last 30 years is debated. Carbon dioxide 
is itself a benign and essential substance, incidentally. Without it, 
plants would not grow, and without plant-life animals could not live. 
Any increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes plants, trees, 
and forests to grow more abundantly. It should be a treehugger’s 
delight. </p>
<p>The surface data suggest that man-made carbon dioxide has not in fact
 increased global temperatures. From 1940 to 1975, coal-fired plants 
emitted fumes with great abandon and without restraint by Greens. Yet 
the Earth cooled slightly in that time. And if man-made global warming 
is real, atmospheric as well as surface temperatures should have 
increased steadily. But they haven’t. There was merely that one-time 
increase, possibly caused by a solar anomaly. In addition, an “urban 
heat island effect” has been identified. Build a tarmac runway near a 
weather station, and the nearby temperature readings will go up.</p>
<p>Global warming became the focus of activism at the time of the Earth 
Summit in Rio, in 1992. Bush the elder signed a climate-change treaty, 
with signatories agreeing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions below 1990 
levels. The details were worked out in Kyoto, Japan. But America was the
 principal target, everyone knew it, and Clinton didn’t submit the 
treaty to the Senate for ratification. The 1990 date had been carefully 
chosen. Emissions in Germany and the Soviet Union were still high; 
Germany had just absorbed East Germany, then still using inefficient 
coal-fired plants. After they were modernized, Germany’s emissions 
dropped, so the demand that they be reduced below 1990 levels had 
already been met and became an exercise in painless moralizing.</p>
<p>The same was true for the Soviet Union. After its collapse, in 1991, 
economic activity fell by about one-third. As for France, most of its 
electricity comes from nuclear power, which has no global-warming 
effects but has been demonized for other reasons. If the enviros were 
serious about reducing carbon dioxide they would be urging us to build 
nuclear power plants, but that is not on their agenda. They want 
windmills (whether or not they kill golden eagles).</p>
<p>Under the Kyoto Protocol, U.S. emissions would have to be cut so much
 that economic depression would have been the only certain outcome. We 
were expected to reduce energy use by about 35 percent within ten years,
 which might have meant eliminating one-third of all cars. You can see 
why the enviros fell in love with the idea. </p>
<p>Third World countries are exempt, as are China and India. Australia, 
like the U.S., has refused to ratify. Thirty-five countries, mostly in 
Europe, have agreed to reduce emissions. But there are no enforcement 
mechanisms, the potential for cheating is unlimited, and the principal 
irritation today is that the main enemy, the United States, slipped the 
noose.</p>
<p>Any unusual event is now likely to be linked to climate change. 
Within 24 hours of the tsunami in December, the CBS evening news 
displayed a graphic that had only the words “global warming” and 
“tsunamis.” Citing unnamed “climate experts,” Dan Rather intoned:</p>
<p>Climate experts warned today that tsunamis could become more common 
around the world and more dangerous. They cite a number of factors, 
including a creeping rise in sea levels believed to come from global 
warming and growing populations along coastal areas.</p>
<p>The claim that the globe is warming depends on knowing earlier 
temperatures. Such information can only be obtained indirectly. Climate 
scientists depend on tree rings, bore holes, ice cores, the skeletons of
 marine organisms. The graph that was most effective in persuading 
policy-makers became known as the hockey stick. The temperature line is 
mostly horizontal, perhaps declining slightly for 900 years, then 
abruptly heading up into a warmer range over the last 100 years. The 900
 years are the handle, the last hundred are the blade.</p>
<p>THE “HOCKEY STICK ” was first published in 1998 by the climatologist 
Michael Mann of the University of Virginia, and co-authors. It was 
immediately used by the United Nations to promote the idea that we have 
an unprecedented crisis on our hands. But the chart also aroused 
suspicions, because for years there had been a broad agreement among 
climatologists that global temperatures had not been as unvarying as the
 chart implied. There had been something called the Medieval Warm 
Period, which persisted until the “Little Ice Age” took hold in the 14th
 and 15th centuries. Both periods lasted for several hundred years.</p>
<p>The warmer period, accompanied by a flowering of prosperity, 
knowledge, and art in Europe, seems to have been wholly beneficial. 
Agricultural yields increased, marshes and swamps—today called wetlands—
 dried up, removing the breeding grounds of malaria-spreading 
mosquitoes. Infant mortality fell, the population grew. Greenland was 
settled by the Vikings, who reached a peak of prosperity in the 12th and
 13th centuries. They began declining in the late 14th century, with the
 colder weather. Then the settlements perished.</p>
<p>The warm period has been recognized in the climate textbooks for 
decades, and it was an obvious embarrassment to those claiming that the 
20th-century warming was a true anomaly. Also, the earlier changes 
occurred when fossil-fuel consumption could hardly have been the 
culprit. They would prove that warming could occur without human 
intervention. </p>
<p>Consider, in this context, the experience of David Deming with the 
University of Oklahoma’s College of Geosciences. In 1995, he published a
 paper in the journal Science, reviewing the evidence showing that bore 
hole data showed a warming of about one degree Celsius in North America 
over the last 100 to 150 years.</p>
<p>Deming continues: </p>
<p>With the publication of the article in Science, I gained significant 
credibility in the community of scientists working on climate change. 
They thought I was one of them, someone who wouldpervert science in the 
service of social and politi cal causes. So one of them let his guard 
down. A major person working in the area of climate change and global 
warming sent me an astonishing email that said, “We have to get rid of 
the Medieval Warm Period. ” </p>
<p>Whether intentionally or not, that is exactly what Mann’s “hockey stick” did. </p>
<p>Once doomsayers convince us that we are experiencing something new, 
they feel free to claim that we face a catastrophe. They can extrapolate
 from the minor and beneficial warming that we may (or may not) have 
experienced in the last generation and argue that temperatures will keep
 on rising until the ice caps melt and cities flood.</p>
<p>Then the hockey stick was challenged by a Toronto minerals consultant
 named Stephen McIntyre, who, remarkably, had no credentials as a 
climatologist. He spent two years and $5,000 of his own money trying to 
uncover Mann’s methods. Mann at first did give him some information, but
 then cut him off saying he didn’t have time to respond to “every 
frivolous note” from nonscientists. McIntyre was joined by another 
Canadian, and in 2003 they published a critical article. Mann had “used 
flawed methods that yield meaningless results. “</p>
<p>In a rebuttal, Mann revealed new information that had not appeared in
 his original paper. It had been published in the British journal 
Nature, which later published a correction. McIntyre thinks there may be
 more errors but still doesn’t know how the graph was generated. Mann 
has refused to release his secret formula. A Wall Street Journal 
reporter doggedly pursued the matter and contacted Mann. He told the 
reporter: “Giving them the algorithm would be giving in to the 
intimidation tactics that these people are engaged in.”</p>
<p>Michael Mann now concedes it is plausible that past temperature 
variations may have been larger than thought. Fred Singer, a leading 
critic of warming scares and founder of the Science and Environmental 
Policy Project, says that “the hockey stick is dead.” He was recently 
nominated by warmists to receive the First Annual Flat Earth Award for 
being “the year’s most prominent global warming denier.” Nominated along
 with him were Rush Limbaugh and Michael Crichton, the thriller writer.</p>
<p>In his recent book State of Fear, Crichton unexpectedly emerged as a 
powerful critic of modish conclusions about global warming. He studied 
the subject for a couple of years before writing his recent hook, to 
which he added an appendix comparing global-warming science to eugenics.
 Earlier, in a speech at Caltech, he had compared it to the search for 
extraterrestrials (which he says is based on bogus science). There may 
have been some warming as a part of a natural trend, Crichton allows. 
But “no one knows how much of the present trend might be natural or how 
much man-made.”</p>
<p>“Open and frank discussion” of global warming is being suppressed, he
 believes. One indication is that “so many of the outspoken critics of 
global warming are retired professors.” They can speak freely because 
they are no longer seeking grants or facing colleagues “whose grant 
applications and career advancement may be jeopardized by their 
criticisms.”</p>
<p>Environmentalists have become adept at de-legitimizing their 
opponents by saying they are “supported by industry,” but studies funded
 by environmentalist organizations are “every bit as biased,” Crichton 
added. They have become a special interest like any other, with 
legislative goals and millions spent on lobbying.</p>
<p>Myron Ebell, who works for the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)
 in Washington, D.C., one of the few groups that examines global-warming
 claims skeptically, says that environmentalism is now a $1.5 billion 
industry. In Washington, skeptics (like himself) are outnumbered by 
global warming advocates perhaps by a margin of 300 to one. Yet CEI, 
greatly underfunded by comparison with groups like the Sierra Club, 
tends to be characterized in the media as “industry supported.” The 
enviros’ problem is that they have “everything going for them except the
 facts, ” Ebell says. </p>
<p>Some environmentalists have begun to echo the complaint that they are
 a special interest. A few months ago, Michael Shellenberger and Ted 
Norhaus wrote a widely circulated 14,000-word essay called “The Death of
 Environmentalism.” It “provoked a civil war among tree huggers,” 
Nicholas D. Kristof wrote in the New York Times. In effect, it was a cry
 of anguish: Why have we been unable to win on our top issues, 
especially global warming? They called it “the world’s most serious 
ecological crisis,” which “may kill hundreds of millions of human beings
 over the next century.” They looked back to their golden age in the 
1970s–the time when they began “using science to define the problem as 
‘environmental.’ “</p>
<p>“Using science” is what they were doing, all right, and the rest of 
us were blinded by it, for about 25 years. But the problem wasn’t that 
the use of science had led them to propose unattractive “technical 
fixes,” when they should have been appealing to something larger in the 
human spirit. The problem was that their science was never very good to 
begin with. And as its inadequacies became more apparent, their scare 
tactics became more apparent, too. </p>
<p>To keep the money rolling in, environmentalists always need a crisis. It looks as though they will have to cook up a new one.</p>
