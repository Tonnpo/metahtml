<section class="rm-manual"> <span>Filed under <a href="file:///tag/research/">Privacy Research</a> on </span> 28 Sep 2020 </section><p>This is the sixth in our <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/tag/preference/" rel="noreferrer noopener">series of posts</a> about search preference menus. </p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen-winners/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q4 2020 results</a> of Google’s <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/" rel="noreferrer noopener">search preference menu auction</a> have been released and, <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/search-preference-menu-auctions/" rel="noreferrer noopener">as we predicted</a>, DuckDuckGo has been eliminated in most countries. </li>
<li>This EU antitrust remedy is only serving to further strengthen 
Google’s dominance in mobile search by boxing out alternative search 
engines that consumers want to use and, for those search engines that 
remain, taking most of their profits from the preference menu.</li>
<li>The auction model is <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/search-preference-menu-auctions/" rel="noreferrer noopener">fundamentally flawed</a> and must be replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>An Antitrust Remedy that Hurts Competition</p>
<p>As explained <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/tag/preference/">in this series</a>,
 we believe search preference menus — ones that change all search 
defaults and include the most common Google alternatives — can enable 
consumers to easily express their search preferences and significantly 
increase competition in the search market. Our most recent <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/search-preference-menu-research/" rel="noreferrer noopener">large-sample user testing</a>
 shows that when a search preference menu is designed properly, then 
Google’s search mobile market share could immediately drop by around 20%
 (with potentially greater market change shift over time).</p>
<p>However, Google’s current search preference menu in the EU is not properly designed, evidenced by the just released <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen-winners/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q4 2020 auction results</a>, listing which search engines will appear on the menu. DuckDuckGo, despite being the Google alternative that consumers <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/search-engine-preference-menu/" rel="noreferrer noopener">most want to select</a>,
 will no longer appear in most countries. As a result, many EU residents
 buying a new Android device will no longer have an easy way to adopt a 
private search engine.</p>
<p>The central problem with Google’s search preference menu is that it is a <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/search-preference-menu-auctions/">pay-to-play auction</a>
 in which only the highest bidders are on the menu. This auction format 
incentivizes bidders to bid what they can expect to profit per user 
selection. The long-term result is that the participating Google 
alternatives must give most of their preference menu profits to Google! 
Google’s auction further incentivizes search engines to be worse on 
privacy, to increase ads, and to not donate to good causes, because, if 
they do those things, then they could afford to bid higher. </p>
<p>Why Was DuckDuckGo Eliminated?</p>
<p>Despite DuckDuckGo being robustly profitable since 2014, we have been
 priced out of this auction because we choose to not maximize our 
profits by exploiting our users. In practical terms, this means our 
commitment to privacy and a cleaner search experience translates into 
less money per search. This means we must bid less relative to other, 
profit-maximizing companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/search-preference-menu-auctions/" rel="noreferrer noopener">We predicted</a>
 this outcome but chose to participate as long as we could since 
offering consumers an easy way to get simple privacy protection is more 
important than a boycott. We weren’t eliminated sooner for two reasons. 
First, prices were temporarily depressed due to less bidders because we 
believe not all eligible companies submitted the initial paperwork on 
time to participate in early rounds. Second, we didn't have adequate 
data on auction outcomes and how it impacted our business until this 
round. With this information, we bid what is long-term sustainable, and 
we were eliminated.</p>
<p>How to Make a Preference Menu that Works</p>
<p>There is a better way. Our <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/tag/preference/" rel="noreferrer noopener">series of posts</a>
 on search preference menus explains in detail how to design one that 
actually empowers consumers and increases search competition. In our 
proposal, there is no auction. Alternative search engines with the most 
market share in each market are shown on the first screen, randomly 
ordered. The remaining alternative search engines are available by 
scrolling, also randomly ordered.</p>
<p>Our research shows that such a preference menu can be a great remedy.
 The European Commission should take action now and require Google to 
overhaul its preference menu design. The current remedy is not a remedy 
at all – it is fundamentally rigged by Google to benefit Google. The 
Commission has said they have been waiting on data to act: such data is 
now available. To expedite this process, we are sending the Commission 
our data that demonstrates exactly how the current process inevitably 
eliminates DuckDuckGo.</p>
