<p>On the Evros River, the natural land border between Greece and 
Turkey, one can find the village of Marasia. Just a few metres across 
the river is Turkey. Every day and every night Greek military units and 
police try to prevent illegal migrants from crossing the border.</p>
<p>Village Council Chairman Giorgos Karabatzakis has told Sputnik that 
every night the military and police are fighting a battle for the 
border. According to him, someone from the Turkish side periodically 
shouts greetings in Greek, apparently to understand whether there is 
someone on the Greek side and whether the territory is protected:</p>
<blockquote>“Last night, when I was here too (near the river – ed. note 
Sputnik), we heard voices. Someone was shouting 'good evening' and 
'hello' in Greek to see if we had security on our side. We have always 
answered and will not stop doing so. I do not know who that was. Turkish
 border guards, refugees? We have no idea. We answer in Greek to make 
them understand that the territory is guarded”, Mr Karabatzakis says.</blockquote>
<p>According to the village mayor, thanks to the presence of the police 
and military, the flow of migrants, most of whom are “not Syrians but 
men from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Somalia”, has decreased in the last 
24 hours.</p>
<p class=""><span> © Sputnik / Fani Charisi</span></p>
<p> Giorgos Karabatzakis </p>
<p>The residents of this small village are particularly engaged in the 
struggle these days to prevent the influx of migrants into Greece:</p>
<blockquote>“The residents have prepared for everything. Most of them 
are senior people. They have stocked up on food and drink for police, 
soldiers, and border guards. The administrative building of the village 
council is open to the guys (police officers, border guards, military 
personnel – ed. note Sputnik) if any of them want to have a rest, as 
they run up and down the river (in order to track illegal migrants – ed.
 note Sputnik)”, Mr Karabatzakis concludes.</blockquote>
<p>The situation on the Greece-Turkey border in the Evros region <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/202003031078461496-greek-prime-minister-visits-turkish-greek-border-amid-migrant-crisis-video/" rel="noopener">remains extremely tense</a>.
 Turkey announced last week that it has opened its borders with the EU 
to refugees because it is unable to cope with a new wave of migrants 
from Syria on its own.</p>
<p>Thousands of illegal immigrants have since headed towards the border 
with Greece. Local police and military used tear gas, stun grenades, and
 a water cannon anti-riot vehicle to stop illegal border crossing 
attempts.</p>
<h2>“We are All Waiting for the Call”</h2>
<p>According to government sources, migrants from the Turkish side do 
not miss out on a chance to enter Greek territory. Some illegal aliens 
try to damage the fence; some go to the Greek riverbank to swim across 
the river.</p>
<p>The National Guard of Greece is part of the Hellenic Army. It is 
staffed by reservists, who permanently reside on the territory of the 
Guard units.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine-year-old National Guard soldier Vaggelis Gavranidis from 
the village of Kastanies told Sputnik that he was “fully prepared for 
mobilisation”. Vaggelis expects to be called up to help guard the Greek 
border.</p>
<blockquote>“I am part of the National Guard, as are about 50 villagers.
 We belong to the army, we have military weapons. We are summoned to the
 army by necessity and order”, he says.</blockquote>
<p>The military has so far not involved National Guard soldiers in 
patrolling and guarding the border, which is under the pressure of 
thousands of migrants from Turkish territory. “But we are all on alert 
and waiting for the call”, he says.</p>
<p><span> © Sputnik / Fani Charisi</span></p>
<p>Vangelis Gavranidis</p>
<p>The weapons at the disposal of the National Guard belong to the army 
and their combat readiness is regularly monitored by combat officers. 
Furthermore, the servicemen are often summoned to exercises organised by
 the army.</p>
<blockquote>“We take part in drills and shooting. The army has a special programme for the National Guard”, Mr Gavranidis concludes.</blockquote>
<h2>Daily Life</h2>
<p>Buses with police officers, which periodically stop at the central 
square of Orestiada, located in north-eastern Greece, no longer 
particularly impress the residents. Police officers come to take a walk 
around the city and rest for a few hours before returning to the border.</p>
<p><span> © Sputnik / Fani Charisi</span></p>
<p>Orestiada and Castanes Streets</p>
<p>Popi Petridou, a resident of Orestiada, told Sputnik that she 
continues to perform her daily routine and that she believes children 
who live abroad and read the news worry more than she does.</p>
<blockquote>“Our children are more worried than we are here. We continue with our lives as before”, Ms Petridou notes.</blockquote>
<h2>“No Job at All”</h2>
<p>The closed Greece-Turkey border is holding back not only migrants but
 also Turks who regularly visit Edirne (historically known as Adrianople
 – ed. note Sputnik). Cafes and pubs in Kastanies have menus available 
in Turkish because local establishments are regularly visited by clients
 from abroad.</p>
<blockquote>“They were right to close the entry but now, when no one 
passes by, we have no job at all because most of our clients are from 
Turkey”, an owner of a cafe on the square in the village of Kastanies 
tells Sputnik.</blockquote>
<p>On Clean Monday in Orestiada all hotels and apartments are crowded. 
Many Greeks, as usual, planned to spend the weekend in Adrianople 
(Edirne), which is about 7 kilometres from the border.</p>
<p><span> © Sputnik / Fani Charisi</span></p>
<p>Orestiada and Castanes Streets</p>
<p>In the central hotel of Orestiada, a Greek resident of Florina, who 
was there with her family on the way to Adrianople, told Sputnik that 
they were going to spend three days in Adrianople but the borders have 
been closed, so they decided to walk around here in the city.</p>
<blockquote>“Do you know what would happen here today if the borders 
were open? Lines of cars and buses with the Greeks to cross the border”,
 says Anastasia, a resident of Kastanies.</blockquote>
<p>“The Turks also visit us, go to our pubs and cafes, drink alcohol, 
because they are not allowed to do so back home – it is forbidden”, says
 Anastasia, who thinks closing the border is absolutely right.</p>
<blockquote>“Enough of these migrants”, she concludes.</blockquote>

<p>Since Turkish President Erdogan said last week Ankara would no longer
 restrain hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers from crossing into 
Europe, more than 10,000 migrants – including many from Syria, 
Afghanistan, and Pakistan – have gathered at Turkey’s land borders with 
the EU and at least 1,000 have landed on Greece’s eastern Aegean 
islands. </p>
<p>Greek authorities have responded with border closures and sent in the
 military and police to strengthen the border while issuing a halt to 
asylum requests. The rush to the border is already fuelling a crisis.</p>
