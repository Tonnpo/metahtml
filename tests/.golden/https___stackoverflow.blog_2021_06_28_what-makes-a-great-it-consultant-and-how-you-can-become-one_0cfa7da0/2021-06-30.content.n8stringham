<p>7N is an international freelance agency that has been connecting the 
best IT consultants with leading organizations around the world for more
 than 30 years. Here's the five qualities that make the perfect 
consultant.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span> <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/author/pawel-zdziech-recruitment-and-communications-manager-7n/" rel="author">Pawel Zdziech, Recruitment and Communications Manager, 7N</a> </span> </p>
<p>You know the feeling you get when someone just performs at an 
incredible level? And not just when it comes to their own tasks. They 
seem to lift the entire team.</p>
<p>This is the feeling we strive for again and again. When we find it, 
we find the perfect match. It’s tricky to predict a perfect match, but 
for 30 years that’s exactly what we’ve been doing at 7N.</p>
<p>7N is an international freelance agency that has been connecting the 
best IT consultants with leading organizations around the world for more
 than 30 years. We do this by carefully assessing our consultants and 
finding the best matches for them. You’ll read all about that below, but
 if you want to find out more about what it means to be a 7N consultant,
 you can read our short booklet <a href="https://freelance.7n.com/shared-pages/explore-freelance-life/?utm_source=stackoverflow&amp;utm_medium=blogpost&amp;utm_campaign=shared_pages&amp;utm_content=explore_freelance_life">here</a>.</p>
<p>For years, we have worked to create the perfect match – for the 
client as well as the consultant. At the core of our work is the 
understanding that technology consultants gravitate towards freelancing 
because it provides a good balance between professional ambitions and 
personal dreams.</p>
<p>To find the right match, we created an assessment framework that we 
call the 7N Competence Model. Maybe you’ll recognize parts of yourself 
in it. If not, hopefully it can help you develop your skills and 
increase your value as an IT professional. </p>
<p>We focus not only on the technical skills you might have, but also on
 your ability to recognize skills you don’t yet have or how you can best
 contribute and be a valuable team player. Many software engineers are 
hired because of their experience and technical skills, but what often 
makes them really stand out is their ability to align, interact, and 
communicate with their team. When a software engineer is able to 
communicate well with their team, it increases the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the projects significantly.</p>
<p>Our studies show that IT consultants with a wide range of 
competencies are more highly valued. This is reflected in the tasks they
 are given, and as a result, the potential rewards they might get. When 
we retain IT consultants, we work to continue growing their skills sets 
through ongoing development opportunities.</p>
<p>In this post, I will share some of my own experiences with recruiting for the perfect match between a consultant and a project. </p>
<h2>The 7N Competence Model: a five-element approach</h2>
<p>At 7N, we work with a structured five-element model, which we use to 
evaluate our IT consultants. This model has been extremely valuable in 
identifying the experts that are most likely to be successful at what 
they do. It can also help guide you to develop your skills as an IT 
professional.</p>
<p>The five elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience and business understanding</li>
<li>Skills and knowledge</li>
<li>Cognitive ability</li>
<li>Behavioral capacity</li>
<li>Personality</li>
</ul>
<p>Each element of our model has proven to be an essential element of 
the cases where we’ve found the perfect match, so let’s look at each 
element and how it can help you maximize your potential.</p>
<h2>Experience and business understanding</h2>
<p>When companies engage an expert, they are typically looking for 
someone to guide or facilitate a process they don’t have the knowledge, 
time, or desire to do. That’s where your previous experience comes in 
handy. If a company needs to migrate services to the cloud or is hoping 
to create a new mobile app, they will want a consultant who has worked 
on similar projects in the past.</p>
<p>Unless the job is focused on some very niche technologies, however, 
experience alone isn’t enough to stand out. To limit the risk of 
exceeding deadlines or project costs, clients most often hire the 
consultants who can present a proven track record in a specific field or
 technology. Be prepared to demonstrate not just that you worked with a 
certain technology, but evidence of your personal impact, of the 
project’s value to the organization, and of your ability to match or 
improve on the expected deadline and budget.</p>
<p>Business understanding often comes with experience, and this is 
crucial because no matter how skilled a developer you are, you need to 
understand the business you are working in to truly add value. Imagine 
you are trying to solve a challenging problem: if you have previously 
had a similar experience, you will likely find it easier to come up with
 a solution. When you join a project as an IT consultant, it’s critical 
to keep in mind that you’ll be solving both the technical and business 
applications, and will need to navigate both those worlds to satisfy the
 client.</p>
<p>Not all experience is equal, however. If you’ve spent ten years in an
 uninspiring environment that offered little challenge, those ten years 
might not have presented very many learning opportunities. On the other 
hand, if you constantly look to gain new insights and experience, you 
will grow over time and be able to solve many different challenges. You 
learn and grow by doing, so you should always be looking for ways to 
broaden your experience. Everything you go through presents a learning 
opportunity, and you need to make the most of these opportunities.</p>
<p>Try to reflect on what you’ve learned in any given experience. By 
deliberately thinking about what you’ve learned from previous 
experiences, you’ll be better at applying your experience to critical 
projects. You can also <a href="https://freelance.7n.com/shared-pages/meet-an-agent/?utm_source=stackoverflow&amp;utm_medium=blogpost&amp;utm_campaign=shared_pages&amp;utm_content=meet_an_agent">schedule a meeting</a> with one of our agents if you’re curious about what your experience is worth.</p>
<h2>Skills and knowledge</h2>
<p>To be a top performer, you need a high skill level and extensive 
knowledge about your field of expertise. That may seem obvious – but to 
stay at the top, you need to continuously seek new knowledge, keep 
developing your skills and refine your practices.</p>
<p>Courses and workshops are valuable tools to expand your knowledge and
 learn new skills, but once again, learning by doing is incredibly 
powerful. By working on projects that fall outside of your previous 
experience and comfort zone, you learn to adapt and figure out new ways 
to solve problems. Today, there are a wide range of open source 
projects, both large and small, that present you with an opportunity to 
practice new skills, acquire knowledge, and create a public record of 
the time and energy you have invested.</p>
<p>If you see a number of lucrative opportunities opening up in a new 
area, there are now many ways to invest in online certifications that 
will demonstrate your ability to master emerging tech trends. From 
Salesforce to AWS to RedHat, many large companies now make the skills 
and knowledge you need to work with their cloud systems available to the
 public. Browse the training section of a platform like A Cloud Guru and
 you’ll get a sense for the pipeline between existing opportunities and 
relatively accessible online training.</p>
<p>The skillset of a good consultant is not just for their own 
performance. One of the most important aspects of mastering the right 
skills is to be able to educate your peers. By evaluating the general 
skill level of your surroundings, you can multiply your impact. That 
means you add value not only through your own role but also by elevating
 the performance of everyone around you. It’s also important to have the
 ability to recognize that you are not fully equipped to deal with a 
situation because it allows you to take a step back and delegate the 
assignment to someone else or take the time to learn more yourself.</p>
<p>How can you demonstrate the ability to lift others up? Employers will
 look at metrics like GitHub stars, Stack Overflow answers, and blog 
posts or tutorials you’ve created. If they see that you help other 
developers and have a knack for explaining technical topics, they will 
have greater confidence in your ability to work with their existing 
teams.</p>
<h2>Cognitive ability</h2>
<p>Cognitive ability is a great predictor of performance, and in fact, 
the more complex a task is, the greater predictability it can offer. A 
common pitfall, however, is to confuse cognitive ability solely with IQ.
 Cognitive ability assesses your ability to solve problems as well as 
change contexts and methods while solving them. At 7N, we look at our 
consultant’s cognitive ability through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mathematical ability</li>
<li>Language ability</li>
<li>Pattern recognition ability</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that there is such a thing as an 
added bonus of being “extra smart”. The most important thing you can do 
is to know what your strengths and weaknesses are in relation to your 
cognitive ability. That way you’ll be able to navigate towards 
challenges that match your abilities and compensate for areas where you 
may not excel.</p>
<p>If you take the time to reflect on yourself, what you are good at, 
and what you are not as good at, you can become more aware of what areas
 to focus on in your professional life. We like to refer to the words of
 the Danish inventor and poet Piet Hein: “Knowing what you do not know 
is a kind of omniscience.” </p>
<p>I remember a line from a colleague of one of our consultants that 
always stuck with me. “He always takes the shortest route to the 
solution of a problem – and that is often to ask others instead of 
wasting time trying to find the solution to a problem that lies outside 
his area of expertise. He is ruthlessly honest about what he knows and 
what he needs help to solve.”</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>There is also no such thing as a good personality. There are, 
however, traits that are more suitable in specific contexts. Some people
 are more introverted, others more extroverted. Most of us fit in 
somewhere along that spectrum, and while you cannot necessarily change 
your personality, you can become more aware of what kind of person you 
are and how you fit into various work settings.</p>
<p>Not everyone has the natural ability to fit in comfortably among a 
lot of new people in an unfamiliar organization. It is, however, an 
important skill for those who want to create a smooth working 
relationship on a difficult project. It demands more than simple 
politeness and professional interest in other people – you need to be 
helpful and calm and demonstrate a certain sense of how to handle 
situations in both professional and social contexts.</p>
<p>Consultants who genuinely excel at this are the ones who, due to 
their positive and easy-going manner, often are instantly liked by 
everyone. It means you are able to talk to most people and show a 
genuine interest in them without stepping over the line. Practice 
initiating social activities in the team and make sure that everyone is 
involved and no one feels left out.</p>
<p>Naturally, no matter how sociable you are, there will always be 
places that are more suitable to some people than to others. Two 
consultants may be equally skilled or knowledgeable about a particular 
area, but one consultant would be a better fit at one organization while
 the other consultant fits in better at another company. It is important
 to find the place that is right for you, and that’s also part of what 
we try to find when looking for the perfect match.</p>
<p>Is there anything you could be doing to make it easier for other 
people to collaborate with you? Try to reflect and you’ll be better 
equipped to play an important part on a team.</p>
<h2>Behavioral capacity</h2>
<p>Behavioral capacity is the consultant’s ability to put knowledge of 
own strengths and limitations into concrete actions. We studied our most
 successful consultants for a whole year and found seven distinct traits
 that were characteristic for them all:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insight into their own strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li>Ability to perform under pressure</li>
<li>Holistic understanding of all elements of a project, including the non-technical aspects</li>
<li>Diplomatic authority, i.e. the ability to act with consideration to all involved</li>
<li>Social capacity, also known as emotional intelligence</li>
<li>Empathy</li>
<li>Grit (the level of passion, perseverance and dedication)</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, your behavioral capacity helps indicate how good you are 
at managing complex office and social settings. Do you handle stressful 
situations well? Are you able to put your own smaller project into 
context by taking a holistic view of how you fit into the wider 
framework? Do you work well with other people and know when you should 
speak up and when to listen? Empathy, for example, means understanding 
that your tasks can have an impact on other people. When you work with 
other people, you are part of a larger whole, and you need to figure out
 how to maximize your role.</p>
<p>Are you more comfortable working individually and excel under 
pressure? Look for projects that allow you to be an independent 
contributor and to focus on critical infrastructure or security. Feel 
better generating ideas with a team? Carve out a reputation as a 
consultant who can help existing engineering teams within an 
organization tackle new challenges and adopt new technologies.</p>
<p>The single most important thing you can do to improve your behavioral
 capacity is to ask for feedback. Even though many of us may think that 
we have a good idea of what other people think of us, the truth is often
 a little different. By asking for feedback from your manager, your 
colleagues, and other people you work with, you gain an understanding of
 your strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Knowing where you stand makes it a lot easier to improve. Maybe you 
are not that good at handling stressful situations? While you shouldn’t 
necessarily put yourself under immense pressure, it might be a good idea
 to expose yourself to a little more pressure than you’re used to. The 
same goes for something like public speaking. Start out by giving small 
talks to your team and then move forward from there. Maybe you’ll find 
yourself on stage in front of a crowd giving big presentations one day.</p>
<p>No matter how many years you’ve been working, you can always look to 
improve. Find new projects, join different departments, volunteer and 
look for new challenges. That’s how you grow.</p>
<p>If you really want to stand out among other IT professionals, make 
sure you have a clear purpose in your work life. What are your personal 
ambitions? Make a plan and make decisions that put you on the path 
towards your goal. And above all, have patience. Both when it comes to 
spending time on self-reflection, but also in pursuing the goal you are 
working towards.</p>
<p>Mastering these personal skills is essential to success as an IT 
consultant. We evaluate all our consultants on each of these parameters 
and have done so for more than 30 years. </p>
<p>In our pursuit of the perfect match, we try to take as much guesswork
 out of the equation as possible. Our philosophy is rooted in the belief
 that finding the right person for a task creates magic. But equally, 
that it is magical to find the right project for a person. </p>
