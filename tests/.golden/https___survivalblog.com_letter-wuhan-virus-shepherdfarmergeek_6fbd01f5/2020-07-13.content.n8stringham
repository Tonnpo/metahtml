<p class="rm-manual"> <span> <a rel="author" href="https://survivalblog.com/author/jwr/"> James Wesley Rawles </a> </span> <span> February 10, 2020 February 9, 2020 </span> </p>
<p>The following are my comments to the SurvivalBlog article <a href="https://survivalblog.com/post-exposure-prevention-pep-protocol-jj-mi/" rel="noopener">Post-Exposure Prevention (PEP) Protocol, by JJ in MI</a>.</p>
<p>This is great to be considering post-exposure treatment. Our 
protective gear is likely to be *less than perfect*, and if we know 
we’ve been exposed we need a Plan B!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5986684/" rel="noopener">This study</a> supports the use of PVP-I as an antiviral, although I do wonder about swabbing my nose with it!</p>
<p>Thinking in terms of what we can do *on the scene* when we realize 
we’ve been exposed, I’m wondering if it would be more convenient to use a
 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Betadine-Povidone-Antiseptic-Prevent-Infection/dp/B01C49IHU4/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Betadine+First+Aid+Spray+3+oz+Povidone+Iodine+Antiseptic&amp;qid=1580921901&amp;sr=8-1" rel="noopener">Betadine spray</a>,
 into our mouths (don’t spray your face or lips!), followed by a swig of
 water from a bottle, with gargling for a minute. Remember to NOT 
SWALLOW this!!!!</p>
<p>It seems to me that time is of the essence once exposed. The sooner 
we can gargle and swish the better, right? For my own family I’ve made 
up some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Care-Saline-Nasal-Spray/dp/B074F2GP3K/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=saline+nose+spray&amp;qid=1580938824&amp;s=hpc&amp;sr=1-4" rel="noopener">saline nose spray bottles</a> with two drops of <a href="http://(https//www.amazon.com/Nutribiotic-Liquid-Concentrate-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B000M7OOPS/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=Nutribiotic+Gse+Liquid+Concentrate&amp;qid=1580938909&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzQTI0RDZZWlhOUVRTJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTMzMDY3M1g3NEwzMEE0Q1pEJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0NzMyMTUxWFBBRUg3MFAyRjRFJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==" rel="noopener">Grapefruit Seed Extract</a> and about 1/8 of a teaspoon of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xlear-Nasal-Spray-Sinus-Relief/dp/B000M4W2E6?th=1" rel="noopener">Xylitol</a>.
 Supposedly the Xylitol helps wash microorganisms from your nose. I’d 
rather carry this solution in my pocket than Betadine that might ruin my
 clothes if it leaks. And I can use it immediately and discretely while 
in public.</p>
<p>As far as re-using an N95 mask goes, one of the dangers would be 
putting it back on if it really DOES have the virus on the outside. 
You’re putting it very near your eyes and would have to be *extremely* 
careful (goggles first).</p>
<p>Since the viruses don’t foul the mask like pollution or smoke or 
fallout would I don’t see why they couldn’t be re-used. But exposure to 
strong ultraviolet light might sanitize them better (sunlight, for as 
long as possible). I’m thinking that some N-95 mask – even re-used – is 
better than no N-95 mask, IF it comes to that.</p>
<p>Don’t spray the mask with liquids (diluted bleach comes to mind) or 
bake them – the mask works by having a huge network of *fuzzy fibers* to
 attract tiny particles as they make their way through. If the fuzzies 
get clumped together by being wetted (and dried) they aren’t going to 
work.</p>
<p>(The masks don’t actually block viruses – they’re too small to be 
stopped – but viruses in the air are usually embedded in tiny saliva 
droplets that are large enough to stop, although some free viruses will 
be caught by the fibers because of an <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2009/10/14/n95/" rel="noopener">electrostatic attraction</a>.)</p>
<p>There are filter masks in the pipeline with copper and silver fiber elements, but best I can tell they’re not for sale yet…</p>
<p>Here’s my two cents for supplements that help with viral infections. My family is already taking some of these:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11375434" rel="noopener">Vitamin A</a></p>
<p><a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/01/27/quercetin-benefits.aspx" rel="noopener">Quercetin</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032030/" rel="noopener">Andrographis</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/astragalus" rel="noopener">Astragalus</a> (immune stimulant)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.drweil.com/health-wellness/body-mind-spirit/colds-flu/new-weapon-against-colds/" rel="noopener">Olive Leaf</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4288282/" rel="noopener">Selenium</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.rxlist.com/n-acetyl_cysteine/supplements.htm" rel="noopener">N acetyl cysteine (NAC)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5409678/" rel="noopener">Vitamin C</a></p>
<p> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659258/</p>
<p>Guaifenesin (thins mucuous and makes bronchial cilia row faster to clear lungs better)</p>
<p>When treating a sick family member remember: this virus affects 
people’s respiration and that could require positioning them on the bed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3388640/" rel="noopener">face down</a>.</p>
<p>And, by the way, you can buy oxygen concentrators online via eBay, if you’ve got that kind of budget…</p>
<p>Last idea: Treating a sick family member at home (should professional
 medical care be overloaded) could burn through all of our N95 masks. <a href="https://www.rddusa.com/shop/nbc-gas-mask-and-protective-hood-with-double-blower-system" rel="noopener">This might be a better solution</a> (and I can tell you from personal experience it’s more comfortable!):</p>
<p>It’s a powered filter hood. I’m guessing that with a little ingenuity
 preppers could improvise a 110v household power supply to run the 
motors so you’re not going through expensive C123 batteries!</p>
<p>Thank you JJ in MI and everyone else for your ideas! God have mercy on us all.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Trust God. Be prepared. We can do both!</p>

 am not a medical professional. Do not follow my advice. Perhaps someone
 with expertise will explain more. I believe that a big family that 
lives in a city, is at risk of having a member become sick with this 
virus. I know from personal experience that an oxygen concentrator can 
keep someone alive, and give them a chance to recover, when they would 
otherwise would die. If the pneumonia gets bad enough, this could make a
 huge difference. It could be very helpful should congestive heart 
failure be possible. Don’t let it go below 90%. If oxygen saturation is 
above 90, yet the heart rate is very high, dehydration is the first 
thing to address. An oxygen tent can be easily made for children. I’ve 
done this. These are some of the things I learned from listening to Dr. 
Alton of Survival Medicine. It is a simple tool that works wonders.

 filtered hoods are used in the OR primarily in Total Joint surgeries. 
While I have never worn one personally, they appear to be comfortable, 
and are run off rechargeable batteries. I have to wonder why anyone 
would be drinking in one of these systems like the one displayed here 
though. They also are worn without mask. Usually the mask is removed by 
the circulating Nurse, after the hood is donned by the doctor and scrub 
personnel. This is only to maintain sterility and would not be necessary
 in an everyday setting. They do decrease hearing. I am glad someone is 
still working on this problem. Good Job!</p> <p class="rm-manual">Ice

to haunt us in a big way.

 ShepherdFarmerGeek, and to everyone that commented in this and the 
other article as well. On having a “Plan B”, I couldn’t agree more. If

first line of defense, then the PVP-I / PEP plan might be the blowout

to comment on the Betadine spray but I like the idea. I had considered 
adding PVP-I to saline nasal spray bottles too, although I couldn’t find
 anything on the safety of using it in that manner so I stuck with the 
plan of swabbing the nostrils instead – although I hope someone more 
knowledgeable than me might clarify that one way or the other. Paging 
Doc Cindy? I do think there’s probably lots of room for improvement in 
my plan, and thanks again to everyone for sharing ideas on how it might

 of becoming a recluse I believe most of this effort is a waste of time.
 You cannot do it 24/7 and you only need one breath of air with the 
virus to infect you. If the virus becomes pandemic you will be exposed 
to it no matter if you wear two face masks and wash your hands every 
five minutes. About the only good advice I have seen regarding this 
latest scare is stay away from cruise ships.</p> </article> <ol class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>JL</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://survivalblog.com/letter-wuhan-virus-shepherdfarmergeek/#comment-197029"> <span> February 10, 2020 at 7:13 pm </span> <span> 5 months ago </span> </a> </p> <p class="rm-manual">OneGuy,</p><p class="rm-manual">
 I must agree with you. Some prevention “tips” can be more dangerous 
than the actual disease. I will reuse a mask when cutting grass, but 
never in disease prevention. It would be removed and discarded prior to 
entering my home. Don’t reuse gloves either and I wouldn’t try to clean 
them. They come in boxes of 100 for $10, just discard them. As for your 
immune system, eat well and exercise. Some supplements contain many 
times more or less than the listed amount (they aren’t regulated). If 
you think some vitamins are good so more is better, then please educate 
yourself. Excess amounts of certain vitamins are highly dangerous. There
 are some betadine mouthwashes on the market if you choose that route. 
Obviously not a good idea if you have an allergy or a thyroid condition.
 But as OneGuy states, you’re going to have literally have to rinse, 
swish, irrigate or whatever basically every time you take a breath.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> </article> <ol class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>Once a Marine...</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://survivalblog.com/letter-wuhan-virus-shepherdfarmergeek/#comment-197150"> <span> February 11, 2020 at 4:25 am </span> <span> 5 months ago </span> </a> </p> <p class="rm-manual">One

 one breath is all it takes even if you have the Superman of immune 
systems. Tests have shown that it takes no more than a dozen virus cells
 to infect a person and you can literally inhale millions in one 
breathe. As for your immune system it does not kick in until the virus 
has infected your cells and begins to multiply and by then the numbers 
are in the billions. Your immune system responds and that is the week or
 so of felling lousy. Your immune system works but it works slowly there
 is no immediate response.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Most people who die 
from the flu die as a result of a secondary infection that the virus has
 so weakened you that you cannot fight the secondary infection. The 
secondary infection is hard to predict but one very real possibility is a
 bacterial pneumonia and you can protect yourself from that by getting 
the pneumonia vaccine.</p> </article> <ol class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>Once a Marine...</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://survivalblog.com/letter-wuhan-virus-shepherdfarmergeek/#comment-197301"> <span> February 11, 2020 at 9:46 pm </span> <span> 5 months ago </span> </a> </p> <p class="rm-manual">Yes, my medical people recommend the pneumonia vaccine, esp. for an old cat like me. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Carry on</p> </article> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>T.R.</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://survivalblog.com/letter-wuhan-virus-shepherdfarmergeek/#comment-203264"> <span> March 8, 2020 at 10:24 pm </span> <span> 4 months ago </span> </a> </p> <p class="rm-manual">One
 Guy, I think Tunnel Rabbit’s suggestion of the Oxygen Concentrator from
 Craig’s list coupled with using a plain vanilla finger pulse oximeter

sick and you can at least monitor their blood oxygen levels and then 
supplement. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Thank you TUNNEL Rabbit.

 Some real numbers coming from an actual doctor on the front lines in 
China. Please do yourself a favor and read the entire article which I 
have linked at the bottom. It’s a very readable article. Try not to cry 
when you get to the end.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Also, the mortality 
rate he mentions in the article represents the mortality rate for people
 who are very sick and in the intensive care unit, not the overall 
morality rate of people getting the virus. That mortality rate will be 
much lower. As a comparison, the mortality rate for the common flu this 
winter for Americans is 7% for those who end up in the hospital, but 
only 0.1% for the overall population getting the flu. That means the 
mortality rate for this cornoavirus looks like it is going to turn out 
to be pretty low for the general population if what this Chinese doctor 
is saying is true.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Here are some key snippets from the article (he appears to have given the interview on Feb 3rd):</p> <p class="rm-manual">“I’ve
 observed that the breakout period of the novel coronavirus tends to be 
three weeks, from the onset of symptoms to developing difficulties 
breathing. Basically going from mild to severe symptoms takes about a 
week. There are all sorts of mild symptoms: feebleness, shortness of 
breath, some people have fevers, some don’t. Based on studies of our 138
 cases, the most common symptoms in the first stage are fever (98.6 per 
cent of cases), feebleness (69.6 per cent), cough (59.4 per cent), 
muscle pains (34.8 per cent), difficulties breathing (31.2%), while less
 common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting.</p> <p class="rm-manual">“But some patients who enter the second week will suddenly get worse. At this stage, people should go to the hospital. </p> <p class="rm-manual">“For
 most, the illness is over in two weeks, whereas for those for whom the 
illness becomes severe, if they can survive three weeks, they’re good. 
Those that can’t will die in three weeks.</p> <p class="rm-manual">“Based
 on my clinical observations, this disease is highly contagious, but the
 mortality rate is low. Those that progressed into the life-threatening 
stage often occurred in the elderly already with chronic diseases.</p> <p class="rm-manual">“As
 of Jan 28, of 138 cases, 36 were in the ICU, 28 recovered, five died. 
That is to say, the mortality rate of patients with severe conditions 
was 3.6 per cent. Yesterday (Feb 3), another patient died, bringing the 
mortality rate to 4.3 per cent. Given patients in the ICU, it is likely 
to have more deaths. The mortality rate is also likely to edge up but 
not significantly.</p> <p class="rm-manual">“Those hospitalised tend to 
have severe or life-threatening conditions. Patients with slight 
symptoms are placed in quarantine at home. We have not gathered data on 
the percentage of cases that progress from slight symptoms to serious 
symptoms.</p> <p class="rm-manual">“…57 were infected while being 
hospitalised, including 17 patients already hospitalised in other 
departments; and 40 medical staff, among 138 cases (as of Jan 28). That 
demonstrates that a hospital is a high-risk zone and appropriate 
protection must be taken.”</p> <p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu" rel="nofollow">https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/reporters-notebook-life-and-death-in-a-wuhan-coronavirus-icu</a></p> </article> <ol class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>Wheatley Fisher</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://survivalblog.com/letter-wuhan-virus-shepherdfarmergeek/#comment-197032"> <span> February 10, 2020 at 7:32 pm </span> <span> 5 months ago </span> </a> </p> <p class="rm-manual">Good read.

 data, Great story, tear jerking ending. Excellent medical staff, yet 
many were sick. What happens if everyone is sick? And there is only a 
limited number of machines in the ICU. It is instructive that oxygen is 
key. Without it, the fatality rate would be much higher. This is only 
one small sample, and data set and outcomes from a fully functioning 
modern hospital. Much more is needed. As resources are expended, and 
personnel exhausted and sick, the quality of care is decreased. What 
would be the fatality rate of those who cannot access modern medicine? 
Will the virus mutate? If it is highly contagious as the doctor 
characterized, how can we expect what little modern medicine there is to
 be available during the peak of the pandemic? Already PPE is limited. 
It’s not over until it is over, and we can’t know how it will behave in 
the U.S., and how Americans deal with it. Certainly the economic 
ramifications will be significant.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> Glad I’m a 
recluse somewhere in the mountains of Montana. In past years, even a 
single trip to the store would cause me to become sick with something. I
 should have gone to the hospital at least twice last year, but could 
not afford it, so I cured myself. Since then I’ve boosted my immune 
system, but given my lousy health history, it is best to isolate myself 
as best as possible. I have a friend who can do shopping for me when he 
goes shopping for his family, if need be. But I already have enough not 
to have to shop at all for many years if need be. There are ways to 
limit exposure. I’d use them all.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Here is admission from the Chinese goobermint about their lying about the numbers:</p> <p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-02-10-china-changes-definition-of-infected-to-rig-officially-reported-coronavirus-numbers.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-02-10-china-changes-definition-of-infected-to-rig-officially-reported-coronavirus-numbers.html</a></p> <p class="rm-manual">3 videos from Mike Adams… thought provoking:</p> <p class="rm-manual">* Coronavirus Pandemic: Start thinking beyond containment</p><p class="rm-manual"> Watch this video</p><p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.brighteon.com/b056bd96-7e28-4bfd-b63a-fbba30077f75" rel="nofollow">https://www.brighteon.com/b056bd96-7e28-4bfd-b63a-fbba30077f75</a></p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">* Same media liars downplaying the Coronavirus pandemic once spread panic over the measles</p><p class="rm-manual"> Watch this video</p><p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.brighteon.com/78dc576c-c533-4112-b872-bbafaaf322d5" rel="nofollow">https://www.brighteon.com/78dc576c-c533-4112-b872-bbafaaf322d5</a></p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">* China orders citizens to murder their own pets to stop coronavirus</p><p class="rm-manual"> Watch this video</p><p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.brighteon.com/2ed50754-c128-4064-b64b-dee7a8040c48" rel="nofollow">https://www.brighteon.com/2ed50754-c128-4064-b64b-dee7a8040c48</a></p><p class="rm-manual"></p> </article> <ol class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>St. Funogas</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://survivalblog.com/letter-wuhan-virus-shepherdfarmergeek/#comment-197117"> <span> February 11, 2020 at 12:45 am </span> <span> 5 months ago </span> </a> </p> <p class="rm-manual">Hey
 Tunnel Rabbit, you and me both, glad I live so far out in the boonies 
it’ll be a cinch to self-isolate if it becomes necessary. I think I’m 
even farther out than you are, I can’t even watch YouTubes on my limited
 internet availability. 🙂 I only go to town two or three times a month 
to get the mail so if I had to skip it for three months due to an 
outbreak, no big deal. Since I’m in that most susceptible 
male-over-60-geezer group, I’m not even going to bother with PPE, I’ll 
self isolate and ping my front gate with my Henry .22 if anyone ignores 
my Keep Out sign. I’m getting one of those steel plates you talked 
about, lol.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Somebody here pointed out the other
 day that if we had as many people sick here as they do in China, 
there’d be a lot of medical people calling in sick and staging walkouts,
 and with our crazy profit-driven “health care” system, I can’t say I’d 
blame them. In China, they have a gun to their heads and no choice in 
the matter, I’m guessing, so they have to show up to work. If it gets to
 epidemic proportions here, there’s really no predicting what will 
happen because of factors like that that don’t exist in China.</p> </article> <ol class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>Tunnel Rabbit</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://survivalblog.com/letter-wuhan-virus-shepherdfarmergeek/#comment-197129"> <span> February 11, 2020 at 2:30 am </span> <span> 5 months ago </span> </a> </p> <p class="rm-manual">St Funogas,</p> <p class="rm-manual">That is exactly right, and what I’m thinking.

own self interest from medical personal down to the entry level city 
employee. Any body in the public. They have already angered the gun 
owners, and a flood of anti 2A legislation is already in the pipe. 
‘Cooperation’ will have nothing to do with what happens here. This virus
 does not even need to be as severe as the Spanish Flu to potentially 
create chaos, and mayhem in the big cities. The Chinese, although under 
the thumb of tyranny, are actually pulling off a monumental task with 
impressive efficiency and effect. With greater precision than any 
military, and on a massive scale involving at least 75 million people. 
It is truly astonishing. Our government in comparison, is totally inept,
 held in contempt on one hand, and worshiped by the drooling brain dead,
 and entitled idiots on the other. It lacks any kind of real disaster 
preparedness planning. The ideas of civil defense is complete dead. And 
even if they were to muster up any actionable plan, it would be likely 
herding feral cats. And if the threat of force is employed, gun owners 
just ain’t gonna put up with it.</p> <p class="rm-manual">By the time 
this pandemic is in the U.S really gets going, even if mild, the cheeep 
Chinese stuff that we desperately need will not be available. No more 
Wally mart stuff, no more cheap meds for the sick and dying, no tools to
 fix the machines, parts to make much of anything, then lay offs 
everywhere, prices rapidly rising, civil unrest, and more would begin 
shortly after the onset. And Trump might loose as the slobbering 
brain-deads come out big, or get sold on a socialist plan promising 
everything for nothing. Trump can dump all the infinite helicopter money
 he has, yet it will become quickly meaningless, and banks will at a 
point, refuse to do business.</p> <p class="rm-manual">This pandemic is about more than just a nasty bug.</p> </article> </li> </ol> </li> <li class="rm-manual"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> <span>Wheatley Fisher</span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://survivalblog.com/letter-wuhan-virus-shepherdfarmergeek/#comment-197126"> <span> February 11, 2020 at 2:08 am </span> <span> 5 months ago </span> </a> </p> <p class="rm-manual">My new in the bag Czech filters and masks arrived today.

 for letting me know Glad to have helped some one. It makes sense that 
these are a much more effective option than the N95 masks that now 
probably cost more than the replacement NBC filters for the M10 Czech 
mask, that I picked up for only $2.00 per pair, plus shipping. These are
 new masks. The NBC filters should be in a sealed mylar packaging, and 
be gray in color. These should look like this:</p><p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gasmaskandrespirator/images/f/f6/20170502_144243.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20170507133755" rel="nofollow">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gasmaskandrespirator/images/f/f6/20170502_144243.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20170507133755</a></p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">
 The white filter that comes in a standard bag is good for only tear 
gas, pepper spray, and other chemicals, and other smelly things. Good 
for skunk hunting too. Believe me, you’ll want a mask for rotting 
things. I would practice removing and replacing filters using this set. I
 would also prefit the mask now so it is good to go when needed. Adjust 
straps, suck air and holding hands over the inlet to create a vacuum to 
ensure the outlet valve does not leak, and the seal around the face is 
good. Adjusting straps can fix leaks around the face to mask. One size 
fits 95 % of faces. At 2 bucks per filter set, these are disposable, but
 could be used in a dust free environment for up to 8 hours. The inlet 
could be sealed off when not in use with duct tape, and the mask 
decontaminated thereafter.</p> <p class="rm-manual">It’s better to bring
 more to a fight than is the normally assumed ‘good enough’. At our age,
 good enough, ain’t good enough, and this is also, more than good 
enough, and inexpensive.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Dr. Alton recommends

 Since pneumonia is one of the complications of this virus I’m wondering
 if the Pneumovax vaccine could help. (Yes, I have issues with the flu 
vax, but some vaccines work and are very helpful.)</p> <p class="rm-manual">2.
 Gargling and swabbing our noses with Betadine/Povidone-Iodine is only 
going to disinfect a small percentage of inhaled viruses that will have 
proceeded directly to our lungs. And unless we can gargle and swab 
immediately after inhalation the flow of mucus in our upper respiratory 
system will wash the viruses into our throats where we can’t reach them 
with gargling and swabbing. That said, desperate people do desperate 
things. Don’t be that person.</p> <p class="rm-manual">3. <a href="https://whatkillsit.com/virus/what-kills-coronavirus/" rel="nofollow">https://whatkillsit.com/virus/what-kills-coronavirus/</a>
 This person went to a LOT of trouble to document which disinfectants

get an effective product!</p> <p class="rm-manual">4. It’s probably not 
accurate to say that our immune system is inert until an infection 
reaches a certain threshold. But it does take it a while to spin up 
after it recognizes an invader. All we can do is be sure our immune 
systems have the raw materials to respond properly – good nutrition and 
supplementation that is clinically proven to assist. That and minimize 
our exposure the best we can.</p> <p class="rm-manual">5. <a href="https://survivalblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Wheel-of-Doom.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://survivalblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Wheel-of-Doom.jpg</a>
 This sure seems to me like The Real Deal. And like all of these 
potential crises that we’ve been preparing for (for decades, some of 
us), we must not surrender to panic or despair. Do what you know to do.
