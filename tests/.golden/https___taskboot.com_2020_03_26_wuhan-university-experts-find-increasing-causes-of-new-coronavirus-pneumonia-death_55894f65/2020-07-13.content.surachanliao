<h1 class="">Wuhan University Experts Find Increasing Causes of New coronavirus Pneumonia Death</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><span> <span> 4 months ago </span> </span></p>
<p>According to foreign media reports, a study published online in the 
Journal of the American Medical Association March 25. The study reported
 that heart failure was associated with the hospitalization of new 
coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). Is due to an increase in mortality.</p>
<p>In the study, researchers at People’s Hospital of Wuhan University in
 China conducted a joint study from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 
2020. He investigating the relationship between heart disease and 
mortality. They analyzed 416 COVID-19 hospitalized patients. ۔</p>
<p>Researchers found that common symptoms in these patients include 
fever, cough, and shortness of breath (80.3%, 34.6%, and 28.1%, 
respectively). Of these, 82 patients had a heart attack. These patients 
were older. He had more companionship and had higher white blood cell 
count than non-heart attack patients.</p>
<p>In studies, traumatic events and ground glass shadows (64.6% and 
4.5%)) are higher for heart injury patients than for patients without 
heart injury. Patients with heart injury require a higher proportion of 
Nine Wosk mechanical ventilation (3.9% and 46.3%). The proportion of 
invasive mechanical ventilation was even higher (4.2% and 22%); more 
likely to have complications and fatalities. Are high (51.2% and 4.5%).</p>
<p>The researchers said that while the exact mechanism by which COVID-19
 increases mortality from heart injury needs further research. The study
 highlights the need to consider this complexity in the treatment of 
COVID-19.</p>

<h2><span>Oxford study says half of the UK population has been infected with the new coronavirus</span></h2>
<p>Recently, according to media reports, a new pneumonia pandemic study,
 led by Oxford University’s Professor Sunetella Gupta. He revealed that 
the new coronavirus may have affected half the population of the UK</p>
<p><a href="https://taskboot.com/2020/04/29/new-coronavirus-in-the-united-states-exceeded-1-million/" rel="nofollow"></a></p><p><a href="https://taskboot.com/2020/04/29/new-coronavirus-in-the-united-states-exceeded-1-million/" rel="nofollow"><span>READ ALSO: </span> <span>New coronavirus in the United States exceeded 1 million</span></a></p><p></p>
<p>This study is based on the “susceptible-sensitive model” (SR model) 
of pneumonia coronavirus pneumonia to analyze confirmed and fatal events
 in the UK and Italy. The model said the new Coronavirus appeared in the
 UK only after the middle of January. The first confirmed case in the UK
 was recorded a month later, namely in late February.</p>
<p>Through a model analysis, researchers found that when the first death
 occurred in Britain on March 5, thousands of people were infected with 
the new coronavirus. When the number of primary infections of the virus 
is R0 = 2.25 (the average number of ROs infected) and R0 = 2.75, by 
March 19, approximately 36% and 40% of the population has encountered 
new coronaviruses, respectively.</p>
<p>Using the same model with R0 = 2.25, the time when the virus began to
 spread was confirmed 4 days before the case was confirmed and 38 days 
before the death. By March 19, 68% of British people have been infected 
with the new crown virus.</p>
<p>Using the same model, the time when the virus began to spread in 
Italy was fixed 10 days before the first case was confirmed and 1 month 
before the first death was confirmed. It has been shown that by March 6,
 45 days after the virus was detected, approximately 60% (R0 = 2.25) and
 64 (R0 = 2.75) of Italy had revealed new crown viruses.</p>
<p>When the proportion of high-risk groups is about 0.1%. The virus is 
likely to spread 17 days before the first confirmed case and 38 days 
before the first death, and about 80 percent of Italy will be infected 
by March 6. ۔</p>

These two drugs can inhibit the coronavirus</span></a></p><p></p>
<p>Professor Sonila Gupta said that if this result is confirmed, it 
means that less than one in 1,000 people with the new coronavirus are 
ill, and most people have only mild symptoms or no symptoms. do not 
have. Therefore, he believes that large-scale antibody tests need to be 
started immediately to confirm whether or not the body has produced 
antibodies.</p>
<p>If the results of this study are confirmed, it means that for more 
than two months, the country has achieved significant immunity to flocks
 through the silent transfer of new coronary pneumonia to the UK. To 
provide the necessary evidence, the research team at the University of 
Oxford is currently working closely with research teams at the 
University of Cambridge and Kent to launch antibody testing for the 
entire population as soon as possible<a href="https://www.twitter.com/">.</a></p>
