<h1 class="rm-manual">IBM, Amazon, Google and Microsoft partner with White House to provide compute resources for COVID-19 research</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/"> Frederic Lardinois </a> <span> <a href="https://twitter.com/fredericl">@fredericl</a> <span> / </span> 3 months </span> </p>
<p>During today’s White House coronavirus task force press conference, 
President Trump announced the launch of a new public/private consortium 
to “unleash the power of American supercomputing resources.” The members
 of this consortium are the White House, the Department of Energy and <a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ibm">IBM </a>.
 Other companies, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as a 
number of academic institutions, are also “contributing lots of 
different things,” the president said.</p>
<p>While Trump’s comments were characteristically unclear, IBM <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-helps-bring-supercomputers-into-the-global-fight-against-COVID-19">provided more details</a>,
 noting that it is working with a number of national labs and other 
institutions to offer a total of 330 petaflops of compute to various 
projects in epidemiology, bioinformatics and molecular modeling. Amazon,
 Google and Microsoft are also part of the consortium, which is being 
led by IBM, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and
 the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>IBM and its partners will coordinate the efforts to evaluate 
proposals and provide access to high-performance computing resources to 
those that are most likely to have an immediate impact.</p>
<p>“How can supercomputers help us fight this virus? These 
high-performance computing systems allow researchers to run very large 
numbers of calculations in epidemiology, bioinformatics, and molecular 
modeling. These experiments would take years to complete if worked by 
hand, or months if handled on slower, traditional computing platforms,” 
writes Dario Gil, IBM’s Director of Research.</p>
<p>AWS has already <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/innovation/aws-launches-initiative-to-accelerate-covid-19-diagnostics-research-and-testing?utm_source=social&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw&amp;amp;utm_term=amznnews&amp;amp;utm_content=COVID-19_AWSResearch">dedicated</a>
 $20 million to support COVID-19 research while Microsoft has already 
announced a number of different initiatives, though mostly around 
helping businesses cope with the fallout of this crisis. Google has now 
launched its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/21/google-launches-covid-19-page-and-search-portal-with-safety-tips-official-stats-and-more-us-only-for-now/">coronavirus website</a>
 (though it’s very different from the one Trump once promised) and 
Alphabet’s Verily is helping Bay Area residents find testing sites if 
needed.</p>
<p>After today’s announcement, the White House shared statements from <a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft">Microsoft, </a>
 Google and other partners. “We know that high performance computing can
 reduce the time it takes to process massive data sets and perform 
complex simulations from days to hours,” said Mike Daniels, Vice 
President, Global Public Sector at <a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google">Google </a>
 Cloud, in his statement. “We look forward to participating in this 
initiative alongside leaders in technology, academia and the public 
sector to make more resources available to COVID-19 researchers and to 
apply Google Cloud computing capabilities toward the development of 
potential treatments and vaccines.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Microsoft’s global head for its AI for Health Program, 
John Kahan, notes that Microsoft wants to “make sure researchers working
 to combat COVID-19 have access to the tools they need” by expanding 
access to its Azure cloud and by creating more opportunities for 
researchers to collaborate with the company’s data scientists.</p>
<p>“Today I’m also announcing the launch of a new public/private 
consortium organized by the White House, the Department of Energy and 
IBM to unleash the power of American supercomputing resources to fight 
the Chinese virus,” Trump, who continues to insist on calling COVID-19 
‘the Chinese virus,’ said in today’s press briefing.</p>
<p>“The following leaders from private industries, academia and 
government will be contributing and they are gonna be contributing a lot
 of different things, but compute primarily — computing resources to 
help researchers discover new treatments and vaccine. They will be 
working along with NIH and all of the people working on this. But 
tremendous help from IBM, Google, <a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon">Amazon, </a> Microsoft, MIT, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Department of Energy’s, the <a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/national-science-foundation">National Science Foundation </a> and NASA. They are all contributing to this effort.”</p>
