<h1 class="rm-manual">Frontiers launches a portal to help connect coronavirus and COVID-19 research with funding</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/darrell-etherington/"> Darrell Etherington </a> <span> <a href="https://twitter.com/etherington">@etherington</a> <span> / </span> 4 months </span> </p>
<p>Open science platform and publisher Frontiers wants to make sure that
 efforts by researchers to pursue science-based solutions to the global 
coronavirus pandemic, and learn more about the virus and the COVID-19 
disease it causes, find the funding they need. They launched a <a href="https://coronavirus.frontiersin.org/covid-19-research-funding-monitor">new portal to do just that</a>,
 which is updated daily, and lists open funding calls, including the 
grant type, deadline, organization behind it, and specific area it 
supports.</p>
<p>Sources include governments, non-profits, and commercial companies, 
and the listings link directly to the calls for easy application. This 
dashboard presents one fo the best organized ways for anyone with a 
research project related to COVID-19 to find an appropriate funding 
source, with all relevant top-line information presented up front.</p>
<p>For anyone looking to supplement their existing knowledge of ongoing 
coronavirus and COVID-19 research, Frontiers is also offering a portal 
called the <a href="https://coronavirus.frontiersin.org/">‘Coronavirus Knowledge Hub,’</a> which includes links to the top research on SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 symptoms, treatments, transmission and much more.</p>
<p>It’s crucial right now that research not go unfunded, since there’s a
 global urgency around the investigation into, and development of, 
potential solutions and treatments around COVID-19. There’s still a lot 
we just don’t know about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, even leaving aside the
 many potential treatments under development – basic research about its 
genetic makeup, mutation patterns and durability are still pictures we 
need filled in to develop lasting and effective methods of prevention 
and protection.</p>
<p>A resource like this, which connects the dots between this work and 
available sources of funding, is incredibly valuable. Potential funders 
should get in touch with Frontiers via their submission form if they 
have a way to get much-needed resources to scientists working on this 
problem.</p></article>
