<h1 class="rm-manual">Leading VCs discuss how COVID-19 is impacting real estate &amp; proptech</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/arman-tabatabai/"> Arman Tabatabai </a> <span> 4 months </span> </p>
<p><span>Several months ago</span>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-real-estate-and-proptech-part-1-of-2/">we surveyed more than 20 leading real estate VCs</a>
 to learn about what was exciting them most in the real estate tech 
sector and hear their opinions on proptech trends like co-working, 
flexible office space and remote office space.</p>
<p>Since we published our survey, COVID-19 has flipped the real estate 
sector on its head as more companies move toward mandatory remote work, 
retail businesses are forced to temporarily shut their doors and 
high-traffic properties thin out. Suddenly, the traditionally 
predictable world of real estate is more chaotic and unclear than ever.</p>
<p>What are the short and long-term impacts of pandemic-induced 
volatility? Does this open up opportunities for proptech startups or 
shutter them? What does this mean from an investing point of view? We 
asked several of the VCs that participated in our last survey to update 
us on how COVID-19 is impacting real estate startups, non-proptech 
companies in general and the broader real estate market overall:</p>

be immune to the pressures venture-backed companies face in a market 
pullback, and we are preparing ourselves and our portfolio companies for
 a bumpy year.</p></article>
