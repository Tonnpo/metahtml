<h1 class="rm-manual">Britney Spears Deemed 'Not Okay', Chili Dog Video Sparks Control Fears That She 'Can't Talk'</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><span> Britney Spears/Instagram </span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Jul 9, 2020 at 0:32 am UTC <a href="file:///author/345"> By <span>Rebecca Cukier</span></a></p>
<p class=""><a href="https://theblast.com/tag/britney-spears" rel="noopener">Britney Spears</a>
 has sparked fears that she is "not allowed" to speak freely. The 
38-year-old pop princess just went Q&amp;A in an Instagram video 
answering fan questions ranging from her favorite food to her top travel
 destination – while Britney got the thumbs-up for admitting that the 
humble <a href="file:///c/britney-spears-freebritney-answers-fans-questions-favorite-food-chili-dog-song-toxic-vacation-spots">chili dog tops her food list</a>, her 24.8 million followers were left with one unanswered question.</p>
<p class="">Britney, who has been repeatedly asked if she is "okay" as 
her own Instagram followers fear both for her mental health and her 
status amid her <a href="file:///129683/britney-spears-chained-up-album-art-linked-to-conservatorship-cr">2008-commenced conservatorship</a>, had ignored addressing the much-debated issue. More below.</p>

<h2>Talks 'Chili Dogs' And 'Designer Clothes'</h2>
<p><span> Britney Spears/Instagram </span></p>
<p>Britney's video, seen below, showed her in the usual spot she's known
 for popping up in. That's one blank wall, and one stunning blonde in a 
floral crop top in front of it. "Ok, so a lot of fans have been asking 
me a lot of questions," Britney began, with the vibe suggesting that 
she'd be answering the most-asked questions. "I listened," Britney 
continued, speaking of the "comments" she's been reading.</p>
<p>Britney revealed that her favorite song is "Toxic" – the singer 
couldn't come up with her "favorite song in the whole world." Turks 
&amp; Caicos alongside Hawaii were revealed as Britney's favorite places
 to visit. The "Circus" singer also sent major props to chili dogs.</p>
<h2>'The Most Asked Question Is Are You Okay...We're Worried'</h2>
<p><span> Britney Spears/Instagram </span></p>
<p>Britney continued with the limited "favorites" list – her three 
wishes were for "love, happiness, and a world supply of designer 
clothes." It's worth noting here that the star who made <a href="https://www.eonline.com/uk/news/1064561/red-alert-britney-spears-went-to-target-80-times-last-year" rel="noopener">80 trips to Target</a> in 2018 and shouted out 2020 Pride in a budget Pretty Little Thing dress isn't hugely into flashing designer goods – the odd <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1MOKuXAFUW/" rel="noopener">$6,000 Christian Louboutin shoe</a>, aside. The comments section is where it really took off.</p>
<p>Over 730 likes were left to a reply reading: "The most asked question
 is if you are okay...... we are all worried..." Scroll for more.</p>
<h2>Suggestions She 'Can't Talk', Isn't 'Allowed' To Reply To Comments</h2>
<p><span> Britney Spears/Instagram </span></p>
<p>Just yesterday, Britney updated with another floral crop top snap. 
"May this gracious beautiful summer help us all spread our wings and fly
 to where our hearts truly desire," she wrote. Over 2,400 likes were 
left to a reply asking: "Brit are you ok???"</p>
<p>Also liked were remarks deeming the much-misunderstood songstress 
"not okay" – most alarming, however, were suggestions that the star 
whose finances and legal aspects are controlled by her father and his 
lawyer is, somehow, controlled and not permitted to speak.</p>
<p>"She can't talk," one fan wrote. As another stated that "most have 
detected that something is likely wrong," more replies came in to 
suggest that Britney won't be informing her fans of her "okay" status – 
because she just isn't permitted to.</p>

<h2>Addressed 'Mean' Comments As 'Bullying'</h2>
<p><span> Britney Spears/Instagram </span></p>
<p>Britney is not active in the comments section to her Instagram. The 
star who has been deemed both happy and stable and the exact opposite 
this year has, however, spoken for herself. In March, Britney <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/britney-spears-instagram-bullying-mean-comments-response-a9408091.html" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<p>“Reading all of the mean comments really hurts my feelings... and I 
wanted to share because you really shouldn’t be saying all of these mean
 things to someone you don’t even know… this goes for bullying anyone 
really!!!!!!”</p>
<p>#FreeBritney rages on. Likewise, the star's lack of freedom, with her conservatorship <a href="file:///c/britney-spears-conservatorship-cancelled-coronavirus-covid-19-court-videos-photos-quaratined">extended until at least August</a> on account of the global pandemic.</p>
