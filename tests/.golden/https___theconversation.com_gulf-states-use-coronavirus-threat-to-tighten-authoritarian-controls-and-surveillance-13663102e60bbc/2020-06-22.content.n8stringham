<figcaption> A man is tested for coronavirus at a drive-through facility in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. <span><span>Mahmoud Khaled/EPA</span></span> </figcaption><p>Governments
 across the Middle East have moved to upgrade their surveillance 
capabilities under the banner of combatting COVID-19, the disease linked
 to the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>Overtly <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Political_Military_Relations_and_the_Sta.html?id=Ac3cAAAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;redir_esc=y">repressive policies</a>
 have been commonplace across the Middle East for years, notably in 
Egypt, Iraq and Syria, where violent measures have been taken to control
 populations. </p>
<p>As a result of technological advances, an increase in political 
engagement and changes of leadership, the states of the Gulf Cooperation
 Council (GCC) – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the 
United Arab Emirates (UAE) – have also <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/10arabworld.pdf">upgraded their form of authoritarianism</a>
 in recent years. This has seen policies of partial economic 
liberalisation and market-based reforms used to obscure an increase in 
repression and surveillance, for example by containing the work of civil
 society groups. </p>
<p>Following the pattern in which authoritarian states tend to exploit 
common threats, some of the GCC states are now manipulating the current 
pandemic to enhance their social power and control – as I’ve explored in
 a recent <a href="https://pomeps.org/authoritarian-exploitation-of-covid-19-in-the-gcc">article</a> as part of a contribution for the Project on Middle East Political Science at George Washington University. </p>
<h2>New controls</h2>
<p>In Dubai, nationwide curfews have been put in place and enforced by the <a href="http://www.dxbpermit.gov.ae/">security services</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/16/countries-in-the-middle-east-are-using-ai-to-fight-coronavirus.html">surveillance</a>. Authorities in the UAE have also introduced criminal <a href="https://gulfnews.com/uae/crime/covid-19-temporary-imprisonment-for-spreading-rumours-in-uae-1.1585722668466">penalties</a> for the dissemination of information about the virus deemed to be false. Meanwhile, Bahrain introduced <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/gcc/coronavirus-bahrain-to-use-electronic-tags-for-people-in-quarantine-1.1001903">electronic tags</a> for patients who had tested positive for COVID-19. In Saudi Arabia, people have been arrested for <a href="https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/saudi/covid-19-34-curfew-violators-nabbed-in-saudi-arabia-1.1587299810053">violating strict curfew laws</a>. </p>
<p>Beijing’s recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-52321529">admission</a>
 that more people had died than originally reported in Wuhan, the 
original epicentre of the pandemic, shows the fragile nature of 
information and truth within authoritarian states. Likewise, it’s 
difficult to assess the scale of who has been affected so far across the
 GCC. According to official government statistics as <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">of April 21</a>,
 there were 10,484 reported cases in Saudi Arabia and 103 deaths from 
COVID-19. The UAE had reported 7,265 cases and 43 deaths, Qatar 6,105 
ases and nine deaths and Kuwait 2,080 cases and 11 deaths.</p>
<p>China’s <a href="https://theconversation.com/chinas-coronavirus-cover-up-how-censorship-and-propaganda-obstructed-the-truth-133095">handling of its own early COVID-19 whistleblowers</a>
 showed how authoritarian states often react promptly to the 
dissemination of news which could undermine their authority. Of course, 
the curtailing of “fake news” during this time is important to prevent 
hysteria and panic. </p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/01/matthew-hedges-uae-held-me-spy-west-complicit/581200/">from my own experience</a>
 of being forcibly detained for six months and falsely accused of spying
 charges in the UAE, I know full well how these laws can be abused and 
twisted for ulterior purposes. The real test will be to see if all of 
these preventative laws are relaxed once the pandemic is under control.</p>
<figcaption> <span>A market in Salmiya, Kuwait, is disinfected in early April.</span> <span><span>Noufal Ibrahim/EPA</span></span> </figcaption><p>The
 inherent weaknesses of GCC states are also being further exposed 
through this pandemic. GCC citizens only inadvertently hold the power of
 accountability over their monarchies, due to the lack of formal 
political mechanisms that generate and provide legitimacy in 
democracies. In essence, the monarchs hold power until they don’t.</p>
<p>In response, Middle Eastern states have introduced programmes in 
recent years that emphasise cultural traditions in an attempt to further
 centralise power using key figures within their regime. A recent 
anti-corruption drive in Saudi Arabia, which climaxed with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/06/how-saudi-elite-became-five-star-prisoners-at-the-riyadh-ritz-carlton">Ritz-Carlton incident</a>
 in which more than 30 elite figures were detained in a luxury hotel, 
highlighted the ascendancy of Mohammed Bin Salman, the crown prince. </p>
<p>In the UAE, the security state has been intensified through the creation of <a href="https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/social-affairs/preserving-the-emirati-national-identity/initiatives-to-preserve-the-national-identity-of-the-uae/the-uae-national-service-law">conscription</a> programmes which emphasise national identity under the patronage of Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. </p>
<h2>Biopolitics</h2>
<p>Central to the current messaging around COVID-19 is the heightened 
value of “purity” within the nation. This notion has been promoted 
through the prism of the family, with the region’s rulers extending the 
meaning to include the nation in an attempt to retain cohesiveness. In 
the current context, for example, only one member of a family is allowed
 to pick up food during the lockdown in some Gulf states, and there have
 been greater protections imposed for nationals than non-nationals, many
 of whom <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b4f3c258-7ec9-477c-92f7-5607203f77fc">have been deported</a>.</p>
<p>But this comes at a moment when the so-called purity of the family 
unit is under threat as dowry costs, marriages to foreigners and divorce
 rates are <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331436638_Tribe_and_Tribalism_The_Trojan_Horse_of_GCC_States_The_Anatomy_of_a_Crisis">all increasing across the GCC</a>. This has helped maintain a heightened significance of the family within GCC politics. As a result, issues such as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-women/saudi-promo-video-labels-feminism-atheism-homosexuality-as-extremist-ideas-idUSKBN1XL29Z">homosexuality</a>, marriage to foreigners and now even COVID-19 are seen as a threat which has the potential to dilute the national gene pool. </p>
<p>The GCC states are also capitalising on a new vein of conservative 
nationalism across the region that is highly personalised and driven by 
security concerns. An era of assertive foreign policy from Riyadh, Abu 
Dhabi and Doha is now playing out as a matter of principle and survival.
 As a result, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have fortified their political 
and military engagements. Their closer ties with regional players such 
as Libya’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/suspected-military-supplies-libya-un-cargo">General Khalifa Haftar</a> and pro-government Yemeni <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/25/yemen-saudi-forces-torture-disappear-yemenis">forces</a> have helped keep these conflicts alive within a reduced footprint. </p>
<p>Back home, the GCC states have exploited the underlying threats of 
the virus to bolster their own survival strategies. In the past, 
authoritarian states such as the former Soviet Union often relied on 
crude illustrations of force alongside state propaganda. But the modern 
authoritarians in the GCC take a more co-optive route to manage their 
populations. They have been able to enact policies which undermine civil
 liberties, perpetuating their current political designs and generating 
no protest from their populations. So it’s crucial to understand how 
these practices are maintained, why they have the population’s consent, 
and upon what basis they will continue to be applied.</p>
