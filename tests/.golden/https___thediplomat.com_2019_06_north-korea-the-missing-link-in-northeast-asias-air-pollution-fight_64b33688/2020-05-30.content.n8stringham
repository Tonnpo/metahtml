<h1 class="rm-manual"> North Korea: The Missing Link in Northeast Asia’s Air Pollution Fight </h1>
<p class="rm-manual">South Korea and China have made progress in 
addressing the deadly issue of fine dust, but North Korea’s engagement 
is necessary too.</p>

<p><span>According to the WHO, </span><a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.BODAMBIENTAIRDTHS?lang=en"><span>89</span></a><span>
 North Koreans in every 100,000 died from ambient air pollution in 2016.
 China’s rapid industrialization and North Korea’s aging domestic 
thermoelectric power plants are mainly responsible for this health 
threat. Forest degradation is another contributing factor. In Asia, 
North Korea has become the country with the third fastest rate of 
degradation. From 1990 to 2015, </span><a href="https://lcluc.umd.edu/hotspot/deforestation-north-korea"><span>North Korea lost the highest percentage</span></a><span> of its forest in East Asia.</span></p>
<p><span>North Korea has taken very few steps to mitigate this issue 
despite its vulnerability. This vacuum of effective countermeasures 
exposes the North Korean population to the serious dangers of fine dust.
 </span></p>
<p>Fine dust is an extremely small particle that easily penetrates the 
respiratory tract and damages the system through direct contact with the
 skin, eyes, nose, or throat. Its diameter, usually smaller than 10 
micrometers, is a fifth of the thickness of the human hair. According to
 the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention, fine dust severely
 <a href="http://www.cdc.go.kr/CDC/mobile/info/CdcKrInfo0301.jsp?menuIds=HOME001-MNU1154-MNU0005-MNU0037-MNU1380&amp;cid=79429">increases the possibility </a>of ischemic heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p><span>Despite the problem’s gravity, simple preventative efforts such as </span><a href="https://www.nknews.org/2019/03/fine-particle-dust-engulfs-pyongyang-but-most-citizens-unprotected/?c=1558667911052"><span>mask wearing</span></a><span> are still not common among North Korean citizens.</span> <span>State
 media does not provide enough information regarding fine dust. A 
majority of the population lacks knowledge about the dangers and the 
protective measures that they can take.</span></p>
<p><span>As with many environmental issues, the problem is horizontal, affecting neighboring countries such as China and South Korea. </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/15/asia/asia-smog-pollution-intl/index.html"><span>All three countries suffer from massive smog</span></a><span> with fine particles. South Korea </span><a href="https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=72722"><span>had the worst air quality</span></a><span> among the 35 OECD member countries in 2017 and </span><a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/2166542/air-pollution-killing-1-million-people-and-costing-chinese"><span>a study</span></a><span>
 shows that the negative effect of air pollution in China costs about 
$38 billion annually. Beijing and Seoul, however, are making efforts to 
counter the situation.</span></p>

<p><span>As a result of several talks, there are projects already in 
process. Real-time air quality data from 38 cities in China and South 
Korea is directly </span><a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20151031045000004"><span>shared</span></a><span>. This information is used for joint academic </span><a href="http://www.ndsl.kr/ndsl/search/detail/report/reportSearchResultDetail.do?cn=TRKO201600015710"><span>research</span></a><span>,
 policy decisions, and an advanced alert system. It also enables more 
effective and accurate preventive measures. Although not binding, </span><a href="http://webbook.me.go.kr/DLi-File/091/025/003/5631039.pdf"><span>numerous agreements are being signed</span></a><span> and cooperation centers are conducting researches on the issue. </span></p>
<p><span>The two countries continue to strengthen cooperation. South 
Korea and China have held a number of ministerial- and working-level 
talks to boost cooperation to minimize the damage. According to the 
South Korean Ministry of Environment, South Korea and China </span><a href="http://eng.me.go.kr/eng/web/board/read.do?pagerOffset=0&amp;maxPageItems=10&amp;maxIndexPages=10&amp;searchKey=&amp;searchValue=&amp;menuId=21&amp;orgCd=&amp;boardId=965205&amp;boardMasterId=522&amp;boardCategoryId=&amp;decorator="><span>will consult with each other</span></a><span>
 on ways to jointly implement emergency mitigation measures and promote 
an artificial rainfall technology exchange. Such efforts </span><span><a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190502011600315">are continuing</a>, </span><span>as
 the National Council on Climate and Air Quality in South Korea is 
working to realize a visit to China to discuss further actions in coping
 with the challenge.</span></p>
<p><span>There is gradual progress in the Ministry of Environment’s 
plans to cooperate with China in order to minimize the influence of fine
 dust from foreign countries. It is expected that the accuracy of 
forecasting on fine dust will be </span><a href="http://eng.me.go.kr/eng/web/board/read.do?pagerOffset=0&amp;maxPageItems=10&amp;maxIndexPages=10&amp;searchKey=&amp;searchValue=&amp;menuId=21&amp;orgCd=&amp;boardId=965205&amp;boardMasterId=522&amp;boardCategoryId=&amp;decorator="><span>improved</span></a><span>
 through the full-scale operation of early warning systems. While 
efforts are being made to discuss concerted efforts and measures to 
reduce fine dust, more specific, long-term solutions and ongoing 
cooperation are needed. Joint response cooperation with China has great 
significance as the starting point. </span></p>
<p><span>In contrast to the policies that China and South Korea are 
pursuing, there is neither a well-established air pollution policy nor 
the ability to precisely measure air pollution in North Korea. North 
Korea remains reluctant to make data on fine dust public, while other 
nations are already far ahead, cooperating to identify the disaster.</span></p>
<p><span>It is critical that North Korea become part of the 
comprehensive efforts to combat the fine dust problem, which affects the
 entire region of Northeast Asia. This crisis calls for multilateral 
engagement from neighboring countries and should start with the sharing 
of data and academic exercises. Identifying and analyzing is the first 
step to addressing a problem. Without the disclosure of fine dust data, 
at least to Beijing and Seoul, there is no foundation for cooperation. 
This, along with minimizing the consequences of air pollution, would 
have another positive outcome. Amid sanctions leveled on Pyongyang, this
 effort is a way to offer indirect humanitarian relief to North Korean 
residents. Such cooperation also could act as a stepping stone for 
closing the technology gap among the countries. Lastly, the increase in 
constructive communication among the three countries will be the most 
important diplomatic victory for the international community.</span></p>
