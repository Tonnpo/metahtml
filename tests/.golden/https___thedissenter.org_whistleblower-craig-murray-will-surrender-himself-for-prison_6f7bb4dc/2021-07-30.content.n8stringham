<p>"I go to jail with a clean conscience after a Kafkaesque trial," Murray stated.</p>
<figcaption>Craig Murray (Photo: Mohamed Elmaazi)</figcaption><p>In the 
case against former United Kingdom diplomat-turned whistleblower Craig 
Murray, the UK supreme court refused to hear Murray’s appeal. He will 
now surrender himself to police for an eight-month prison sentence.</p>
<p>The High Court in Edinburgh in Scotland convicted Murray of contempt 
on March 25 after concluding that he published several blog posts, which
 they believe led people to identify witnesses in the sexual assault 
trial against former Scottish Minister Alex Salmond. </p>
<p>Murray is the first person in the U.K. to be incarcerated for media 
contempt in over a half century. It has been 70 years since someone was 
incarcerated in Scotland on this charge.</p>
<p>“I go to jail with a clean conscience after a Kafkaesque trial,” 
Murray declared in a press statement. “I genuinely do not know who I am 
supposed to have identified or which phrases I published are said to 
have identified them, in combination with [details] in the public 
domain.”</p>
<p>“This judgment will have a chilling effect on reporting of the 
defense case at trials to the detriment of justice, and the different 
treatment of bloggers and approved media is sinister,” Murray added. </p>
<p>Murray maintained he carefully protected the “identities of the accusers” in his reports. </p>
<p>Previously, Mohamed Elmaazi <a href="https://thedissenter.org/whistleblower-craig-murray-sentenced-to-8-months-in-prison-over-his-reporting-on-former-scottish-first-ministers-trial/">covered</a>
 this political prosecution for The Dissenter. He described how the 
judges found Murray guilty of “jigsaw identification,” which refers to 
the “possibility that a person may piece together information from 
various sources to arrive at the identification of a protected witness.”</p>
<p>“In doing so, the judge ruled that Murray violated a court order 
prohibiting the publication of information that could likely lead to the
 identification of the alleged victims in Salmond’s case,” Elmaazi 
wrote.</p>
<p>Murray is a former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, a whistleblower,
 a broadcaster, a human rights advocate, and a journalist known for his 
writings on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s case. He supported 
Salmond, who was acquitted on all 14 counts of sexual harassment and 
assault, and he has backed the campaign for Scottish independence.</p>
<p>The High Court of Scotland, as Elmaazi detailed, “reviewed the 
investigation and handling of Salmond's case, determined that the 
process was ‘unlawful,’ ‘procedurally unfair,’ and ‘tainted by apparent 
bias,’ a year before the trial commenced."</p>
<p>Additionally, Murray contended, “I believe this is actually the 
state’s long sought revenge for my whistleblowing on security service 
collusion with torture and my long term collaboration with WikiLeaks and
 other whistleblowers. Unfortunately, important free speech issues are 
collateral damage.”</p>
<p>He planned to travel to Spain to provide witness testimony in the 
criminal case against UC Global director David Morales, the private 
security company implicated in spying against Assange, his legal team, 
and journalists and visitors who met with him while he was in the 
Ecuador embassy. </p>
<p>According to the Craig Murray Justice Campaign, there are several 
hours of surveillance video of Murray talking privately with Assange 
about his future and the future of WikiLeaks. But the Scottish court 
“removed Murray’s passport,” blocking his participation in the espionage
 case.</p>
<p>Murray plans to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights and exhaust all possible avenues to clear his name. </p>
<p>Particularly, Murray, his supporters, and some press freedom 
advocates are bothered by the way Lady Leeona Dorrian expressed her view
 that bloggers should be treated differently than establishment 
journalists because they are more likely to show restraint. </p>
<p>Murray’s wife and mother of his two children urged solidarity from 
anyone concerned about how this case threatens freedom of expression as 
well as “equality before the law.”</p>
