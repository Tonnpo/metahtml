<p class="rm-manual"><span>March 07, 2011</span><span><a href="file:///p/authors.html" rel="author">Mohit Kumar</a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Concerns about North Korea's cyber warfare squads are 
resurfacing after Friday's cyber and GPS jamming attacks, which are 
being blamed on the North. Pyongyang began developing electronic warfare
 capabilities in 1986 when it founded Mirim University, the present-day 
Automation University, to train specialists. A defector who graduated 
from the university recalled that 25 Russian professors were invited 
from the Frunze Military Academy in the former Soviet Union to give 
lectures, and some 100 to 110 hackers were trained there every year. 
Mirim is a five-year college. The Amrokgang College of Military 
Engineering, the National Defense University, the Air Force Academy and 
the Naval Academy are also reportedly training electronic warfare 
specialists. Jang Se-yul of North Korean People's Liberation Front, an 
organization of former North Korean military officers and servicemen, 
recalled that when he fled the North in 2007, "I heard that the North 
Korean military has about 30,000 electronic warfare specialists, 
including some 1,200 personnel under two electronic warfare brigades." 
"Each Army corps operates an automation unit, or an electronic warfare 
unit." Jang used to be an officer of a North Korean electronic warfare 
command.</span></span></p>
<p> <span><span>Material published by the North Korean Army in 2005 
quotes leader Kim Jong-il as saying, "Modern war is electronic warfare. 
Victory or defeat of a modern war depends on how to carry out electronic
 warfare." In a 2006 report, the South Korean military warned North 
Korean hackers could paralyze the command post of the U.S. Pacific 
Command and damage computer systems on the U.S. mainland. Experts 
believe that the North's 600 or so special hackers are as good as their 
CIA counterparts. They attempted in August 2008 to hack the computer of a
 colonel in South Korean Field Army headquarters. In 1999, the U.S. 
Defense Department said the most frequent visitor to its website was 
traced to North Korea. Due to economic difficulties since the 1990s, the
 North Korean regime had a hard time boosting its conventional military 
capabilities and instead focused on strengthening so-called asymmetric 
capabilities that would allow it to achieve relatively large effects 
with small expenses. That includes not only nuclear and biochemical 
weapons and missiles but also special forces and hackers.</span></span></p>
