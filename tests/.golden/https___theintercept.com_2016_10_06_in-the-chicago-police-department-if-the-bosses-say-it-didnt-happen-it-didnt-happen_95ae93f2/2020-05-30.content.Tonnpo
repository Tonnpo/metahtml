<p class=""><span> Part 1 </span></p>
<p>Two young officers began to hear rumors of a drug gang operating 
within the Chicago Police Department. They were skeptical at first.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Share the whole series</span></p>
<p><span><span> O</span></span> n May 31, the city of Chicago agreed to 
settle a whistleblower lawsuit brought by two police officers who allege
 they suffered retaliation for reporting and investigating criminal 
activity by fellow officers. The settlement, for $2 million, was 
announced moments before the trial was to begin.</p>
<p>As the trial date approached, city lawyers had made a motion to 
exclude the words “code of silence” from the proceedings. Not only was 
the motion denied, but the judge ruled that Mayor Rahm Emanuel could be 
called to testify about what he meant when he used the term in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-7GleZGTOU">a speech</a>
 he delivered to the City Council last December, at the height of the 
political firestorm provoked by the police shooting of 17-year-old 
Laquan McDonald.</p>
<p>In that speech, Emanuel broke with the city’s long history of denying
 the existence of the code of silence. He spoke of “problems at the very
 heart of the policing profession,” and said: “This problem is sometimes
 referred to as the Thin Blue Line. Other times it’s referred to as the 
code of silence. It is the tendency to ignore, deny, or in some cases 
cover up the bad actions of a colleague or colleagues.”</p>
<p>The prevailing narrative in the press was that the city settled in 
order to avoid the possibility that Mayor Emanuel would be compelled to 
testify. But the mayor’s testimony, had it come to pass, would have been
 unlikely to provide much illumination. By contrast, that of the 
plaintiffs, Shannon Spalding and Danny Echeverria, promised to be 
revelatory. In the words of Judge Gary Feinerman, they have a story to 
tell that “purports to show extraordinarily serious retaliatory 
misconduct by officers at nearly all levels of the CPD hierarchy.”</p>

<p><span><span> W</span></span> hen I first met Shannon Spalding in 
2013, she was in despair. She had risked everything to bring to light 
corruption within the Chicago Police Department, she said, yet no one 
believed her.</p>
<p>In brief, Spalding recounted that she and her partner, Danny 
Echeverria, spent over five years working undercover on a joint FBI-CPD 
internal affairs investigation that uncovered a massive criminal 
enterprise within the department. A gang tactical team led by a sergeant
 named Ronald Watts operated a protection racket in public housing 
developments on Chicago’s South Side. In exchange for “a tax,” Watts and
 his team shielded drug dealers from interference by law enforcement and
 targeted their competition. Their operation went far beyond shaking 
down the occasional drug dealer. They were major players in the drug 
trade on the South Side.</p>
<p>The investigation had multiple targets. Beyond Watts, it was focused 
on members of his team and senior officials suspected of conspiring with
 him. It was also rumored both on the street and in the department that 
Watts was involved in the murders of two drug dealers who defied him.</p>
<p>When Spalding and Echeverria were on the verge of breaking the case 
open, the investigation was sabotaged by a high-ranking official who 
outed them as “rats.” Other CPD brass ordered officers under their 
command to retaliate against Spalding and Echeverria for violating the 
code of silence. Reprisals were especially harsh against Spalding, 
leaving her financially devastated, suffering from post-traumatic stress
 disorder, and stripped of the job she loves.</p>
<p>When we first spoke three years ago, Spalding’s despair arose not 
from self-doubt — her conviction about the substance of her story was 
unshakeable — but from her awareness of the forces arrayed against her. 
She was oppressed by the knowledge that CPD brass had the power to 
impose upon the world their own version of reality and in the process 
portray her as delusional.</p>
<p>“I call it Operation Smoke and Mirrors,” she said at the time. “If 
four bosses in the department say it didn’t happen, it didn’t happen.”</p>
<p>While the term “code of silence” evokes something essential — the 
coerced silence of police officers who observe but do not report abuses 
by their fellow officers — it is, in some respects, a misnomer, a 
euphemism. The practices to which it refers are less a matter of silence
 than of tightly orchestrated lying and various means used to maintain 
narrative control.</p>
<p>Today, in the wake of the political upheaval in Chicago precipitated 
by the Laquan McDonald case, the CPD has lost control of the narrative. 
This creates space for Shannon Spalding’s voice finally to be heard. </p>
<p>This article tells her story. It is based on extensive interviews 
with Spalding conducted over the last three years. It also draws on 
interviews with Echeverria and several others who figure in the case, 
and on the record generated in the course of pretrial discovery. Aided 
by notes she kept on a daily basis over the years, Spalding gives a 
richly detailed account of the code of silence not as a vague “culture” 
among the rank and file but as a set of institutional mechanisms central
 to the operation of the CPD.</p>
<p>To be clear at the outset: The police officials named as defendants 
in the whistleblower lawsuit — Chief Juan Rivera, Cmdr. James O’Grady, 
Chief Nick Roti, Sgt. Maurice Barnes, Lt. Robert Cesario, Sgt. Thomas 
Mills, and Cmdr. Joseph Salemme — deny the plaintiffs’ allegations. <span>In
 addition to citing their denials in the public record, efforts have 
been made to contact each of the defendants, as well as the other law 
enforcement officials who figure in the story. Each either did not 
respond, could not be located, or declined to comment. </span>The 
Chicago Police Department and the city’s Department of Law both said 
they do not comment on active investigations or litigation. The 
defendants’ depositions, affidavits, and sworn statements, in which they
 contest Spalding and Echeverria’s version of events, are available <a href="http://invisible.institute/jamie-kalven/watts-documents/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The counternarrative that emerges from the defendants’ legal 
arguments is that Spalding and Echeverria played at best a marginal role
 in the Watts investigation, serving as little more than handlers for a 
confidential informant, and that they — particularly Spalding — were 
problem officers others did not want to work with. In a February 2015 
press release about the case, the city stated that “Superintendent 
[Garry] McCarthy and the CPD have zero tolerance for retaliation against
 whistleblowers,” but “the city believes the claims of these particular 
plaintiffs are without merit.”</p>
<p>According to Spalding, the united front of the defendants against 
charges of retaliation under the code of silence is the ultimate 
expression of the code. If she is telling the truth, a group of 
high-ranking police officials are lying in concert and under oath.</p>

<p> <span><span> F</span></span>rom the start, Spalding’s career was 
braided with that of Ronald Watts. When she joined the department in 
1996, he was among the first officers she met. As a rookie, she was 
assigned to ride with him as part of her training. Over the years, they 
remained on friendly terms. And throughout their careers, they worked 
the same streets — the 2nd District on the South Side — during an era of
 turbulent change. </p>
<p>While both are native South Siders, they grew up in different worlds,
 on opposite sides of one of the starkest racial boundaries in the city:
 the bridge over the railroad tracks (and later the Dan Ryan Expressway)
 that separates the neighborhood of Bridgeport, long the stronghold of 
the Daley political dynasty, from the heart of the black South Side.</p>

<p>Blond and Irish, Spalding was raised among the many police officers 
and firefighters who make their homes in Bridgeport. Watts grew up on 
the other side of the bridge in public housing. When he joined the 
department and came to the 2nd District in 1994, after a stint in the 
Army, he already knew the streets and the players. </p>
<p>Roughly 2 square miles, the 2nd District encompasses the heart of the
 old Black Belt, the African-American city within the city under 
segregation, which absorbed wave after wave of migrants from the South, 
then with the end of legal segregation, like a great swollen river, 
overflowed its banks and spilled into other South Side neighborhoods. 
Once the most densely populated part of the city, it was by the 1990s 
riddled with abandoned buildings and vacant lots. And it contained an 
extraordinary amount of public housing.</p>
<p>While some of that housing was built before World War II as 
segregated housing for blacks — notably the Ida B. Wells Homes, a 
sprawling row-house development — most was constructed after the United 
States Supreme Court struck down racially restrictive covenants. Yet it 
conformed to traditional patterns of segregation. Confronted with 
opposition from white aldermen who didn’t want public housing in their 
wards, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) in the 1950s and 1960s had 
built developments in traditionally black areas of the South and West 
Sides.</p>
<p>The most extraordinary manifestation of this segregation was the 
so-called South State Street corridor, more than 2 continuous miles of 
public housing high-rises — the Robert Taylor Homes and Stateway Gardens
 — and several smaller mid-rise developments a few blocks farther north.
 By the 1990s, the corridor was said to be the single largest 
concentration of poverty in the nation.</p>
<p>That was the world Shannon Spalding entered when she came to the 2nd 
District as a rookie and was assigned to ride with Ronald Watts.</p>

<p>“It was culture shock for me,” she recalled recently. “I was in a 
world I didn’t understand. I was lost. So I needed to learn. He schooled
 me.” </p>
<p>As they drove through the streets and alleys of the district, Watts 
shared his knowledge of gangs and drugs with her. Because the drug trade
 takes such distinctive forms in high-rise public housing, said 
Spalding, “housing police are a breed apart.” Watts, in her view, was 
one of the best.</p>
<p>The world they moved through was dominated by two gangs, the Gangster
 Disciples and the Black Disciples. Between them they controlled the 
drug trade in public housing. Each operated out of particular 
high-rises, often at the same development, which were identified 
accordingly as “GD” and “BD” buildings.</p>
<p>Night and day, an endless parade of customers was served by the young
 men in the open-air lobbies of the high-rises. At various locations 
around the perimeters of the buildings, solitary figures stood watch for
 12-hour shifts “doing security.” Most were older men and women. Almost 
all were drug users who supported their habits by doing this work. Like 
street criers, they sang out the names of the drugs sold in the 
particular building — “Dog Face!” “Titanic!” “USDA!” — and acted as 
lookouts. If a police car approached, they called out a warning — “Blue 
and white northbound on Federal” — and the message was relayed from 
voice to voice into the interior shadows of the drug bazaar.</p>
<p>An unintended byproduct of the design of the high-rise developments —
 they had been conceived, in the architectural idiom of the day, as 
“towers in the park” — was that you could see the police coming from a 
long way off. As a countermeasure, gang tactical officers, “the jump out
 boys,” often drove up on the buildings at high speeds, careening across
 the grounds and sidewalks, in an effort to grab the young men before 
they had a chance to flee up the stairs and disappear into an apartment 
or vacant unit. There were frequent arrests. Then, as the police drove 
away, the drug market would reopen for business.</p>
<p>Tellingly, both drug dealers and police refer to the cat-and-mouse 
maneuvers of the drug trade as “the game.” For one side, the object is 
to intercept, for the other, to evade. In the era before public housing 
on the South Side was demolished, the setting for this contest was 
derelict high-rises, housing impoverished families, through which wealth
 constantly circulated. In order to meet the never-ending demand, new 
“packages” of drugs were regularly delivered and stashed in secret 
locations, such as vacant units, utility closets, mailboxes, or garbage 
chutes. Money was harvested and hauled away. (The younger brother of a 
major drug dealer once described to me a vacant unit filled with grocery
 bags of cash — like tobacco curing in a shed.)</p>
<p>As they drove through the developments, Spalding recalled, Watts would point things out to her.</p>
<p>The Stateway Gardens complex in the Bronzeville neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, pictured in 1958.</p>
<p> Photo: Hedrich Blessing Collection/Chicago History Museum/Getty Images</p>
<p>“Look,” he said one day. “See how they’re rolling the dumpsters out 
into the fire lane? They’re going to start shooting soon.” The dumpsters
 would function as barriers against drive-bys. Similarly, he warned her 
to be careful running into the lobbies at Stateway Gardens, because the 
young men had strategically placed railroad ties — delivered to the 
development for landscaping projects — to trip up the police. </p>
<p>Spalding eagerly absorbed Watts’s instruction — “I learned something 
every day” — and enjoyed his company. “He was a likeable person, easy to
 be around,” she said. “He sometimes joked with me — ‘OK, Susie 
Homemaker, you can leave your apron at home today’ — but he was always 
friendly and respectful.”</p>
<p>There was one incident during this period, however, that gave her 
pause. They were on the grounds of Stateway Gardens. Watts identified a 
stolen car, and they took off in pursuit. The driver ditched the car and
 ran toward one of the buildings. Spalding began to run after him. Watts
 called her back. “He really went off on me. It didn’t seem to fit with 
the situation.”</p>
<p>When they searched the car, they found a “trap” — a hidden 
compartment — full of money. She had no role in inventorying the money. 
Shaken, she tried to understand what had just happened. Watts explained 
that he was trying to protect her, that he didn’t want her running into 
the high-rise alone. She was unpersuaded. There was no doubt in her mind
 she could have caught the suspect before he reached the building. The 
incident stayed with her and troubled her. “It didn’t seem right.”</p>
<p>On balance, though, she came away with high regard for Watts as “a 
good cop who got solid information and good results.” And she was 
impressed by the respect he seemed to command on the street. Major gang 
leaders, who wouldn’t engage with other officers, would talk to him.</p>

<p> <span><span> O</span></span> nce she began to get her bearings, 
Spalding found herself powerfully drawn to the world of public housing. 
“I was like Christopher Columbus, discovering a new world. I loved going
 to work. It was so fascinating.” </p>
<p>She developed an easy rapport with the residents, including gang 
members and drug dealers. Her nickname on the street, inevitably, was 
“Blondie.”</p>
<p>“You’re only as good as your word,” she observed. “Trust isn’t given.
 It’s earned. The boys would say, ‘Blondie was always fair.’ I never 
took their money. I never put drugs on them. They were locked up all the
 time for things they didn’t do. I earned their respect. So they would 
tell me things.”</p>
<p>She used to say to them, “I’ve got two rules. Don’t lie and don’t 
run. If you do, all bets are off.” She laughed. “I was running like a 
Kenyan back then. I could run 10 miles a day. I had the world’s best 
Stairmaster — CHA high-rises.”</p>
<p>“Everyone who has ever helped me in an investigation is an invisible 
person. They’re prostitutes, drug dealers, the homeless, children. The 
people most cops don’t see. Think about it. Who sees more of what’s 
going on than the homeless and hookers?”</p>
<p>When the opportunity arose in 1997, Spalding joined the public 
housing south unit and began to work full time in the public housing 
developments on the South Side. It’s hard to evoke how utterly abandoned
 these communities were at this point in their history. One measure is 
that in 1995 the federal government had seized control of the CHA from 
the city. The Department of Housing and Urban Development official 
installed as director of the CHA, Joseph Shuldiner, had previously run 
the New York and Los Angeles housing authorities. In a recent interview,
 he observed that in addition to the degree of concentration and 
abandonment, Chicago’s public housing differed from New York’s in two 
critical respects. The tenant population was much poorer. And while the 
NYPD had continued to do vertical patrols, the CPD had long ago ceded 
any real control of public housing high-rises.</p>
<p>Despite the shadow play of enforcement, the developments were de 
facto vice zones where the sale of drugs was tolerated. Policing largely
 took the form of containment. The policy was to keep it in this box. 
Only when crime spilled out of the box did intervention become 
necessary.</p>
<p>Frustrated by the CPD’s lack of responsiveness to the needs of its 
residents, the CHA had created its own police force in 1989. Spalding 
and other officers from CPD’s public housing unit would regularly work 
on joint operations with the CHA police.</p>
<p>After several years of federal management, Richard M. Daley’s 
administration regained control of the CHA in 1999 and launched the Plan
 for Transformation, its strategy for replacing concentrations of 
high-rise public housing with “mixed-income communities.” The 
administration’s rhetoric sang of inclusion, community renewal, and 
individual advancement. Mayor Daley was fond of saying, with 
characteristic fervor, “We’re not only rebuilding neighborhoods, we’re 
rebuilding souls.” But the reality on the ground was land clearance: The
 objective was to demolish every public housing high-rise in the city 
and do so as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p>By 2000, as the plan began to gather momentum, Chicago’s archipelago 
of public housing high-rises had taken on the aspect of a vast armada of
 ships loaded with boat people, just offshore, destined to be sunk one 
by one.</p>

<p><span><span> A</span></span> mong the first things the city did after
 regaining control of the CHA from the federal government was disband 
the 270-member CHA police force and replace it with CPD officers. This 
required rapid expansion of the public housing unit. The city had a $30 
million federal grant for the purpose and ultimately hired 375 
additional officers. Cmdr. Ernie Brown was appointed to head the unit, 
which was comprised of public housing south and public housing north, 
both under Brown’s command.</p>
<p>When public housing south expanded, Ronald Watts, now a sergeant, 
joined the unit as a supervisor. He and Ernie Brown, according to 
Spalding, were said to be friends. Watts brought with him the core of 
the tactical team he had worked with in the 2nd District and would work 
with throughout his career: his partner, Kallatt Mohammed, along with 
Alvin Jones, Brian Bolton, and Bobby Gonzalez.</p>
<p>The expanded public housing unit brought together a large number of 
officers who had never worked together before, as well as some who had. 
“Cops are gossips,” observed Spalding, and the unit was awash in rumors.
 There was talk about shakedowns of drug dealers and about big players 
paying off the police for protection. Some of the rumors focused on 
former CHA officers who made the cut and joined the unit. Others focused
 on Watts and his team. Spalding gave them little weight. Having worked 
with Watts, she was inclined to attribute the rumors to “professional 
envy.”</p>
<p>Knowing what she knows now, she wonders, how did she not see then the corruption she would later help uncover?</p>
<p>“I truly didn’t think it was going on.” And to the extent it was 
going on, she assumed “the bosses” were actively investigating. Looking 
back now, she realizes she wasn’t included in the big busts involving 
large amounts of drugs and money. “I may have had great numbers, but I 
wasn’t with the program.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t hard to shut Spalding out of the action. With only a year 
and a half on the job, she had landed on a gang tactical team. She was 
still learning how things were done. And she was a woman. So she wasn’t 
involved in searches of male suspects and wasn’t in the locker room 
where, she said, “the real planning and scheming goes on.”</p>
<p>Mickey Spaargaren, a friend from Bridgeport who joined the department
 when Spalding did and went to public housing south with her, had a 
different experience. Soon after coming to the unit, he observed 
patterns of corruption involving, among others, a former CHA police 
officer named Joe Seinitz, who had made the cut to join the CPD. 
Eventually, Spaargaren made contact with an FBI special agent named Ken 
Samuels to report on the corruption he was observing within the public 
housing unit.</p>
<p>“I can call anyone and make your life miserable. You better keep your mouth shut.”</p>
<p>Spaargaren was placed on Watts’s team. In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2842758-Spaargaren-Affidavit.html">an affidavit</a>
 he provided in Spalding and Echeverria’s whistleblower case, he stated 
that on multiple occasions the team made large seizures of drugs and 
money that were never entered into the inventory log. Watts would tell 
other members of the team that they could leave, that he and Mohammed 
would do the inventories.</p>
<p>After one major seizure, Spaargaren checked the inventory log the 
following day and found it was empty “as if there had been no bust at 
all.”</p>
<p>He challenged Watts about this. Watts responded that he was “trading 
up” for information that would lead to bigger busts and major arrests. 
Spaargaren was not persuaded.</p>
<p>“Are you accusing me of stealing, Mickey?” Watts yelled at him. 
“Well, fuck you. I’ll put papers on you and make a case on you. The 
projects are dangerous. Be careful. You won’t make it out alive.”</p>
<p>Sometime later, Watts told Spaargaren that his commanding officer, 
Lt. Jimmy Spratte, wanted to talk with him. When Spaargaren informed 
Spratte about the missing inventory, the lieutenant asked him whether he
 had gone to the internal affairs division. Spaargaren said he had not, 
that it was just a suspicion.</p>
<p>“You’re accusing my sergeant and a fellow officer of stealing?” 
Spratte said. “Well, I don’t believe you.” He told Spaargaren he should 
have immediately gone to a supervisor.</p>
<p>“You know what?” Spratte said, “I think you’re the corrupt one, and that’s why you didn’t go to a supervisor.”</p>
<p>Spaargaren denied the accusation. Spratte became agitated.</p>
<p>“Pack your fucking bags, you need to get out of this unit. I’m moving
 you to another team tomorrow. And don’t even think about going to IAD 
now,” he said. “I can call anyone and make your life miserable. You 
better keep your mouth shut. You don’t want to lose your life over this.
 If you report a sergeant to IAD, how long do you think you will last?”</p>
<p>“Mickey was distraught,” recalled Spalding. He decided to take a 
leave of absence from the department and went to headquarters to execute
 the necessary paperwork. When Spratte heard Spaargaren had been down at
 headquarters, he assumed he had gone to internal affairs. They had a 
fierce exchange, which Spalding overheard.</p>
<p>“Spratte,” she said, “lost his mind.”</p>
<p>Before Spaargaren went to the FBI, Spalding had tried to dissuade him
 — she thought he was overreacting — but to no avail. Some months later,
 she was contacted by Special Agent Ken Samuels. They spoke on the phone
 several times. The main topic of conversation was Joe Seinitz. Samuels 
also mentioned in passing several other officers, Watts among them. She 
told him she hadn’t witnessed any criminal activity within the unit.</p>

<p><span><span> N</span></span> either did I. Not at first.</p>
<p>During those years, I was a daily presence on South State Street. I 
had several roles. I was adviser to the Stateway Gardens resident 
council. I developed a program of “grassroots public works” designed to 
create alternatives for gang members. (Full disclosure: I was the source
 of the railroad ties for landscaping projects, repurposed by drug 
dealers, that Watts warned Spalding about.) And as a writer I documented
 conditions on the ground.</p>
<p>It took several years of immersion for me to begin to see the ways 
police were present — and absent — at Stateway. The residents educated 
me. Coming and going to and from their homes, they constantly navigated 
the open-air drug marketplaces “up under the buildings.” Day after day, 
they saw the same dealers in the same positions conducting their 
business. They didn’t have the moral luxury of demonizing them, for they
 knew many of them in other roles besides “gangbanger”: as son or 
nephew, as boyfriend or teammate, as neighbor, as friend. Francine 
Washington, president of the Stateway resident council, used to invoke 
this knowledge by speaking of “our in-laws and our outlaws.”</p>
<p>The nature of law enforcement at Stateway was mystifying. The police 
more often seemed a disruptive presence than a source of order. They 
didn’t patrol the development in a conventional sense. Nor did they 
respond with any consistency to calls for service from residents. They 
mostly interacted with those in and around the drug markets. They would 
“hit the buildings” and make arrests. Yet somehow nothing ever changed.</p>
<p>The picture was further complicated by conscientious, hard-working 
officers one encountered, who were civil toward residents and seemed to 
be trying, however ambiguous their assignments, to do their jobs. It was
 puzzling why they were not more effective.</p>
<p>Residents used to joke about the lobbies as “the policeman’s ATM 
machine.” Short on cash, officers could pop in, take money, drugs, or 
guns off the young men, and go on their way.</p>
<p>In every available forum, residents asked: Why can’t the police shut 
the drug trade down? Why can’t this community have the same sort of law 
enforcement other neighborhoods have? Are the bored young men loitering 
in the lobbies such master criminals? Is the security system of drug 
addicts shouting out warnings so effective the police are unable to 
penetrate it?</p>
<p>An African-American officer in the public housing south unit once 
turned the question around and put it to me this way: “Think of the 
police as the working poor. Create a situation in which there’s lots of 
money and drugs on the street in neighborhoods no one gives a fuck 
about. What do you think is going to happen?”</p>
<p>From my perspective on the ground, the larger forms of alleged 
corruption — the shakedowns and protection rackets, the drugs and money 
seized but never inventoried — were not visible. What was apparent were 
daily street-level abuses. Excessive force was more the norm than the 
exception. For some officers, it was sport. They would grade one another
 on the blows they inflicted. The language of racial invective — 
“nigger,” “monkey,” “hoodrat” — was routine; on occasion, over the 
loudspeakers of police vehicles. There were officers who found it 
amusing to toy with those under their power — arranging a foot race of 
heroin addicts to determine who would go to jail, for example, or 
forcing a woman they had searched on the street to walk home naked from 
the waist down. And then there was the corruption. Residents used to 
joke about the lobbies as “the policeman’s ATM machine.” Short on cash, 
officers could pop in, take money, drugs, or guns off the young men, and
 go on their way.</p>
<p>Some of the most revealing stories I heard alleged that the police 
preyed not only on drug dealers, but also on some of the most vulnerable
 members of the community. While the public housing unit was staffing 
up, the special operations section was deployed to South State Street. 
An elite unit that wasn’t tied to districts, SOS would later implode 
during a scandal involving shakedowns of drug dealers, robberies, and 
kidnappings. It was disbanded in 2007. In 1999, I interviewed a group of
 older women after an SOS team did a sweep of their building. They 
reported money and valued household objects missing. “They don’t just 
steal big money,” said one woman. “They steal little money.”</p>
<p>Similarly, residents told of certain officers who could be counted on
 to show up at the development on the first and 15th of the month — on 
check day — to take money out of the pockets of residents after they 
left the currency exchange.</p>
<p>During more than a decade of immersion in public housing, I was never
 in a position to observe police extort payoffs from drug dealers in 
exchange for protection. Yet I frequently witnessed or heard about 
police conduct that made manifest just how much space there was for 
abuse: A place where police officers can steal grocery money from the 
poorest of the poor and indulge in casual cruelty without fear of 
consequences is a place where anything is possible.</p>

<p><span><span> I</span></span> n 2001, the public housing south unit 
was hit by a major scandal. Two of its members — Sgt. William Patterson 
and Officer Daryl Smith — were caught in an FBI sting, ripping off what 
they believed to be a drug stash house. Their M.O. was to come in on 
their days off and generate phony search warrants. They would then hit a
 drug house, present the bogus warrant, and take everything they could 
lay their hands on. Having bought into the ruse, their victims would 
anxiously await the filing of charges that never came.</p>
<p>The arrest of Patterson and Smith served to fortify Spalding’s trust 
in the institution rather than undermining it. She saw it as proof that 
if officers engaged in serious misconduct, they would be disciplined. 
She also read it as confirmation that FBI investigations of Seinitz and 
Watts had yielded nothing.</p>
<p>In 2004, the public housing south unit was abruptly disbanded. Police
 officials explained that because a number of the CHA high-rises had 
been demolished by that time, a specialized unit was no longer 
necessary. The public housing that remained would be policed by the 
districts and a new roaming “targeted response” unit.</p>
<p>Spalding went to the 1st District, where she became partners with 
Danny Echeverria. He and Spalding had known each other in passing before
 they became partners. Riding together, they became close. Known on the 
street as Blondie and Danny Boy, they worked well together and enjoyed 
each other’s company.</p>
<p>Today their mutual affection and loyalty are evident. They have been 
through a lot together. Like combat veterans or a long-married couple, 
each knows things about the other no one else does, and they have 
amassed narrative wealth to which they hold joint title. Listening to 
them recount, amid crossfire banter, their adventures and misadventures 
in public housing, it’s clear they loved their jobs.</p>
<p>The 1st District was just north of the 2nd District and included the 
Harold Ickes Homes, a mid-rise public housing development that was one 
of the last to be emptied of residents and demolished. As other public 
housing communities were razed, its open-air drug markets became ever 
more active and congested.</p>
<p>After an SOS team did a sweep of their building, a group of older 
women reported money and valued household objects missing. “They don’t 
just steal big money,” said one woman. “They steal little money.”</p>
<p>Spalding and Echeverria attribute a large part of their effectiveness
 in working Ickes to the quality of their confidential informants, 
particularly a homeless man whom drug dealers sometimes used as a 
courier. He would ferry drugs and cash from place to place in a funky 
knapsack no one was disposed to search. They speak of him almost as a 
third partner.</p>
<p>Spalding christened him “Chewbacca” after observing him jump out of a
 dumpster in which he had been foraging, “looking crazy” with long 
anarchic hair and a mouth containing braces but few teeth.</p>
<p>“Somebody,” Echeverria observed of the braces, “must’ve loved him.”</p>
<p>Chewbacca didn’t want to be formally registered as a confidential 
informant with the city. He worked with Spalding and Echeverria on the 
strength of their personal relationships. “Chewbacca trusted us,” said 
Spalding. Their relationship was one of reciprocity. They helped him out
 with his needs; he gave them information. They didn’t pay him in the 
conventional sense. Rather, they cared for him, providing him with food 
and clothing, a sleeping bag and blankets, soap and towels (to shower at
 the Park District), mouthwash and toilet paper, a bus pass, and so on.</p>
<p>Chewbacca calls Echeverria by his street name, Danny Boy, but he has his own name for Spalding.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to call you Blondie like the rest of them,” he told 
her early in their relationship. “I’m going to call you Smarty, because 
you’re the brains of the operation.”</p>

<p><span><span> A</span></span> fter intelligence that Spalding and 
Echeverria gathered at Ickes provided the basis for a major drug bust, 
their “pat on the back,” as Echeverria put it, was to be assigned to the
 narcotics division within the organized crime bureau.</p>
<p>Spalding worked undercover, making buys. Because she was known on the
 streets of the South Side, she worked the West Side. Echeverria did 
enforcement — surveillance, intelligence gathering, and debriefing of 
those arrested — working out of a satellite office maintained by the 
organized crime bureau in the 2nd District, which he shared with his 
immediate superior, Sgt. Roderick Watson. The point of such operations 
is to work up the food chain. If those at low levels cooperate and 
provide good information, prosecutors may agree to a reduced charge.</p>
<p>Watts had returned to the 2nd District after public housing south was
 disbanded, and his office was just down the hall from the organized 
crime office. According to Echeverria, Watts was on friendly terms with 
Watson. He would regularly stick his head in the office and inquire 
casually about what they were working on.</p>
<p>Prior to landing at the 2nd District, Echeverria hadn’t known Watts 
personally, but he was aware of the rumors and had heard his name on the
 street. Drug dealers he nabbed in public housing would say things like 
“Can we buy you lunch?” or “Can we bond out here?” Echeverria was 
initially confused. “Shut up! They’re not the crew,” he recalled one of 
the young men saying. “They ain’t like Watts.”</p>
<p>As he did debriefings, Echeverria heard more and more references to 
Watts. This was particularly true of those arrested at the Ida B. Wells 
development. They would say things like “Why are you messing with me, 
when your man Watts is out there running his game?”</p>
<p>Initially, Echeverria told me, he didn’t give much credence to these 
statements. Guys facing time can be inventive, he said, and they weren’t
 providing him with much in the way of specifics. It was after he 
encountered Bernard Brown, a drug dealer whose picture was posted in the
 office as one of the top targets in the district, that he began to take
 the stories about Watts more seriously. Several members of Brown’s crew
 had been arrested. Echeverria had been debriefing them, when he caught 
sight of Brown on the street and picked him up.</p>
<p>“He had this Afro with two pony tails,” recalled Echeverria. “He looked like a big black Mickey Mouse.”</p>
<p>Brown was sharp. He immediately recognized Echeverria and Spalding 
were not officers from the 2nd District because they had different 
radios.</p>
<p>“You’re the indictment police, aren’t you?” said Brown. Looking for 
some leverage to cut a deal for himself, he asked, “Do you guys know 
Watts?”</p>
<p>“That name rings out,” replied Echeverria. “What can you tell me?”</p>
<p>“He’s the motherfucker that be running the dope in the projects,” 
replied Brown. “Are you sure you’re the indictment police? Instead of 
fucking with us niggers, that’s who you should go indict.”</p>
<p>Brown provided enough concrete information that Echeverria could 
verify some of what he said with arrest reports and other police 
documents. He described a criminal enterprise in which Watts and several
 members of his team were systematically extorting money from drug 
dealers in public housing. The payoffs were known on the street as the 
“Watts tax.” If a dealer paid the tax, his operation was protected from 
police interference. Watts, according to Brown, was protecting dealers 
allied with him, while targeting the competition and redirecting seized 
drugs to his own dope lines.</p>
<p>“For me,” Echeverria recalled, “it was like Big Foot. I’ve always 
heard about the guy, but is he real? Then I go to the 2nd District, and 
there’s Big Foot standing in front of me. So I’m thinking, maybe there’s
 something to what I’ve been hearing.”</p>
<p>The suspect also described an operation in which Watts was extorting money from drug dealers and running his own dope lines.</p>
<p>Among the things he was hearing were rumors that Watts had been 
involved in the murder of Wilbert Moore — aka Big Shorty — a drug dealer
 who operated out of the Ida B. Wells development. On January 19, 2006, 
Moore had been shot down outside a barber shop at 43rd and Cottage 
Grove.</p>
<p>For Echeverria, “pieces of the puzzle were beginning to come 
together.” A turning point came when they brought in another “player” 
who started talking about Watts. “You’re going to lock me up for four 
bags, when your guy Watts is moving the dope. They run that shit.”</p>
<p>“This guy put it together for me,” Echeverria recalled. The suspect 
also described an operation in which Watts was extorting money from drug
 dealers and running his own dope lines. “This was no pizza fund,” said 
Echeverria. For a popular drug line sold at multiple sites, according to
 the arrestee, the Watts tax could be as high as $50,000 a week.</p>
<p>He also told essentially the same story about the fate of Big Shorty 
that Echeverria was hearing from other sources. In the course of 
interrogating him, Echeverria threw out various different names, 
including some phony ones, then asked him about Big Shorty.</p>
<p>“Why you asking me about a dead man?”</p>
<p>“What can you tell me?”</p>
<p>“Do you want the street version or the paper version? The street 
version is you all did it. Watts did it. The paper version is a beef 
inside the GDs.”</p>
<p>Echeverria was impressed. “You hear a lot of stuff,” he recalled, “guys just lying to live. Not this guy.”</p>
<p>He confronted a dilemma. How could he report what he was hearing 
without having the code of silence enforced against him for ratting on 
another officer? “If I put pen to paper on this, my career will be over,
 not Watts’s.”</p>
<p>He called Spalding. “What the fuck do I do with this?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Go get a supervisor and make him do his job,” she replied.</p>
<p>Ida B. Wells Homes, 2007.</p>
<p> Photo: David Schalliol</p>
<p><span><span> T</span></span> he plan was to create a situation in 
which the supervisor would have to file a report. Procedure would be 
followed, the allegations would be reported, but it wouldn’t come back 
to Echeverria.</p>
<p>He requested that Sgt. Watson come to the room where the suspect was 
being held. He used a pretext. “He’s asking for a white shirt,” he told 
Watson. “He’s got something to say.”</p>
<p>Watson entered the room and went to undo the man’s handcuffs. While 
his back was turned, Echeverria made hand gestures to prompt him to talk
 about Watts. The man launched into a riff about Watts, reiterating to 
Watson what he had told Echeverria.</p>
<p>“We’re not trying to hear that shit,” said Watson.</p>
<p>Afterward, Echeverria asked Watson, “Hey, Sarge, how do you want me to handle that information he gave us in the report?”</p>
<p>“Make that shit a negative,” said Watson.</p>
<p>Echeverria entertained the possibility that Watson would follow 
procedure and open a confidential complaint register, or CR. Had he done
 so, Echeverria would have been contacted by investigators, but the call
 never came.</p>
<p>One day, while he was typing up a report, Echeverria recalled, he 
heard the name “Watts” and tuned into a conversation several detectives 
were having about Watts’s possible involvement in the killing of Big 
Shorty. He was struck by the tenor of the conversation. The detectives 
seemed resigned that the department would not pursue the matter.</p>
<p>Spalding had also heard details about the Big Shorty homicide from a 
CPD officer detailed to work with the Drug Enforcement Administration, 
with whom she occasionally exchanged information on an informal basis. 
The officer told her that the DEA had Big Shorty on a homicide charge. 
He had offered up Watts and was in the process of proffering when he was
 killed. (A 2005 <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3119150-ATF-Interview-With-Wilbert-Moore.html">report</a>
 on an interview with Wilbert Moore conducted by the DEA, CPD, and 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, which recently 
became public in the case of a man who claims to have been framed by 
Watts and his team, establishes that Moore was cooperating with federal 
law enforcement and was providing information about Watts.) </p>
<p>Spalding didn’t know whether the stories about Watts were true — “I 
didn’t want them to be” — but she was losing her confidence that serious
 allegations of misconduct were being investigated by the department. 
“I’m getting more and more confused,” Spalding recalled feeling at the 
time. “How could these high officials not be doing their jobs? Did I 
take a different oath?”</p>
<p>While Spalding and Echeverria didn’t have definitive proof that Watts
 and members of his team had committed crimes, they were convinced there
 was sufficient evidence to warrant an investigation. And they felt 
obligated to do something.</p>
<p>They decided to go to the FBI. Once they provided their information, 
they assumed that would be the end of their involvement. Contacting the 
FBI, however, would prove to be less an end than a beginning. It would 
alter the trajectory of their lives and set in motion a sequence of 
events now moving inexorably toward a full public reckoning in Chicago 
with the nature and consequences of the code of silence within the CPD.</p>
