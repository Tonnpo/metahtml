<p>“Morning dawns at length in Africa. The night has been long and dark.
 The opening day has a hopeful outlook and also an aspect of 
uncertainty. ... For many years little colonies, trading-posts, and 
slave-marts have fringed its borders; but the vast interior has remained
 a blank.” — Historical Sketch of the Missions of the American Board in 
Africa, Samuel Bartlett (1880)</p>
<p><span>E</span>RADICATING BLANK SPACES on maps of the “dark continent”
 was an obsession of Western powers during the 19th-century scramble for
 Africa. Today, a new scramble is underway to eradicate a different set 
of blank spots. The U.S. military has, since 9/11, engaged in a largely 
covert effort to extend its footprint across the continent with a 
network of mostly small and mostly low-profile camps. Some serve as <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/africa/staging-sites-enable-africom-to-reach-hot-spots-within-4-hours-leader-says-1.345120">staging areas</a>
 for quick-reaction forces or bare-boned outposts where special ops 
teams can advise local proxies; some can accommodate large cargo planes,
 others only small surveillance aircraft. All have one mission in 
common: to eradicate what the military calls the “<a href="https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/firing-blind/">tyranny of distance</a>.”
 These facilities allow U.S. forces to surveil and operate on larger and
 larger swaths of the continent — and, increasingly, to strike targets 
with drones and manned aircraft.</p>
<p><a href="file:///document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-5-13/#page-3"><span>Document</span> TF 48-4 Focus and Organization</a> According to an internal 2013 <a href="file:///document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-5-13">Pentagon study</a>
 obtained by The Intercept on secret drone operations in Somalia and 
Yemen between January 2011 and summer 2012, a secretive unit known as 
Task Force 48-4 carried out a shadow war in the region. The task force, 
with its headquarters at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, operated from 
outposts in Nairobi, Kenya, and Sanaa, Yemen. The aircraft it used — 
manned and remotely piloted — were based out of airfields in Djibouti, 
Ethiopia, and Kenya, as well as ships off the coast of East Africa.</p>
<p>U.S. Africa Command — the umbrella organization for U.S. military 
activities on the continent, known as Africom — insists that it 
maintains only a “<a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/us-military-pays-close-attention-to-boko-haram-militants/1681488.html">small footprint</a>” in Africa and claims that Camp Lemonnier, a former <a href="http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=62927">French Foreign Legion</a>
 outpost, is its only full-fledged base. However, a number of new 
facilities have been opened in recent years, and even Defense Secretary 
Ashton Carter has acknowledged that Lemonnier serves as “a hub with lots
 of spokes out there on the continent and in the region.”</p>

<p>One of those spokes can be found just 10 kilometers southwest of Camp Lemonnier. After numerous <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/us-moves-drones-from-key-africa-base/1756946.html">mishaps</a> and crashes, drone operations were moved from the camp to the more <a href="http://somturk.com.tr/djibouti-craft-apron-parking-area-construction-logistics">remote</a> <a href="http://archive.defensenews.com/article/20130925/DEFREG02/309250035/US-Relocates-Drones-Airfield-After-Djibouti-Crashes">Chabelley Airfield</a> in September 2013. Predator drones have also been based in the cities of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-set-to-open-second-drone-base-in-niger-as-it-expands-operations-in-africa/2014/08/31/365489c4-2eb8-11e4-994d-202962a9150c_story.html">Niamey</a> in Niger and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/opinion/dealing-with-boko-haram.html">N’Djamena</a> in Chad, while Reaper drones have been <a href="http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111904106704576583012923076634?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424053111904106704576583012923076634.html">flown</a>
 out of Seychelles International Airport. The Pentagon study, conducted 
by the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Task Force, also 
notes that, as of June 2012, there were two contractor-operated drones, 
one Predator and one Reaper, flying out of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-drone-base-in-ethiopia-is-operational/2011/10/27/gIQAznKwMM_story.html">Arba Minch</a>, Ethiopia. Off the coast of East Africa, a detachment equipped to dispatch a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/us/simple-scaneagle-drones-a-boost-for-us-military.html?_r=0">Scan Eagle</a>, a low-cost, low-tech drone used by the Navy, or an <a href="http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=8250AFBA-DF2B-4999-9EF3-0B0E46144D03">MQ-8 Fire Scout</a>,
 a remotely piloted helicopter, added to the regional array of 
surveillance assets, as did those associated with “Armada Sweep,” a 
ship-based system for collecting electronic communications. 
Additionally, two manned fixed-wing aircraft were based in Manda Bay, 
Kenya. Recent reports also indicate that the military’s Joint Special 
Operations Command, or JSOC, is now working out of two bases in <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/02/exclusive-u-s-operates-drones-from-secret-bases-in-somalia-special-operations-jsoc-black-hawk-down/">Somalia</a> — one in Kismayo, the other in Baledogle.</p>
<p>While generally austere, many of these bases — including the airfields in <a href="https://cryptome.org/2014-info/chabelly/chabelly-drone-base.htm">Chabelley</a> and <a href="http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/united-states-using-local-soldiers-fight-al-qaida-allies-east-africa/">Manda Bay</a>
 — have expanded in recent years, with more on the way. Last year, for 
example, Capt. Rick Cook, who at the time was chief of Africom’s 
engineer division, <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175830/tomgram%3A_nick_turse%2C_africom_becomes_a_%22war-fighting_combatant_command%22">mentioned</a>
 the potential for a “base-like facility” that would be “semi-permanent”
 and “capable of air operations” in Niger. The National Defense 
Authorization Act for fiscal year 2016, <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d114:H.R.1735:">introduced</a> in April, <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;sid=cp114llNjh&amp;r_n=hr102.114&amp;dbname=cp114&amp;&amp;sel=TOC_1188734&amp;">requests</a> $50 million for construction of an “Airfield and Base Camp at Agadez, Niger … to support operations in western Africa.”</p>
<p>Since 9/11, a multitude of other facilities — including staging 
areas, cooperative security locations and forward operating locations — 
have also popped up (or been beefed up) in Burkina Faso, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-setting-up-drone-base-in-africa-to-track-boko-haram-fighters/2015/10/14/0cbfac94-7299-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html">Cameroon</a>, Central African Republic, <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/africa/staging-sites-enable-africom-to-reach-hot-spots-within-4-hours-leader-says-1.345120">Gabon</a>, <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/africa/staging-sites-enable-africom-to-reach-hot-spots-within-4-hours-leader-says-1.345120">Ghana</a>,
 Kenya, Mali, Senegal, South Sudan, and Uganda. A 2011 report by Lauren 
Ploch, an analyst in African affairs with the Congressional Research 
Service, also mentioned U.S. military access to locations in Botswana, 
Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, Tunisia, and Zambia. 
According to Sam Cooks, a liaison officer with the Defense Logistics 
Agency, the U.S. military has <a href="http://www.dla.mil/Loglines/Pages/LoglinesJF2013Story06.aspx">struck</a>
 29 agreements to use international airports in Africa as refueling 
centers. These locations are only some of the nodes in a growing network
 of outposts facilitating an increasing number of missions by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/magazine/can-general-linders-special-operations-forces-stop-the-next-terrorist-threat.html">5,000 to 8,000</a> U.S. troops and civilians who annually operate on the continent.</p>
<p>Africom and the Pentagon jealously guard information about their 
outposts in Africa, making it impossible to ascertain even basic facts —
 like a simple count — let alone just how many are integral to JSOC 
operations, drone strikes, and other secret activities. “Due to 
operational security, I won’t be able to give you the exact size and 
number,” Lt. Cmdr. Anthony Falvo, an Africom spokesperson, told The 
Intercept by email. “What I can tell you is that our strategic posture 
and presence are premised on the concept of a tailored, flexible, light 
footprint that leverages and supports the posture and presence of 
partners and is supported by expeditionary infrastructure.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Illustration: The Intercept</p>
<p>If you search Africom’s website for news about Camp Lemonnier, you’ll find myriad feel-good stories about <a href="http://www.africom.mil/newsroom/article/10020/camp-lemonnier-goes-green-installs-solar-panels-to">green energy</a> initiatives, the <a href="http://www.africom.mil/newsroom/article/8871/us-army-national-guard-conducts-water-drilling-tes">drilling</a> of water wells, and a <a href="http://www.africom.mil/newsroom/article/8940/toby-keith-visits-camp-lemonnier">visit</a>
 by country music star Toby Keith. But that’s far from the whole story. 
The base is a lynchpin for U.S. military action in Africa.</p>
<p>“Camp Lemonnier is … an essential regional power projection base that
 enables the operations of multiple combatant commands,” said Gen. 
Carter Ham in 2012, then the commander of Africom, in a <a href="http://www.africom.mil/newsroom/article/8832/2012-posture-statement-statement-of-general-carter">statement</a>
 to the House Armed Services Committee. “The requirements for Camp 
Lemonnier as a key location for national security and power projection 
are enduring.”</p>
<p>A map in the Pentagon report indicates that there were 10 MQ-1 
Predator drones and four larger, more far-ranging MQ-9 Reapers based at 
Camp Lemonnier in June 2012. There were also six <a href="http://www.hurlburt.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/136/Article/204913/four-hurlburt-airmen-die-in-u-28a-crash-in-djibouti.aspx">U-28As</a> — a single-engine aircraft that conducts surveillance for special operations forces — and two <a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/p3.html">P-3 Orions</a>,
 a four-engine turboprop aircraft originally developed for maritime 
patrols but since repurposed for use over African countries. The map 
also shows the presence of eight F-15E Strike Eagles, manned fighter 
jets that are much faster and more heavily armed than drones. By August 
2012, an average of 16 drones and four fighter jets were <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/remote-us-base-at-core-of-secret-operations/2012/10/25/a26a9392-197a-11e2-bd10-5ff056538b7c_story.html">taking off</a> or landing there each day.</p>
<p>Located on the edge of Djibouti-<a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/military-responds-to-air-safety-issues-in-djibouti-1.344317">Ambouli</a> International Airport, Camp Lemonnier is also the headquarters for Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (<a href="http://www.hoa.africom.mil/">CJTF-HOA</a>), which <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/military-responds-to-air-safety-issues-in-djibouti-1.344317">includes</a> soldiers, sailors, and airmen, some of them members of special operations forces. The camp — which also <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=128615">supports</a> U.S. Central Command (Centcom) — has seen the number of personnel stationed there jump around <a href="http://navymedicine.navylive.dodlive.mil/archives/8884">450 percent</a> <a href="http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=42401">since 2002</a>. The base has <a href="http://themilitaryengineer.com/index.php/contacts/2015-marketing-kit/item/352-documenting-utilities-in-djibouti">expanded</a>
 from 88 acres to nearly 600 acres and has seen more than $600 million 
already allocated or awarded for projects such as aircraft parking 
aprons, taxiways, and a major <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175743/tomgram%3A_nick_turse,_africom's_gigantic_%22small_footprint%22">special operations compound</a>. In addition, $1.2 billion in construction and improvements has already been <a href="http://themilitaryengineer.com/index.php/contacts/2015-marketing-kit/item/352-documenting-utilities-in-djibouti">planned</a> for the future.</p>
<p>As it grew, Camp Lemonnier became one of the most critical bases not only for America’s drone assassination campaign in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/remote-us-base-at-core-of-secret-operations/2012/10/25/a26a9392-197a-11e2-bd10-5ff056538b7c_story.html">Somalia</a> and <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/dangerous-us-game-yemen/">Yemen</a>
 but also for U.S. military operations across the region. The camp is so
 crucial to long-term military plans that last year the U.S. inked a 
deal securing its lease until 2044, agreeing to hand over <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/world/africa/djibouti-a-safe-harbour-in-the-troubled-horn-of-africa">$70 million</a> per year in rent — about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/remote-us-base-at-core-of-secret-operations/2012/10/25/a26a9392-197a-11e2-bd10-5ff056538b7c_story.html">double</a> what it previously paid to the government of Djibouti.</p>
