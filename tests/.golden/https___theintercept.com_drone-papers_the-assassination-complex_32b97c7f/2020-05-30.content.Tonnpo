<p>From his first days as commander in chief, the drone has been 
President Barack Obama’s weapon of choice, used by the military and the 
CIA to hunt down and kill the people his administration has deemed — 
through secretive processes, without indictment or trial — worthy of 
execution. There has been intense focus on the technology of remote 
killing, but that often serves as a surrogate for what should be a 
broader examination of the state’s power over life and death.</p>
<p><span>D</span>RONES ARE A TOOL, not a policy. The policy is 
assassination. While every president since Gerald Ford has upheld an 
executive order banning assassinations by U.S. personnel, Congress has 
avoided legislating the issue or even <a href="http://fas.org/irp/crs/RS21037.pdf">defining</a>
 the word “assassination.” This has allowed proponents of the drone wars
 to rebrand assassinations with more palatable characterizations, such 
as the term du jour, “targeted killings.”</p>
<p>When the Obama administration has discussed drone strikes publicly, 
it has offered assurances that such operations are a more precise 
alternative to boots on the ground and are authorized only when an 
“imminent” threat is present and there is “near certainty” that the 
intended target will be eliminated. Those terms, however, appear to have
 been bluntly <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2013/02/drones_law_and_imminent_attacks_how_the_u_s_redefines_legal_terms_to_justify.html">redefined</a> to bear almost no resemblance to their commonly understood meanings.</p>
<p>The first drone strike outside of a declared war zone was conducted more than <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2402479.stm">12 years ago</a>, yet it was not until May 2013 that the White House released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/2013.05.23_fact_sheet_on_ppg.pdf">set of standards and procedures</a>
 for conducting such strikes. Those guidelines offered little 
specificity, asserting that the U.S. would only conduct a lethal strike 
outside of an “area of active hostilities” if a target represents a 
“continuing, imminent threat to U.S. persons,” without providing any 
sense of the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-comment-presidents-national-security-speech">internal process</a>
 used to determine whether a suspect should be killed without being 
indicted or tried. The implicit message on drone strikes from the Obama 
administration has been one of trust, but don’t verify.</p>

 The Intercept has obtained a cache of secret slides that provides a 
window into the inner workings of the U.S. military’s kill/capture 
operations at a key time in the evolution of the drone wars — between 
2011 and 2013. The documents, which also outline the internal views of 
special operations forces on the shortcomings and flaws of the drone 
program, were provided by a source within the intelligence community who
 worked on the types of operations and programs described in the slides.
 The Intercept granted the source’s request for anonymity because the 
materials are classified and because the U.S. government has engaged in 
aggressive prosecution of whistleblowers. The stories in this series 
will refer to the source as “the source.”</p>
<p>The source said he decided to provide these documents to The 
Intercept because he believes the public has a right to understand the 
process by which people are placed on kill lists and ultimately 
assassinated on orders from the highest echelons of the U.S. government.
 “This outrageous explosion of watchlisting — of monitoring people and 
racking and stacking them on lists, assigning them numbers, assigning 
them ‘baseball cards,’ assigning them death sentences without notice, on
 a worldwide battlefield — it was, from the very first instance, wrong,”
 the source said.</p>
<p>“We’re allowing this to happen. And by ‘we,’ I mean every American 
citizen who has access to this information now, but continues to do 
nothing about it.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon, White House, and Special Operations Command all 
declined to comment. A Defense Department spokesperson said, “We don’t 
comment on the details of classified reports.”</p>
<p>The CIA and the U.S. military’s Joint Special Operations Command 
(JSOC) operate parallel drone-based assassination programs, and the 
secret documents should be viewed in the context of an intense <a href="file:///drone-papers/find-fix-finish/">internal turf war</a>
 over which entity should have supremacy in those operations. Two sets 
of slides focus on the military’s high-value targeting campaign in 
Somalia and Yemen as it existed between 2011 and 2013, specifically the 
operations of a secretive unit, Task Force 48-4.</p>
<p><a href="file:///document/2015/10/15/operation-haymaker/#page-1">Additional documents</a> on high-value kill/capture operations in Afghanistan buttress <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?_r=0">previous accounts</a>
 of how the Obama administration masks the true number of civilians 
killed in drone strikes by categorizing unidentified people killed in a 
strike as enemies, even if they were not the intended targets. The 
slides also <a href="file:///drone-papers/manhunting-in-the-hindu-kush">paint a picture</a>
 of a campaign in Afghanistan aimed not only at eliminating al Qaeda and
 Taliban operatives, but also at taking out members of other local armed
 groups.</p>
<p>One top-secret document shows how the terror “watchlist” appears in 
the terminals of personnel conducting drone operations, linking unique 
codes associated with cellphone SIM cards and handsets to specific 
individuals in order to geolocate them.</p>
<p>A top-secret document shows how the watchlist looks on internal systems used by drone operators.</p>
<p>The <a href="file:///drone-papers/firing-blind/">costs to intelligence</a>
 gathering when suspected terrorists are killed rather than captured are
 outlined in the slides pertaining to Yemen and Somalia, which are part 
of a 2013 study conducted by a Pentagon entity, the Intelligence, 
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Task Force. The ISR study lamented the 
limitations of the drone program, arguing for more advanced drones and 
other surveillance aircraft and the expanded use of naval vessels to 
extend the reach of surveillance operations necessary for targeted 
strikes. It also contemplated the establishment of new “politically 
challenging” airfields and recommended capturing and interrogating more 
suspected terrorists rather than killing them in drone strikes.</p>
<p>The ISR Task Force at the time was under the control of Michael 
Vickers, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence. Vickers, a 
fierce proponent of drone strikes and a legendary paramilitary figure, 
had long pushed for a significant increase in the military’s use of 
special operations forces. The ISR Task Force is <a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/ISRPerformanceAudit%20Final.pdf">viewed by key lawmakers</a> as an advocate for more surveillance platforms like drones.</p>
<p>The ISR study also reveals <a href="file:///drone-papers/the-life-and-death-of-objective-peckham/">new details</a>
 about the case of a British citizen, Bilal el-Berjawi, who was stripped
 of his citizenship before being killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2012. 
British and American intelligence had Berjawi under surveillance for 
several years as he traveled back and forth between the U.K. and East 
Africa, yet did not capture him. Instead, the U.S. hunted him down and <a href="file:///document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-2-13/#page-22">killed him in Somalia</a>.</p>
<p>Taken together, the secret documents lead to the conclusion that 
Washington’s 14-year high-value targeting campaign suffers from an 
overreliance on signals intelligence, an apparently incalculable 
civilian toll, and — due to a preference for assassination rather than 
capture — an inability to extract potentially valuable intelligence from
 terror suspects. They also highlight the futility of the war in 
Afghanistan by showing how the U.S. has poured vast resources into 
killing local insurgents, in the process exacerbating the very threat 
the U.S. is seeking to confront.</p>
<p><a href="file:///drone-papers/find-fix-finish"><span>Read more</span> Find, Fix, Finish</a>
 These secret slides help provide historical context to Washington’s 
ongoing wars, and are especially relevant today as the U.S. military <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-launches-secret-drone-campaign-to-hunt-islamic-state-leaders-in-syria/2015/09/01/723b3e04-5033-11e5-933e-7d06c647a395_story.html">intensifies</a>
 its drone strikes and covert actions against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. 
Those campaigns, like the ones detailed in these documents, are 
unconventional wars that employ special operations forces at the tip of 
the spear.</p>
<p>The “find, fix, finish” doctrine that has fueled America’s post-9/11 
borderless war is being refined and institutionalized. Whether through 
the use of drones, night raids, or new platforms yet to be unleashed, 
these documents lay bare the normalization of assassination as a central
 component of U.S. counterterrorism policy.</p>
<p>“The military is easily capable of adapting to change, but they don’t
 like to stop anything they feel is making their lives easier, or is to 
their benefit. And this certainly is, in their eyes, a very quick, clean
 way of doing things. It’s a very slick, efficient way to conduct the 
war, without having to have the massive ground invasion mistakes of Iraq
 and Afghanistan,” the source said. “But at this point, they have become
 so addicted to this machine, to this way of doing business, that it 
seems like it’s going to become harder and harder to pull them away from
 it the longer they’re allowed to continue operating in this way.”</p>
<p>The articles in The Drone Papers were produced by a team of reporters
 and researchers from The Intercept that has spent months analyzing the 
documents. The series is intended to serve as a long-overdue public 
examination of the methods and outcomes of America’s assassination 
program. This campaign, carried out by two presidents through four 
presidential terms, has been shrouded in excessive secrecy. The public 
has a right to see these documents not only to engage in an informed 
debate about the future of U.S. wars, both overt and covert, but also to
 understand the circumstances under which the U.S. government arrogates 
to itself the right to sentence individuals to death without the 
established checks and balances of arrest, trial, and appeal.</p>
<p>Among the key revelations in this series:</p>
<h2>How the president authorizes targets for assassination</h2>
<p><a href="file:///drone-papers/the-kill-chain"><span>Read more</span> Kill Chain</a>It
 has been widely reported that President Obama directly approves 
high-value targets for inclusion on the kill list, but the secret ISR 
study provides new insight into the kill chain, including a detailed 
chart stretching from electronic and human intelligence gathering all 
the way to the president’s desk. The same month the ISR study was 
circulated — May 2013 — Obama signed the policy guidance on the use of 
force in counterterrorism operations overseas. A senior administration 
official, who declined to comment on the classified documents, told The 
Intercept that “those guidelines remain in effect today.”</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence personnel collect information on potential targets, as The Intercept has <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/05/watch-commander/">previously reported</a>, drawn from <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/07/23/blacklisted/">government watchlists</a>
 and the work of intelligence, military, and law enforcement agencies. 
At the time of the study, when someone was destined for the kill list, 
intelligence analysts created a portrait of a suspect and the threat 
that person posed, pulling it together “in a condensed format known as a
 ‘baseball card.’” That information was then bundled with operational 
information and packaged in a “target information folder” to be “staffed
 up to higher echelons” for action. On average, it took 58 days for the 
president to sign off on a target, <a href="file:///document/2015/10/15/small-footprint-operations-2-13/#page-41">one slide</a>
 indicates. At that point, U.S. forces had 60 days to carry out the 
strike. The documents include two case studies that are partially based 
on information detailed on baseball cards.</p>
<p>The system for <a href="file:///document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-2-13/#page-23">creating baseball cards</a>
 and targeting packages, according to the source, depends largely on 
intelligence intercepts and a multi-layered system of fallible, human 
interpretation. “It isn’t a surefire method,” he said. “You’re relying 
on the fact that you do have all these very powerful machines, capable 
of collecting extraordinary amounts of data and information,” which can 
lead personnel involved in targeted killings to believe they have 
“godlike powers.”</p>
<h2>Assassinations depend on unreliable intelligence and hurt intelligence gathering</h2>
<p><a href="file:///drone-papers/firing-blind"><span>Read more</span> Firing Blind</a>In
 undeclared war zones, the U.S. military has become overly reliant on 
signals intelligence, or SIGINT, to identify and ultimately hunt down 
and kill people. The documents acknowledge that using metadata from 
phones and computers, as well as communications intercepts, is an 
inferior method of finding and finishing targeted people. They described
 SIGINT capabilities in these unconventional battlefields as “poor” and 
“limited.” Yet such collection, much of it provided by foreign partners,
 accounted for more than half the intelligence used to track potential 
kills in Yemen and Somalia. The ISR study characterized these failings 
as a technical hindrance to efficient operations, omitting the fact that
 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/world/asia/drone-strikes-reveal-uncomfortable-truth-us-is-often-unsure-about-who-will-die.html">faulty intelligence</a> has led to the killing of innocent people, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/american-italian-hostages-killed-in-cia-drone-strike-in-january-1429795801">including</a> U.S. citizens, in drone strikes.</p>
<p>The source underscored the unreliability of metadata, most often from
 phone and computer communications intercepts. These sources of 
information, identified by so-called selectors such as a phone number or
 email address, are the primary tools used by the military to find, fix,
 and finish its targets. “It requires an enormous amount of faith in the
 technology that you’re using,” the source said. “There’s countless 
instances where I’ve come across intelligence that was faulty.” This, he
 said, is a primary factor in the killing of civilians. “It’s stunning 
the number of instances when selectors are misattributed to certain 
people. And it isn’t until several months or years later that you all of
 a sudden realize that the entire time you thought you were going after 
this really hot target, you wind up realizing it was his mother’s phone 
the whole time.”</p>
<p>Within the special operations community, the source said, the 
internal view of the people being hunted by the U.S. for possible death 
by drone strike is: “They have no rights. They have no dignity. They 
have no humanity to themselves. They’re just a ‘selector’ to an analyst.
 You eventually get to a point in the target’s life cycle that you are 
following them, you don’t even refer to them by their actual name.” This
 practice, he said, contributes to “dehumanizing the people before 
you’ve even encountered the moral question of ‘is this a legitimate kill
 or not?’”</p>
<p>By the ISR study’s own admission, killing suspected terrorists, even 
if they are “legitimate” targets, further hampers intelligence 
gathering. The secret study states bluntly: “Kill operations 
significantly reduce the intelligence available.” A chart shows that 
special operations actions in the Horn of Africa resulted in captures 
just 25 percent of the time, indicating a heavy tilt toward lethal 
strikes.</p>
<h2>Strikes often kill many more than the intended target</h2>
<p><a href="file:///drone-papers/manhunting-in-the-hindu-kush"><span>Read more</span> Manhunting in the Hindu Kush</a>
 The White House and Pentagon boast that the targeted killing program is
 precise and that civilian deaths are minimal. However, documents 
detailing a special operations campaign in northeastern Afghanistan, 
Operation Haymaker, show that between January 2012 and February 2013, 
U.S. special operations airstrikes killed more than 200 people. Of 
those, only 35 were the intended targets. During one five-month period 
of the operation, according to the documents, nearly 90 percent of the 
people killed in airstrikes were not the intended targets. In Yemen and 
Somalia, where the U.S. has far more limited intelligence capabilities 
to confirm the people killed are the intended targets, the equivalent 
ratios may well be much worse.</p>
<p>“Anyone caught in the vicinity is guilty by association,” the source 
said. When “a drone strike kills more than one person, there is no 
guarantee that those persons deserved their fate. … So it’s a phenomenal
 gamble.”</p>
<h2>The military labels unknown people it kills as “enemies killed in action”</h2>
<p><a href="file:///drone-papers/manhunting-in-the-hindu-kush"><span>Read more</span> Manhunting in the Hindu Kush</a>
 The documents show that the military designated people it killed in 
targeted strikes as EKIA — “enemy killed in action” — even if they were 
not the intended targets of the strike. Unless evidence posthumously 
emerged to prove the males killed were not terrorists or “unlawful enemy
 combatants,” EKIA remained their designation, according to the source. 
That process, he said, “is insane. But we’ve made ourselves comfortable 
with that. The intelligence community, JSOC, the CIA, and everybody that
 helps support and prop up these programs, they’re comfortable with that
 idea.”</p>
<p>The source described official U.S. government statements minimizing 
the number of civilian casualties inflicted by drone strikes as 
“exaggerating at best, if not outright lies.”</p>
<h2>The number of people targeted for drone strikes and other finishing operations</h2>
<p><a href="file:///drone-papers/the-kill-chain"><span>Read more</span> Kill Chain</a>According to <a href="file:///document/2015/10/15/small-footprint-operations-5-13/#page-6">one secret slide</a>,
 as of June 2012, there were 16 people in Yemen whom President Obama had
 authorized U.S. special operations forces to assassinate. In Somalia, 
there were four. The statistics contained in the documents appear to 
refer only to targets approved under the 2001 Authorization for Use of 
Military Force, not CIA operations. In 2012 alone, according to data 
compiled by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, there were more than
 200 people killed in operations in Yemen and between four and eight in 
Somalia.</p>
<h2>How geography shapes the assassination campaign</h2>
<p><a href="file:///drone-papers/firing-blind"><span>Read more</span> Firing Blind</a>In
 Afghanistan and Iraq, the pace of U.S. strikes was much quicker than in
 Yemen and Somalia. This appears due, in large part, to the fact that 
Afghanistan and Iraq were declared war zones, and in Iraq the U.S. was 
able to launch attacks from bases closer to the targeted people. By 
contrast, in Somalia and Yemen, undeclared war zones where strikes were 
justified under tighter restrictions, U.S. attack planners described a 
serpentine bureaucracy for obtaining approval for assassination. The 
secret study states that the number of high-value targeting operations 
in these countries was “significantly lower than previously seen in Iraq
 and Afghanistan” because of these “constraining factors.”</p>
<p>Even after the president approved a target in Yemen or Somalia, the 
great distance between drone bases and targets created significant 
challenges for U.S. forces — a problem referred to in the documents as 
the “tyranny of distance.” In Iraq, more than 80 percent of “finishing 
operations” were conducted within 150 kilometers of an air base. In 
Yemen, the average distance was about 450 kilometers and in Somalia it 
was more than 1,000 kilometers. On average, one document states, it took
 the U.S. six years to develop a target in Somalia, but just 8.3 months 
to kill the target once the president had approved his addition to the 
kill list.</p>
<h2>Inconsistencies with White House statements about targeted killing</h2>
<p><a href="file:///drone-papers/the-kill-chain"><span>Read more</span> Kill Chain</a>The
 White House’s publicly available policy standards state that lethal 
force will be launched only against targets who pose a “continuing, 
imminent threat to U.S. persons.” In the documents, however, there is 
only one <a href="file:///document/2015/10/15/small-footprint-operations-5-13/#page-6">explicit mention</a>
 of a specific criterion: that a person “presents a threat to U.S. 
interest or personnel.” While such a rationale may make sense in the 
context of a declared war in which U.S. personnel are on the ground in 
large numbers, such as in Afghanistan, that standard is so vague as to 
be virtually meaningless in countries like Yemen and Somalia, where very
 few U.S. personnel operate.</p>
<p>While many of the documents provided to The Intercept contain 
explicit internal recommendations for improving unconventional U.S. 
warfare, the source said that what’s implicit is even more significant. 
The mentality reflected in the documents on the assassination programs 
is: “This process can work. We can work out the kinks. We can excuse the
 mistakes. And eventually we will get it down to the point where we 
don’t have to continuously come back … and explain why a bunch of 
innocent people got killed.”</p>
<p>The architects of what amounts to a global assassination campaign do 
not appear concerned with either its enduring impact or its moral 
implications. “All you have to do is take a look at the world and what 
it’s become, and the ineptitude of our Congress, the power grab of the 
executive branch over the past decade,” the source said. “It’s never 
considered: Is what we’re doing going to ensure the safety of our moral 
integrity? Of not just our moral integrity, but the lives and humanity 
of the people that are going to have to live with this the most?”</p>
