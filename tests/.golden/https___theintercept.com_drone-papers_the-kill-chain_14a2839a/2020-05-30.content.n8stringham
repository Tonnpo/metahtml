<p>Secret military documents obtained by The Intercept offer rare 
documentary evidence of the process by which the Obama administration 
creates and acts on its kill list of terror suspects in Yemen and 
Somalia. The documents offer an unusual glimpse into the decision-making
 process behind the drone strikes and other operations of the largely 
covert war, outlining the selection and vetting of targets through the 
ranks of the military and the White House, culminating in the 
president’s approval of a 60-day window for lethal action.</p>
<p><span>T</span>HE DOCUMENTS COME FROM <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-5-13/#page-6">a Pentagon study</a>,
 circulated in early 2013, evaluating the intelligence and surveillance 
technology behind the military’s Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC)
 killing campaign in Yemen and Somalia in 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>The study, carried out by the Pentagon’s Intelligence, Surveillance, 
and Reconnaissance Task Force, illuminates and in some cases contradicts
 the administration’s public description of a campaign directed at 
high-level terrorists who pose an imminent threat to the United States. 
It admits frankly that capturing terrorists is a rare occurrence and 
hints at the use of so-called signature strikes against unknown 
individuals exhibiting suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>The Intercept obtained two versions of the study, a <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-2-13/">longer presentation</a> dated February 2013, and an <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-5-13">executive summary</a> from May 2013, which includes a slide showing the chain of command leading to the approval of a lethal strike.</p>
<p>A slide from a May 2013 Pentagon presentation shows the chain of 
command for ordering drone strikes and other operations carried out by 
JSOC in Yemen and Somalia.</p>
<p> GCC = Geographic Combatant Command; SECDEF = Secretary of Defense; 
PDC/PC = Principals’ Deputies Committee/Principals Committee; CoM = 
Chief of Mission; CoS = Chief of Station</p>
<p>The Obama administration has been loath to declassify even the legal 
rationale for drone strikes — let alone detail the bureaucratic 
structure revealed in these documents. Both the CIA and JSOC conduct 
drone strikes in Yemen, and very little has been officially disclosed 
about either the military’s or the spy agency’s operations.</p>
<p>“The public has a right to know who’s making these decisions, who 
decides who is a legitimate target, and on what basis that decision is 
made,” said Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the American Civil 
Liberties Union.</p>
<p>Both the Pentagon and the National Security Council declined to 
respond to detailed questions about the study and about the drone 
program more generally. The NSC would not say if the process for 
approving targets or strikes had changed since the study was produced.</p>
<h2>Two Steps to a Kill</h2>
<p>The May 2013 <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-5-13/#page-6">slide</a>
 describes a two-part process of approval for an attack: step one, 
“‘Developing a target’ to ‘Authorization of a target,’” and step two, 
“‘Authorizing’ to ‘Actioning.’” According to the slide, intelligence 
personnel from JSOC’s Task Force 48-4, working alongside other 
intelligence agencies, would build the case for action against an 
individual, eventually generating a “baseball card” on the target, which
 was “staffed up to higher echelons — ultimately to the president.”</p>
<p>The intelligence package on the person being targeted passed from the
 JSOC task force tracking him to the command in charge of the region — 
Centcom for Yemen, and Africom for Somalia — and then to the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, followed by the secretary of defense. It was then 
examined by a circle of top advisers known as the Principals Committee 
of the National Security Council, and their seconds in command, known 
collectively as the Deputies Committee.</p>
<p>The slide detailing the kill chain indicates that while Obama 
approved each target, he did not approve each individual strike, 
although news accounts have previously reported that the president <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?_r=0">personally</a> “signs off” on strikes outside of Afghanistan or Pakistan. However, the slide does appear to be consistent with Obama’s <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/09/06/obamas-five-rules-for-covert-drone-strikes/">comment</a> in 2012 that “ultimately I’m responsible for the process.”</p>

<p>There have been various accounts of this drone bureaucracy, and 
almost all stress the role of Obama’s influential counterterrorism 
adviser John Brennan (who became director of the CIA in 2013) and of top
 administration lawyers in deciding who could be killed. Under Brennan, 
the nominations process was reportedly concentrated in the White House, <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/content/who-will-drones-target-who-us-will-decide">replacing</a> video conferences once run by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/plan-for-hunting-terrorists-signals-us-intends-to-keep-adding-names-to-kill-lists/2012/10/23/4789b2ae-18b3-11e2-a55c-39408fbe6a4b_story.html">elevating</a> the role of the National Counterterrorism Center in organizing intelligence. Later in 2013, the White House <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/why-white-house-blessed-recent-yemen-drone-strikes-f6C10936036">reportedly</a> tightened control over individual strikes in Yemen.</p>
<p>At the time of the study, with the president’s approval, JSOC had a 
60-day window to hit a target. For the actual strike, the task force 
needed approval from the Geographic Combatant Command as well as the 
ambassador and CIA station chief in the country where the target was 
located. For a very important target, such as al Qaeda-linked preacher 
Anwar al Awlaki, who was a U.S. citizen, “it would take a high-level 
official to approve the strike,” said Lt. Col. Mark McCurley, a former 
drone pilot who worked on operations in Yemen and recently published a <a href="http://www.penguin.com/book/hunter-killer-by-t-mark-mccurley-kevin-maurer/9780525954439">book about his experiences</a>.
 “And that includes a lot of lawyers and a lot of review at different 
levels to reach that decision. We have an extensive chain of command, 
humans along the whole link that monitor the entire process from start 
to finish on an airstrike.” The country’s government was also supposed 
to sign off. “One Disagrees = STOP,” the slide notes, with a tiny red 
stop sign.</p>
<p>In practice, the degree of cooperation with the host nation has 
varied. Somalia’s minister of national security, Abdirizak Omar Mohamed,
 told The Intercept that the United States alerted Somalia’s president 
and foreign minister of strikes “sometimes ahead of time, sometimes 
during the operation … normally we get advance notice.” He said he was 
unaware of an instance where Somali officials had objected to a strike, 
but added that if they did, he assumed the U.S. would respect Somalia’s 
sovereignty.</p>
<p>By 2011, when the study’s time frame began, Yemen’s president Ali 
Abdullah Saleh was in crisis. Facing domestic protests during the Arab 
Spring, he left the country in June 2011 after being injured in a 
bombing. Both the CIA and JSOC stepped up their drone campaigns, which 
enjoyed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/29/world/middleeast/yemens-leader-president-hadi-praises-us-drone-strikes.html">vocal support</a> from Saleh’s eventual successor, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi.</p>
<p>“It was almost never coordinated with Saleh. Once Hadi became 
president, March 2012, there was a big chance we’d be in the loop” 
before drone strikes were conducted, said a former senior Yemeni 
official who worked for both the Saleh and Hadi governments.</p>
<p>Today, with Yemen’s capital under the control of the Houthi rebel 
group and undergoing bombardment by Saudi Arabia, administration lawyers
 <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-yemen-houthis-20150206-story.html">do not seem worried</a> about asking permission to carry out drone strikes amid the fray.</p>
<p>“Now, I think they don’t even bother telling anyone. There is really 
no one in charge to tell,” said the former Yemeni official, who 
requested anonymity citing current unrest and the fact that he no longer
 works for the government.</p>
<h2>Who Can Be Targeted</h2>
<p>Both the Bush and Obama administrations have maintained that the 2001
 Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF, permits the pursuit 
of members of al Qaeda and its affiliates wherever they may be located.</p>
<p>The Pentagon study refers throughout to operations that fall under 
AUMF. But it also underlines how the targeted killing campaigns differ 
from traditional battlefields, <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-2-13/#page-6">noting</a> that the region is located “Outside a Defined Theater of Active Armed Conflict,” which limits “allowable U.S. activities.”</p>
<p>Obama administration officials <a href="https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/425630-crs-targeted-killing#document/p12/a71709">have said</a>
 that in addition to being a member of al Qaeda or an associated force, 
targets must also pose a significant threat to the United States. In May
 2013, facing increasing pressure to fully admit the existence of the 
drone war and especially to address allegations of civilian harm, the 
White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/fact-sheet-us-policy-standards-and-procedures-use-force-counterterrorism">released</a> policy guidelines for lethal counterterrorism operations that seemed to further restrict them. In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-national-defense-university">speech</a>,
 Obama announced that action would be taken only against people who 
posed a “continuing, imminent threat to the American people,” and who 
could not be captured. A strike would only occur with “near certainty” 
that no civilians would be killed or injured.</p>
<p>Even with the new guidelines, <a href="http://opiniojuris.org/2011/05/21/no-the-un-has-not-affirmed-that-the-us-is-engaged-in-an-armed-conflict-with-al-qaeda/">legal observers</a>, particularly <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/07/31/us-reassess-war-model-against-al-qaeda">human rights lawyers</a>,
 have disputed the Obama administration’s position that the U.S., in 
strict legal terms, is in an armed conflict with al Qaeda in Yemen or 
Somalia — and therefore dispute what standards should apply to strikes. 
Others question the extent to which the hundreds of people killed in 
drone strikes in those countries meet the supposedly strict criteria.</p>
<p>“I think there can be questions raised about how stringently some of 
the requirements are being applied,” said Jennifer Daskal, an assistant 
professor of law at American University who worked for the Department of
 Justice from 2009 to 2011. “Near certainty of no civilian deaths, is 
that really imposed? What does it mean for capture not to be feasible? 
How hard do you have to try?”</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the study reflects the May policy guidance, 
since it does not give an extensive description of the criteria for 
approving a target, noting only that the target must be “a threat to 
U.S. interest or personnel.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the National Security Council would not explain 
why the standards in the study differed from the guidelines laid out in 
May 2013, but emphasized that “those guidelines remain in effect today.”</p>
<p>The two-month window for striking, says Hina Shamsi, director of the 
ACLU’s National Security Project, shows the administration’s broad 
interpretation of “a continuing, imminent threat.”</p>
<p>“If you have approval over a monthslong period, that sends the signal
 of a presumption that someone is always targetable, regardless of 
whether they are actually participating in hostilities,” said Shamsi.</p>
<p>The slide illustrating the chain of approval makes no mention of 
evaluating options for capture. It may be implied that those discussions
 are part of the target development process, but the omission reflects 
the brute facts beneath the Obama administration’s stated preference for
 capture: Detention of marked targets is incredibly rare.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-5-13/#page-9">chart</a>
 in the study shows that in 2011 and 2012, captures accounted for only 
25 percent of operations carried out in the Horn of Africa — and all 
were apparently by foreign forces. In one of the few publicized captures
 of the Obama presidency, al Shabaab commander Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame 
was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/national-security/us-indicts-somali-on-terrorism-charges/2011/07/05/gHQA8bbfzH_story.html">picked up in April 2011</a>
 by U.S. forces in the Gulf of Aden and brought to Manhattan for trial, 
though he may not be reflected in the study’s figures because he was 
apprehended at sea.</p>
<p>The Pentagon study recommended more captures, rather than killings, 
because of the intelligence that could be gleaned from interrogations 
and collected materials.</p>
<p> EKIA = Enemy Killed in Action; HOA = Horn of Africa</p>
<p>The study does not contain an overall count of strikes or deaths, but
 it does note that “relatively few high-level terrorists meet criteria 
for targeting” and states that at the end of June 2012, there were 16 
authorized targets in Yemen and only four in Somalia.</p>
<p>Despite the small number of people on the kill list, in 2011 and 2012
 there were at least 54 U.S. drone strikes and other attacks reported in
 Yemen, killing a minimum of 293 people, including 55 civilians, 
according to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lb1hEYJ_omI8lSe33izwS2a2lbiygs0hTp2Al_Kz5KQ/edit?pli=1#gid=977256262">figures compiled</a> by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. In Somalia, there were at least three attacks, <a href="file:///drone-papers/the-life-and-death-of-objective-peckham/">resulting in the deaths of at minimum six people</a>.</p>
<p>Some of those Yemen strikes were likely carried out by the CIA, which since mid-2011 has flown drones to Yemen from a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/brennan-nomination-opens-obama-to-criticism-on-secret-targeted-killings/2013/02/05/8f3c94f0-6fb0-11e2-8b8d-e0b59a1b8e2a_story_1.html">base in Saudi Arabia</a> and reportedly has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/world/middleeast/with-brennan-pick-a-light-on-drone-strikes-hazards.html?hp&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1">its own kill list and rules</a>
 for strikes. Yet it is also clear that the military sometimes harmed 
multiple other people in trying to kill one of those high-level targets.
 The study includes a <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-2-13/#page-23">description</a>
 of the hunt for an alleged al Qaeda member referred to as “Objective 
Rhodes” or “Anjaf,” who is likely Fahd Saleh al-Anjaf al-Harithi, who 
was reported killed in July 2012, on the same day as Objective Rhodes. A
 failed strike on Harithi that April killed two “enemies.” News accounts
 at the time <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/04/23/uk-saudi-yemen-kidnappers-idUKBRE83M15O20120423">reported</a> three “militants” had died.</p>
<p>A slide from February 2013 recounts the hunt for an alleged al Qaeda 
member (likely Fahd Saleh al-Anjaf al-Harithi) showing that two others 
died in a botched attempt to kill him.</p>
<p>The large number of reported strikes may also be a reflection of 
signature strikes in Yemen, where people can be targeted based on 
patterns of suspect behavior. In 2012, administration officials <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-approves-broader-yemen-drone-campaign/2012/04/25/gIQA82U6hT_story.html">said</a> that President Obama had approved strikes in Yemen on unknown people, <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/drones-silent-killers-64909">calling them TADS,</a>
 or “terror attack disruption strikes,” and claiming that they were more
 constrained than the CIA’s signature strikes in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The study <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-2-13/#page-30">refers</a>
 to using drones and spy planes to “conduct TADS related network 
development,” presumably a reference to surveilling behavior patterns 
and relationships in order to carry out signature strikes. It is unclear
 what authorities govern such strikes, which undermine the 
administration’s insistence that the U.S. kills mainly “high-value” 
targets.</p>
<h2>Near Certainty</h2>
<p>According to the White House guidelines released in May 2013, the 
decision to take a strike should be based on thorough surveillance and 
only occur in the absence of civilians. A strike requires “near 
certainty that the terrorist target is present” and “near certainty that
 non-combatants will not be injured or killed.”</p>
<p>The study describes the rules for a strike slightly differently, 
stating that there must be a “low CDE [collateral damage environment]” —
 meaning a low estimate of how many innocent people might be harmed. It 
also states there must be “near certainty” that the target is present, 
“based on two forms of intelligence,” with “no contradictory 
intelligence.” In contrast to the White House statement, the “near 
certainty” standard is not applied to civilians.</p>
<p>The study <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-2-13/#page-13">cites</a>
 the “need to avoiding [sic] collateral damage areas” as a reason for 
“unsuccessful” missions, but it does not give numbers of civilian 
casualties or examples of bad intelligence leading to a mistaken kill.</p>
<p>Since the first drone strike in Yemen in 2002, hundreds of people 
have been killed in U.S. operations in Yemen and Somalia, many of them 
innocent civilians. The tallies shown here were compiled by the <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/08/10/pakistan-drone-strikes-the-methodology2/#sources">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>
 from reports of both CIA and JSOC drone strikes and other operations. 
The large range in the estimates is due to the inherent difficulties of 
collecting data on airstrikes in war zones. The identities of the 
“people killed” were often unknown and may include civilians as well as 
suspected terrorists or militants. The U.S. almost never publicly 
acknowledges individual operations.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Graphic: The Intercept</p>
<p>Yet the overall conclusion is that getting accurate positive identification is a <a href="file:///drone-papers/firing-blind/">“critical” issue for the drone program</a>
 in the region, due to limitations in technology and the number of spy 
aircraft available. The military relies heavily on signals intelligence —
 drawn from electronic communications — and much of it comes from 
foreign governments, who may have their own agendas.</p>
<p>Identifying the correct target relates directly to the issue of 
civilian casualties: If you don’t have certainty about your target, it 
follows that you may well be killing innocent people. In Iraq and 
Afghanistan, “when collateral damage did occur, 70 percent of the time 
it was attributable to failed — that is, mistaken — identification,” 
according to a <a href="http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/2014/03/McNeal-TargetedKilling.pdf">paper</a> by Gregory McNeal, an expert on drones and security at Pepperdine School of Law.</p>
<p>Another factor is timing: If the 60-day authorization expired, 
analysts would have to start all over in building the intelligence case 
against the target, said a former senior special operations officer, who
 asked not to be identified because he was discussing classified 
materials. That could lead to pressure to take a shot while the window 
was open.</p>
<p>During the time of the study, there were multiple well-reported, 
high-profile incidents in which reported JSOC strikes killed the wrong 
people. Perhaps most famously, in October 2011, a 16-year-old U.S. 
citizen named Abdulrahman Awlaki, the son of Anwar al Awlaki, died in a 
JSOC strike while eating dinner with his cousins, two weeks after his 
father was killed by a CIA drone. In press accounts, one anonymous 
official <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-veteran-john-brennan-has-transformed-us-counterterrorism-policy/2012/10/24/318b8eec-1c7c-11e2-ad90-ba5920e56eb3_story_4.html">called</a>
 Abdulrahman’s death “an outrageous mistake,” while others said he was 
with people believed to be members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
 Publicly, the government has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/23/us/politics/23holder-drone-lettter.html">said</a> only that he “was not specifically targeted.”</p>
<p>A September 2012 strike in Yemen, extensively investigated by <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2013/10/22/between-drone-and-al-qaeda/civilian-cost-us-targeted-killings-yemen">Human Rights Watch</a> and the <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/death-drones-report-eng-20150413.pdf">Open Society Foundations</a>,
 killed 12 civilians, including three children and a pregnant woman. No 
alleged militants died in the strike, and the Yemeni government paid 
restitution for it, but the United States never offered an explanation.</p>
<p>“The mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters of the people who 
were killed in these drones strikes want to know why,” said Amrit Singh,
 senior legal officer at the Open Society Justice Initiative. “We’re 
left with no explanation as to why they were targeted and in most cases 
no compensation, and the families are aware of no investigation.”</p>
<p>This spring, in a rare admission of a mistake in targeting, the White House <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/23/politics/white-house-hostages-killed/">announced</a>
 that two hostages held by al Qaeda — an American and an Italian — had 
been killed in a CIA drone strike in Pakistan in January. In attempting 
to explain the tragedy, the White House spokesperson used the language 
of the standards that had failed to prevent it: The hostages had died 
despite “near certainty,” after “near continuous surveillance,” that

<p class="rm-manual"><span>Wait! Before you go</span><span> on about 
your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read 
would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept 
hadn’t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without
 The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values 
they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, 
and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren’t 
on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but 
it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent 
nonprofit news outlet. We don’t have ads, so we depend on our members — 
35,000 and counting — to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining 
is simple and doesn’t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining 
member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That’s all it takes to support
 the journalism you rely on.</span><a href="https://join.theintercept.com/donate/now?referrer_post_id=40296&amp;source=web_intercept_in-article-long-2020-03-09" rel="noopener"><span>Become a Member </span></a></p>
