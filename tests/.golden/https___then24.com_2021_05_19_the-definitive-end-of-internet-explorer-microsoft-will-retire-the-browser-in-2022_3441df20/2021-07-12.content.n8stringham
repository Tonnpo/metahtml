<p>The end of an era. Next June 2022, after more than 25 years, Internet
 Explorer will come to an end. Microsoft has announced that they will 
withdraw browser support in favor of Microsoft Edge. “The future of 
Internet Explorer in Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge”, has indicated a 
person in charge of the company.</p>
<p>As indicated in the official blog, Internet Explorer 11 for desktop 
will no longer be supported on June 15, 2022 and will retire. </p>
<h2>Goodbye to the consumer version</h2>
<p>It must be said, this withdrawal will not be for everyone but it will
 be for most consumer users and versions of Windows 10 aimed at 
consumers. Microsoft will keep Internet Explorer on Windows 10’s 
Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) for example. This is done to continue
 offering support to companies that depend directly on the browser to 
carry out their operations. </p>
<p>What will Internet Explorer users be able to do? The few that remain,
 they will be able to use Microsoft Edge instead. Microsoft Edge 
includes for some years an “IE mode” that allows ActiveX controls and 
support for pages that are still based on Internet Explorer standards. 
Microsoft is committed to supporting this mode until at least 2029.</p>
<p>Throughout these last months Microsoft has repeatedly announced the 
end of support Internet Explorer gradually. No support in Microsoft 
Teams and no support in Microsoft 365 shortly. It also redirects to 
Microsoft Edge when opening some web pages.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft Edge appeared in 2015, the company has done its best 
to promote its use to users as opposed to Internet Explorer. The great 
advantage of Microsoft Edge is that it is a browser that is based on 
Chromium, so it is much more adapted to current Internet standards.</p>
