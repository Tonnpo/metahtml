<h1 class="rm-manual">Covid-19 vaccine registration status in Thailand: When is the registration and the vaccination date, here is what we know so far</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">By</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> - </p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Thursday, 27 May 2021, 21:52</span> </p>
<p class="">National –</p>
<p>During the third wave of the Covid-19 Coronavirus in Thailand, 
vaccination seems to be the only way to cope with the outbreak as well 
as to regain people’s confidence in the government, the country’s 
economic status, and the international perception towards the country, 
according to numerous organizations both pro and opposition to the Thai 
government.</p>
<p>Thailand is currently at the stage of vaccine distribution towards 
medical personnel, seniors above 60 years old, people who are in 
high-risk groups, tourist industry workers, people who are working in 
public services that are at risk of the spread of the virus (motorcycle 
taxi drivers, bus drivers, etc.), and those who are living near current 
clusters, particularly in crowded communities in Bangkok.</p>
<p>The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) has just opened its 
online platforms for Covid-19 vaccine registration for people between 
the age of 18 to 59 years old for the first time this afternoon, May 
27th. The registrations can be done from 12:00 PM. onwards at 
www.ไทยร่วมใจ.com, Pao Tung application, or convenience stores (7-11, 
Tops Daily, FamilyMart, and Mini Big C).</p>
<p>Three major service providers in Thailand, AIS, DTAC, and TrueMove H,
 have also opened registration platforms to receive the first shot of 
Covid-19 vaccination at Bangsue Grand Station of the capital next month 
for Thai nationals. This could vary from province to province.</p>
<p>Hundreds of private hospitals and 25 out-of-hospital vaccination 
centers in Bangkok are now providing, according to the Thai government, 
vaccination inoculations for people who register beforehand. The 
vaccines that will be used are Sinovac and AstraZeneca, depending on 
individual age and group registered. There is not, however, an open 
registration currently at EVERY hospital and multiple reports have been 
sent to TPN media of potential customers being told new registrations 
are not being accepted. Some hospitals are reportedly accepting to put 
people on lists to inform them when vaccines are available, but not all.
 As the situation changes on a near-daily basis, providing a complete 
list would not be feasible at this point.</p>
<p>In other provinces, vaccine distribution is being conducted at local 
hospitals for medical front liners and high-risk groups, prioritizing 
people with health conditions and seniorities over 60 years old. The 
registration can proceed differently in each province, according to the 
announcement of local authorities in certain provinces. Tourist-driven 
provinces like Phuket and Pattaya are also reportedly focusing on 
tourism workers.</p>
<p>Group vaccination for companies/staff are also allowed for private 
and public sectors nationwide. The companies can contact their 
Provincial Communicable Disease Committee in the province for 
registration. Large enterprises with personnel in many provinces, 
foreign agencies, and international organizations can contact the 
Department of Disease Control. Some foreigners have fallen into this 
category.</p>
<p>Regarding the government program registration for foreign nationals 
with long-term visas in Thailand, it is planned to be opened on June 
7th, according to the initial plan as announced by the CCSA. The on-site
 vaccination centers will be the hospital that has their health records 
or designated hospitals listed by the Ministry of Public Health. This 
list of designated hospitals has not yet been released. More details of 
the registration would be provided by local authorities prior to the 
starting date. Vaccines would likely be AstraZeneca. Those on tourist 
visas would need to pay for a vaccine and would not be eligible for the 
government program, according to the information released so far. 
Long-term visas would be ones like retirement, marriage, work permit, 
family, etc. Some workers with work permits have had success with their 
company registering them as stated above.</p>
<p>TPN Media notes that this is a VERY FLUID situation and subject to 
change. We have got many emails that some hospitals are accepting 
pre-registration and others are not. We will continue to monitor the 
situation and encourage our readers to mail us with any personal 
experiences, positive or negative, around finding vaccine registration 
on the ground. We would advise most foreign nationals to wait until more
 solid information is released from the Thai government, expected around
 June 7th.</p>
<p>Registering at a private hospital for a “paid” vaccine-like Moderna 
would need to be handled with that hospital. There is no timeline, dates
 given or idea when these would be available with some early information
 hinting at October.</p>
<p>AstraZeneca would be the main vaccination for both Thai and foreign 
nationals applying for the government program. Alternative vaccinations 
would be distributed at private hospitals for sale at about 3,000-4,000 
baht according to estimates from the Ministry of Public Health, although
 this price is not “set in stone”. It has not been confirmed by the 
Public Health Ministry which brands would be imported for local 
allocations, but there is the possibility that the first two brands of 
vaccination, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna, are likely to be 
imported into the country as they are already been approved by the Thai 
FDA.</p>
<p>According to the CCSA’s initial plan, about 100 million doses should 
be distributed among 70 percent of the total population in Thailand in 
order to create herd immunity. The first round of shots is planned to be
 completely inoculated by the end of October and the second shot is 
planned to be by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Vaccine information changes nearly daily in Thailand and we will 
continue to keep you updated as the situation is very fluid. Part of the
 reason for this is that many provinces are implementing their own plans
 from their own Governor which may be different from a national plan 
from the Ministry of Public Health.</p>
