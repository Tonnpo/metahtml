<p>This isn't a joke. Already in 2005, soon after The People's Cube was 
born, Google canceled us by removing the site from their search 
registry. Soon afterwards Cafepress canceled our "Che is Dead" t-shirts.
 In the next few years our numerous products also got canceled by Zazzle
 and Spreadshirt. Once we signed up on Facebook and Twitter, our posts 
got repeatedly canceled, our account suspended for days and weeks, our 
exposure restricted, and our presence shadowbanned. </p>
<p>We got canceled on Wikipedia by the woke public editors before they 
even called themselves "woke," and before "cancel culture" became the 
norm. After a few-month battle to keep our page alive in Wikipedia, we 
realized it was pointless and gave up trying. At various times we also 
got canceled by the Department of Defense and AT&amp;T commercial wi-fi 
networks. </p>
<p>And even before we moved to the U.S., the caring Soviet state had canceled our prospects of any career advancement. </p>
<p>So this t-shirt isn't a joke, but rather a story of my life. I'll wear it proudly and I know that many of you will, too.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Yes, most Red Square on cancelled before it was cool. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">When 'pelipsky first met Red Square on Shake Down 
Socialism tour, 'pelipsky had already been cancelled from teaching 
middle school remedial readers to read better for their own 
good...because 'pelipsky just 'might' be nuts. Of course, having the 
student who was so mixed up that he did an action item straight out of a
 Flannery O'Connor morality tale still sitting in class next to the rest
 of the collective's beet sprouts, while 'pelipsky was relieved of 
duties improving reading levels because 'pelipsky - the victim - was the
 obvious THREAT TO World Peace and safe learning environment was shoving
 'pelipsky into accepted nut status. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">CANCELLED! Before it was cool.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Which is why 'pelipsky had organized a kkklub that 
reeducated themselves on hard to read Federalist Papers which were 
nothing more than illiterate colonial's version of letters to the editor
 printed in uneducated about the purpose of government colonial 
newspapers. If not for this kkklub, Red Square would not have had a 
gathering of ignoramuses in Texazistan to speak to about his ideas about
 Shake Downs and Socialism.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Cancelling Red Square is to cancel ourselves. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">So that's the back story on how 3 decades ago the 
mythical horned rodent's mind was reshaped for the future, which is now 
the present. Look at the age of the get cancelled or we will burn down 
your livelihood pacifist groups and you will see what 30 years of 
'pelipsky NOT improving the reading levels of remedial readers at the 
neighborhood public school campus actually <a href="file:///cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>@ks like.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">That's the power of cancellation, comrades.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">'pelipsky is goin' to save up some rubles - what 
the going rate on recycled aluminum cans these days - so 'pelipsky can 
be walking billboard of what the Cancel Culture can do to the mind of a 
dumb bunny remedial reading teacher in order to keep all those Federal 
Programmed $$$$$$$$$$$ rollin' in to help fix the problem of beet 
sprouts not being able to read good or conduct themselves to certain 
norms of civilization. Poor mixed up student is now serving 75 in 
Texazistan's Prison Sentence for doing something...well...just a little 
mixed up in the head. Which was perfectly acceptable behavior to remain 
in desk sitting next your little beet sprout back in 1991.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">And no!! That is NOT a smirk!! That's just the 
normal face of a harelipped mythical horned rodent who graduated a whole
 bunch of Federalist Paper'd Constitution remediated readers right here 
in the collective. Those same remediated readers who sat in rapt 
attention as cancelled Red Square talked about Shake Downs and 
Socialism. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">That's why the mythical horned rodent MUST remain 
CANCELLED! That jackalopelipsky is nuts, as well as a damn fine enabler 
of a safe learning environment for American Liberty.</p>
