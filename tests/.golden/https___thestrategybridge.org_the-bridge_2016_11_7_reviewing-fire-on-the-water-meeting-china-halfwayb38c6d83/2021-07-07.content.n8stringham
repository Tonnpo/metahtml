Lyle Goldstein. Washington, D.C.: Georgetown University Press, 2015.</p>
<p>A pall hangs over Asia. At the center of this disquiet lies China, a 
nation too large and too proud for any power on its borders to long 
ignore. Ignore it they haven’t—<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-15/indonesia-to-destroy-71-boats-in-display-of-maritime-sovereignty">China’s</a> <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/china-warns-us-south-korea-will-pay-the-price-if-thaad-is-deployed-1.432048">relations</a> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china-japan-idUSKCN11Z10D">with</a> <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/beijing-snubs-taipei/article/2004577"> one</a> <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2023080/china-wades-singaporean-envoys-media-dispute">neighbor</a> <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/world/chinas-great-betrayal-why-did-indias-eastern-neighbour-block-the-nsg-bid-2853800.html">after</a> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-privatisation-ausgrid-idUSKCN10R2M1">another</a> <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/23/politics/obama-vietnam-trip/">worsen</a>. This was not how it was supposed to be.</p>
<p>For years Americans have held the fevered dream that they might 
entice China to become “a responsible stakeholder” in the existing 
international system, a system<a href="http://warontherocks.com/2016/06/the-choice-for-asia-in-the-21st-century/"> they fondly label</a>
 “a liberal rules based order.” It was always a desperate hope. The 
Chinese are not ruled by a liberal regime, and the regime that rules 
them cannot stomach any order whose rules are designed to force 
liberalism onto them. Americans were able to accommodate themselves to 
growing Chinese power because they hoped this would change—as China grew
 and became entangled with the wider world, the argument went, the wider
 world would change it.</p>
<p>It was not to be. Instead of opening themselves up to the currents of
 global culture, the Chinese Communist Party cracked down on every part 
of Chinese society with connections outside it, from Christian 
congregations to feminist activists. The Party also thought China might 
change with the wider world—and decided that the only thing to do was to
 move first, forcing the wider world to change with China instead.</p>
<p>Where to go from here? The Chinese have made their choice. <a href="http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2016/06/china-does-not-want-your-rules-based.html">They do not want our rules-based order</a>. The ball is in our court now. The hard thing is knowing what to do with it.</p>
<p>There is no consensus on the proper response to China’s rising 
ambitions. Two ambitious military analysts have stepped into the void, 
each hoping their bold proposals might dispel the Asian pall and secure a
 peaceful future for the Pacific. They approach this problem from a 
similar starting point. Robert Haddick asks in the first chapter of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Water-America-Future-Pacific/dp/1612517951/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475589577&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fire+on+the+water&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=theschssta-20&amp;linkId=76b5d438cc190b4a39b96534b0d5bc46">Fire on the Water: China, America, and the Future of the Pacific</a> if the United States “can safely accommodate China’s rise.” His reply is unequivocal:</p>
<blockquote>There is only one answer to that question: the United States
 must—it has no choice. China is a great power, with rapidly expanding 
economic, diplomatic, and military power... Both countries have an 
obligation, for both practical and moral reasons, to find a way to 
coexist.[1]</blockquote>
<p>This sentiment also suffuses Lyle Goldstein’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meeting-China-Halfway-Emerging-US-China/dp/1626161607/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475589241&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=meeting+china+halfway&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=theschssta-20&amp;linkId=ade5e17f47a73aa7739469253756a616">Meeting China Halfway: How to Defuse the Emerging U.S.-China Rivalry</a>.
 Goldstein states in the introduction to his book that Sino-American 
relations are “the most critical of bilateral relationships to world 
order for the current century, and likely the ones that follow as 
well.”[2] Both authors agree: China must be allowed some place in the 
international system. Consequently, they both reject more militant calls
 for regime change. Their shared goal is to use a blend of American 
military and diplomatic assets to reach a stable and enduring peace in 
the Western Pacific.</p>
<p>The extraordinary thing is how two authors so thoroughly committed to
 the same goals, and working from such similar starting assumptions, can
 offer policy prescriptions that so sharply contradict each other. </p>
<h3 class="">Fire On the Water</h3>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Water-America-Future-Pacific/dp/1612517951?SubscriptionId=0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82&amp;tag=strategbridge-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=1612517951" rel="noopener"> <span> Buy on Amazon </span> </a> </p>
<p>Robert Haddick’s book began as a classified report for Special 
Operations Command on the possible roles U.S. special forces might be 
expected to play in Asia’s future. Haddick soon realized a much broader 
review of U.S. forces’ position in the region was needed. Great changes 
were underway in East Asia, changes in the military balance of which 
many American leaders were not truly aware. Haddick suggests this is 
because an absolute disparity between the total size of the two rivals’ 
military budgets hides the weakness of the American position. What the 
People’s Liberation Army lacks in wealth, it has gained in focus. 
American military forces are deployed from one side of the globe to the 
other. Their doctrine and force structures suffer from the cross-cutting
 demands of the various theaters in which they may be asked to fight. 
The Chinese, in contrast, have focused, laser-like, on one objective for
 three decades: building a war machine that can keep the United States 
Navy away from its shores.</p>
<p>This intense focus on denying Americans access to the Chinese 
littoral (a strategy known in military jargon as an “anti-access/area 
denial” or <a href="http://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2015/12/13/chinas-military-strategy">A2/AD strategy</a>)
 is ideally suited to the likely shape of a future Sino-American 
conflict. The operational contours of such a conflict will be determined
 primarily by geography and technology. The weapons of our day, launched
 from plane, submarine, ship, truck, or launch pad, are both able to 
travel extremely long distances and hit carefully selected targets when 
they arrive at their destinations. The lethality of these technologies 
will be familiar to anyone who has seen the televised pin-prick strikes 
of American forces in the Balkans or the Middle East. Their lethality is
 only increased when the targets chosen are at sea or in the air. Under <a href="http://breakingdefense.com/2015/04/no-mans-sea-csbas-lethal-vision-of-future-naval-war/">a mature precision strike regime</a>
 there will be areas where ships and aircraft simply cannot go. The wars
 of Asia’s future will look like the Western Front in the First World 
War, but at sea. Each side would have a zone of control, protected by an
 interlocking network of anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles designed 
to keep the other from approaching. In between would lie a vast stretch 
of no-man’s land (or in this case, water) that could only be entered 
with great peril. Such a war would be grim, attritional, and enormously 
expensive. In this crash of steel against steel, victory would favor the
 side whose forces can shoot farthest, disperse fastest, stay hidden 
longest, and, in the end, be replenished most easily.[3]</p>
<p>The Chinese have devoted three decades to establishing advantages in 
each of these areas. America is far less prepared for such a struggle. 
Haddick finds problems just about everywhere, ranging from doctrine to 
weapon platforms to basing. Many of the themes that dominate Haddick’s 
work are clearly articulated in his critique of this last issue. 
America’s bases suffer from a crisis of concentration in that all U.S. 
forces in the region are located in a few select locations: six air 
bases for the Air Force, five ports for the Navy, and three locations 
for the vast majority of American ground forces in the region. In 
contrast, Chinese air and missile power is widely dispersed, and many of
 its missile launchers are completely mobile, able to hide and then 
redeploy miles away after each volley is launched. This is a deadly 
asymmetry. As Haddick reports, just “thirty to fifty impacts would 
render even a large [Air Force] base unusable.”[4] China has already 
invested in thousands of surface-to-surface missiles (SSM) that fit the 
bill. The only real defense against their attack is anti-missile 
batteries, and these cost far more to build and repair than the swarm of
 missiles that will be sent streaking towards them.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Image from Robert Haddick, Fire on the Water: 
China, America, and the Future of the Pacific (Annapolis: Naval 
Institute Press, 2014), 60.</p>
<p>Haddick reports that by 2020 the missile force will be joined by 400 or so <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/russias-f-15-killer-why-america-the-world-fears-the-su-27-17082">‘Flanker’ aircraft</a>, originally designed in and purchased from Russia, but now produced indigenously as <a href="http://aircraft.wikia.com/wiki/Shenyang_J-11">the Shenyang J-11</a>.
 Though in many respects the technical inferior to American aircraft 
such as the F-22 and the F-35, these planes are their superiors in one 
critical trait: range. Chinese Flankers have an unrefueled combat radius
 of 1,500 km, putting them well within range of American air and naval 
bases in Japan and Korea. In contrast, the new F-35, which some analysts
 estimate <a href="https://warisboring.com/how-much-does-an-f-35-actually-cost-21f95d239398#.3gus1gvpe">comes at the cost of $330 million a copy</a>,
 cannot travel more than 1,100 km away from its closest refueling point.
 The Flanker’s range ensures that bases in Korea and Japan “would not be
 able to safely host the tanker and early warning “enabler” aircraft on 
which U.S. tactical aircraft depend. U.S. Air Force operations in the 
Pacific would then depend on Guam, creating a risky single point of 
failure and a focus for Chinese targeting.”[5] When China’s 5th 
generation fighter, the J-20, goes into operation in 2018, it’s 2,000 km
 range threatens to push tanker and targeting aircraft out of the West 
Pacific altogether.[6]</p>
<p>This story repeats itself again and again. An American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arleigh_Burke-class_destroyer">DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer</a> costs $1.8 billion to build; the Russian designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-270_Moskit">SS-N-22 Sunburn supersonic</a>
 anti-ship cruise missile intended to destroy it only costs $2 million. 
These missiles also out distance America’s own ship based anti-ship 
cruise missile, the <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=2200&amp;tid=200&amp;ct=2">A/U/RGM-84 Harpoon</a>,
 by more than 250 kilometers. Even worse, Chinese land-based 
intermediate range missiles face no competition from the Americans at 
all, as the United States and Russia banned their development in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate-Range_Nuclear_Forces_Treaty">a cold war treaty meant to reduce tensions between NATO and the Soviet Union</a>.
 This means the only assets able to pierce the Chinese area of control 
are America’s long range stealth bombers and submarine force. These are 
expensive platforms, and they have a limited carrying capacity. For 
perspective, 864 Tomahawk missiles could be fired by U.S. submarines in 
the Pacific before needing to return to port to reload—a fraction of the
 35,085 munitions used against the Iraqi army, a third rate power, 
during six weeks of operations during the Gulf war.[7]</p>
<p>Image from Robert Haddick, Fire on the Water: China, America, and the
 Future of the Pacific (Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 2014), 91.</p>
<p>Haddick proposes a suite of concrete measures to tilt the military 
balance back in favor of the United States. These range from changes in 
organizational culture and new international arms treaties to the the 
development of autonomous<a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/locaas.htm"> autonomous bomber drones</a>.
 Haddick has a talent for explaining how otherwise obscure topics of 
defence analysis, like the technical capabilities of weapon platforms or
 the quirks of military doctrine, place real pressures on broader issues
 of policy. His sharp rebuke to those who hope growing parity between 
the two powers will create a stable foundation for long term negotiation
 is a case in point. The main consequence of a military force as brittle
 as Pacific Command’s, he suggests, is that if open conflict ever seems 
to be even a remote possibility American leaders will face a powerful 
temptation to strike early, before the Chinese have prepared their own 
knock-out strike. Knowledge that American forces in the region can be 
knocked out in a devastating first blow is not a recipe for peace and 
stability.[8]</p>
<p>Haddick hopes a more resilient, prepared, and effective U.S. fighting
 force in the Pacific will not just change the incentives Americans 
face, but also the incentives faced by the other powers in the region. 
Haddick couples his description of the modernization drive of the 
People’s Liberation Army with a discussion of China’s famous ‘salami 
slicing’ operations near its borders. Haddick calls for a quiet but firm
 response to these slices—but he is clear that he believes that no 
response to these operations will be able to dissuade the Chinese from 
their current course unless the nature of America’s military presence in
 the region is strong and stable enough to provide a powerful deterrent.
 The costs of failing to deter Chinese intimidation, In Haddick’s eyes, 
are far larger than future American defeat. Haddick’s nightmare scenario
 is a Western Pacific that has reverted to anarchy, each nation seeking 
independent military means to deter Chinese power. Though he doesn’t 
quite say it this way, Haddick essentially endorses the view that 
America’s most important role in post-World War II East Asia has been to
 keep Japan and Korea under control. Without American hegemony a fierce 
security competition would sweep the region, as countries try to balance
 against China and each other. In place of a stable American-led order 
unifying the field against revanchist China would be a Hobbesian swarm 
of nations ready to plunge one part of the continent into war after 
another.[9]</p>
<p>The only way to avoid such a future is if America can maintain a 
military presence in the region robust enough to assuage the fears of 
America’s allies while “persuading China’s leaders to continue accepting
 the status quo in spite of China’s rising global security 
interests.”[10] This would require a much larger military footprint in 
the region, but the goal would be a stable peace. As Haddick concludes:</p>
<blockquote class="">The strategy discussed in this book is not a war 
plan. It is a strategy for managing a peacetime competition in a highly 
dynamic region. The strategy’s success will be measured by the crises 
that never occur, the wars that are never fought, and the long 
continuation of the region’s prosperity and development, including 
inside China.[11]</blockquote>
<h3 class="">Meeting China Halfway</h3>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meeting-China-Halfway-Emerging-US-China/dp/1626161607?SubscriptionId=0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82&amp;tag=strategbridge-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=1626161607" rel="noopener"> <span> Buy on Amazon </span> </a> </p>
<p>Lyle Goldstein would endorse these metrics for the grand strategy he 
charts in Meeting China Halfway: How to Defuse Emerging U.S. China 
Rivalry. The means he uses to reach this destination, however, could not
 be more different. His book’s title reveals his approach; unlike 
Haddick, Goldstein has no interest in deterrence. The operative verb in 
Goldstein’s work is not deter but defuse. Above all else Goldstein fears
 what political scientists call a “security trap,” an escalating contest
 between two powers to gain advantage over the other, each move 
increasing the costs both must bear to remain competitive and each 
riposte decreasing the space for withdrawal or retreat. Goldstein 
believes that most books written to guide America away from these traps 
lack the “concrete intellectual paradigms” and “accompanying policy 
proposals” needed to turn high sounding rhetoric about peace and 
prosperity into realistic guidelines for action.[12] Goldstein uses an 
innovative concept he labels a “cooperation spiral” to provide both of 
these things.</p>
<p>The concept of a cooperation spiral is fairly simple. A grand bargain
 between Chinese and American policymakers is the end goal of all 
spirals presented in the book, but concessions and compromise do not 
start with the great issues. Instead, cooperation spirals are “gradual, 
evolutionary, and reciprocal” creations, intended to build trust between
 the two sides on smaller issues. Each iteration of compromises building
 momentum for a larger and more stable set of compromises to come.[13] 
Thus the cooperation spiral designed to resolve cross-straits 
relations—which in its final incarnation includes the complete cessation
 of arms sales to Taiwan, final status negotiations between the People’s
 Republic of China and the government of Taiwan, and a ban of any 
permanent Communist Party of China and People’s Liberations Army 
presence on the island—begins with much more modest concessions: a 
limited reduction of U.S. forces on Guam from the American side, and the
 initiation of military exchanges between the People’s Liberation Army 
and Republic of China’s armed forces (without preconditions) on the 
Chinese side. These early concessions are limited in scale, and if the 
Chinese do not reciprocate, then the Americans can easily reverse them. 
Reciprocity is key to the entire process, and this is what distinguishes
 Goldstein’s approach from mere appeasement: he never asks the United 
States to make painful concessions and compromises without asking an 
equal sacrifice from the Chinese.[14]</p>
<p>Image from Lyle Goldstein, Meeting China Halfway: How To Defuse 
Emerging China-U.S. Rivalry (Washington DC: Georgetown University Press,
 2015), 284.</p>
<p>These cooperation spirals are presented with sweeping scope. Spirals 
are offered not only for hot-buttons like the South China Sea, the 
Korean Peninsula, and Cross-Straits relations, but also climate change 
and environmental concerns; Sino-American economic relations; economic 
cooperation, competition, and investment in Africa, Latin America, and 
the Middle East; and the two countries’ trilateral relationship with 
both India and Japan. Each of these spirals is preceded by a survey of 
the public debate Americans and Chinese have had about these issues in 
prominent research articles, policy proposals, and op-eds. Goldstein’s 
surveys of the Chinese language debates are probably the most important 
(and certainly the most interesting) sections of the entire book, 
providing American readers with a rare glimpse of discussions to which 
they would not otherwise be privy.[15] His policy proposals follow 
naturally from the literature reviews. Goldstein is aware that there is a
 temptation to nitpick at the various proposals (one hundred in total) 
listed in the book. He welcomes this, encouraging issue and area experts
 to “propose superior cooperation spirals, with greater specificity, 
realism, and thus promise to improve the relationship.”[16] This is a 
wise approach. In international affairs, conditions change quickly 
enough that rigid adherence to any set of proposals would leave the lot 
of them out of date. The true meat in Goldstein’s book is in the broad 
conceptual approach he outlines; its myriad applications simply 
illustrate how that approach might be turned from concept into policy.</p>
<p>It is thus in terms of broad concepts Meeting China Halfway must be 
judged—and it is here Meeting China Halfway is most deserving censure. 
Goldstein’s approach is simply unworkable. Any attempt to apply it in 
the real world would be met with immediate cries of outrage that the 
entirety of America’s foreign relations and domestic policies were being
 sacrificed to the God of Close Sino-American Ties. Just a sampling of 
these recommendations illustrates the problem. For the sake of various 
cooperation spirals, Goldstein recommends that the U.S. government 
formally acknowledge Israel as a nuclear weapons state, stop all drone 
attacks in Pakistan, invest in high speed rail infrastructure projects 
across the continental United States, and disband Africa Command. These 
policies may be of themselves worthy ones, but the hope that they will 
be widely adopted for the sake of stronger Sino-American relations is 
fantastic.</p>
<p>The reason for this is fairly simple: subordination of global policy 
to Sino-American cooperation (or, for that matter, Sino-American 
rivalry) is the subordination of the entire American bureaucracy to its 
few China hands. As a China hand, I welcome the status and authority 
this new conception of world affairs might grant me—but I would not want
 to be the man tasked with telling the fellows over at AFRICOM they must
 close up shop for the sake of improved U.S.-China relations! The 
resistance of the non-Asianists in the U.S. bureaucracy and foreign 
policy community to a Goldstein-style foreign policy will be too 
ferocious to bear.</p>
<p>The reaction of U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific would also be 
terrible to face. Goldstein is curiously dismissive of these allies’ 
concerns. One can sympathize with the time constraints that shaped his 
treatment of them—a titanic amount of research was required simply to 
survey the existing debates inside Washington D.C. and Beijing, and it 
would be too much to expect Goldstein to provide a thorough survey of 
the debates being had in Seoul, Manila, Taipei, Tokyo, Singapore, and 
New Delhi as well; but this unwillingness to consider events as seen by 
anyone outside of Beijing or Washington leads Goldstein to bizarre 
places. He outright dismisses Taiwan’s 23 million citizens with the curt
 (and unsubstantiated) claim that those who seek to put Taiwanese 
opinion first in discussions of their future “lack an objective view of 
history, culture, and identity.”[17] Goldstein dismisses other allies’ 
fears that Beijing’s growing strength might harm their interests by 
comparing them to children’s “talk of monsters hiding under the bed or 
in the closet.”[18] Patronizing comments of this sort undermine the 
spirit of mutual understanding Goldstein claims is central to successful
 strategy for peace. Meeting China Halfway begins with an earnest appeal
 to not treat the Chinese with arrogance, paternalism, or undue 
hypocrisy. This appeal would be far stronger if he avoided these same 
vices when discussing the lesser powers in the region.[19]</p>
<h3>Weighing Fire and Cooperation on Fundamentals</h3>
<p>This partly answers the puzzle of how these two analysts could start 
off so similarly but end up so far apart. Haddick thinks that serious 
consideration of the perceptions and interests of regional powers are 
critical to a successful China policy. Goldstein believes they can be 
dismissed as easily as the monsters hiding in toddler’s closets. 
Goldstein never discusses what will happen if lesser powers decide they 
do not wish to play along with the division of Asia into two great 
spheres of interest. This is Haddick’s nightmare scenario.</p>
<p>But this is not their biggest difference. The essence of Goldstein’s argument is that:</p>
<blockquote>China must make a comprehensive effort to increase the 
transparency of its national security apparatus, reform some of its 
long-held claims, and influence certain partners to conform to 
international norms. In a series of de-escalatory steps, the United 
States should reciprocate by limiting the scope of its military 
deployments and military engagement activities.[20]</blockquote>
<p>This is almost exactly the opposite of Haddick’s recommendations for the region.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference between the two analysts is their theory 
of what makes the Communist Party of China tick. Reading these two books
 next to each other is a reminder of just how important an analyst’s 
inner model of Chinese decision making is.[21] Under Goldstein's schema,
 fear of American power, not contempt for American weakness, is what has
 led the Chinese down the path they now tread. Haddick's case is built 
on the opposite view. Not all they have to say, but a great deal of it, 
follows from these opposing opening assumptions.</p>
<p>It is these assumptions—these unstated models of Chinese decision making—that keep me from endorsing either argument. I have <a href="http://scholars-stage.blogspot.tw/2016/06/china-does-not-want-your-rules-based.html">presented a</a> <a href="http://scholars-stage.blogspot.tw/2016/06/arms-and-influence-in-south-china-sea.html">different</a> <a href="http://scholars-stage.blogspot.tw/2016/07/costly-signaling-in-south-china-sea.html">version</a> of what makes Beijing tick. As I (along with folks like <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.sg/mediacentre/pm-lee-hsien-loongs-interview-wall-street-journal-wsj">Lee Hisen Loong</a> and <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/pavlovian-conditioning-and-correct-thinking-on-the-south-china-sea">Bilahauri Kaukisan</a>)
 have argued, Xi Jinping’s regime believes that the Western-led liberal 
order and the demands it makes on those who join it are corrosive to 
authoritarian control, and will eventually lead to the collapse of the 
Party.[22] For them the Party comes first. When translated into concrete
 policy, “putting the Party first” means eliminating Western influence 
from within and actively reshaping regional rules from without. What 
China is doing is not an inevitable consequence of great power 
competition, but the fruits of very specific fears of a specific ruling 
regime.</p>
<p>If this explanation for China’s behavior is correct, then neither 
Haddick’s nor Goldstein’s proposals are tenable. Haddick's entire 
strategy is predicated on the idea that you can build a military machine
 whose might will raise the costs of conflict so high that the Chinese 
must eventually back down. But if Zhongnanhai serves the Party before it
 serves the country then none of that matters. The Communist Party of 
China’s continued domination of China is justified to the Chinese public
 on the grounds that hostile Western forces have always sought to 
contain and cripple China, but under the guardianship of the Party, the 
Chinese people will never be forced to bow down to foreign powers again.
 Backing down and accepting Western order threatens their legitimacy. It
 is an existential threat to their continued rule. The costs of war 
cannot compete with this. In the worst case war scenario, Party leaders 
suffer the same fate they would most likely suffer in any existential 
crisis (violent death); at best, they get lucky and win the war. This is
 not a recipe for stability.</p>
<p>This model of Chinese decision making also makes Goldstein's 
cooperation spirals exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to 
implement. Beijing does not just fear specific American policies—it 
fears the entire American-led system. The Chinese can bide and endure 
this order, but they cannot permanently compromise with it. It is hard 
to compromise with a system whose existence threatens your survival.</p>
<h2>There are probably less than a hundred people on this planet who 
actually know why Beijing does what it does. They are unlikely to share 
this information with American analysts.</h2>
<p>One’s inner model of Chinese decision making thus matters quite a 
lot. The most disturbing thing about reading these books together, 
however, is that neither of these analysts, exceedingly intelligent and 
well respected in their field, pauses to explain where their assumed 
model of Chinese decision making comes from. These operating assumptions
 are left unstated and unproven, despite how readily everything else 
these authors write follow from them.</p>

Council (Central government) of the People's Republic of China. (Yanan 
Peng/Wikimedia)</p>
<p>This is possibly because these analysts did not realize the 
importance of these assumptions. But it may also reflect just how 
difficult it is to prove that the model of Chinese decision making one 
uses is actually correct. Here I am just as guilty as every other China 
hand; I cannot prove that my own model of Chinese decision making is the
 right one. The best I can say is that it fits Chinese behavior over the
 last two decades better than anything else I have seen proposed.[23] 
But in the end neither I, nor any other analyst of Chinese foreign 
policy, actually knows what is happening behind the walls of 
Zhongnanhai. There are probably less than a hundred people on this 
planet who actually know why Beijing does what it does. They are 
unlikely to share this information with American analysts.</p>

<p>Our analysis is built on a foundation of sand. We offer bold 
proclamations and precise policy proposals designed to cajole, convince,
 or coerce a hostile nuclear power whose decision making process is 
utterly opaque to us. We theorize much, and assume more, but we still do
 not know why the Chinese do what they do. Most critically, we do not 
know how to find the knowledge we lack. This is an intellectual 
challenge we have not begun to meet. Understanding Zhongnanhai is a 
wonderful methodological puzzle—but a puzzle with nuclear stakes. Until 
we solve this puzzle, I doubt any number of policy prescriptions will be
 enough to ensure peace in the West Pacific.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> [6] They pose a similar threat to American carrier strike groups. When armed with Chinese-built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YJ-12">Yingji</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YJ-12"> 12 anti-ship cruise missiles</a>,
 a Flanker squadron’s striking range would also outdistance the Aegis 
air defense and reconnaissance system that defends every American 
carrier strike group by several hundred kilometer. This would allow them
 to fire their missile loads with little fear of being destroyed by the 
carrier group’s defensive screen. Two or three waves of such attacks, 
coming from different axes, would almost certainly score a hit. Even if 
the carrier was unharmed by this barrage, the Flankers would be 
victorious, for the carrier group, now bereft its entire defensive 
missile bank, would be forced to retreat to safer waters lest the entire
 strike group, with its $13 billion aircraft carrier at its center, be 
destroyed by the next salvo. As Haddick argues, “Accepting that the 
strike group would shoot down some Flankers before they launched their 
anti-ship missiles, the strike group would still have to contend with 
125 to 200 incoming ASCMs, which would make wave-top, supersonic 
approaches to the U.S. ships. In past engagements of anti-ship missiles 
against alerted surface warships, 32 percent of attacking missiles 
scored hits. If only 5 percent of the ASCMs scored hits, the carrier 
strike group’s ships would still receive five to ten missile impacts, 
likely causing enough damage to render the group ineffective and 
possibly defenseless against another attack.” (96-97).</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> [14] For the full cross straits cooperation cycle, see ibid, 60-72.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> [15] To provide one example, I suspect most 
Americans will be just as surprised as I was to discover that many 
prominent voices in the Chinese policy scene argue that the Obama 
administration’s push for a climate deal is actually a covert attempt to
 depress Chinese economic growth!</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> [16] Ibid, 15.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> [17] Goldstein backs this argument up with one of 
the most curious arguments for cross straits unity I have ever had the 
misfortune to read. “Few Westerners realize that the Taiwan dialect is 
called Minnan Hua, which literally means “speech of those south of the 
Min River.” But the Min River is located not on Taiwan but in Fujian 
Province.”(76) This is technically true, but it betrays an unfamiliarity
 with Taiwan and its people. Outside the stray professional linguist, no
 Taiwanese person ever refers to the local dialect as Minnan Hua. To a 
man they all call it Taiyi (台语), “the language of Taiwan,” or as it is 
most often translated into English, Taiwanese. It should be no surprise 
that the use of this language is at the center of Taiwanese growing 
nationalist sentiment.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> [18] Ibid, 358.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> [19] This hypocrisy is most glaring in Goldstein’s
 discussions of history. Goldstein states that his “book is built on the
 premise that history cannot be overlooked or papered over,"(14) and to 
drive the point home, he devotes an entire chapter to the history of 
U.S.-Chinese relations, driving in on the history of U.S. imperialism in
 China and the psychological after effects America’s imperial presence 
has in the China of today. This contrasts greatly with his treatment of 
China’s own foreign adventurism. Goldstein’s gloss of the Sino-Indian 
war of 1963, for example, devotes several paragraphs to the CIA attempt 
to arm and train Tibetan rebels, something the Chinese still remember. 
What he does not emphasize in this account are the events at the center 
of India’s historical memory—Nehru’s generous and unilateral concessions
 in favor of China in the 1950s, made in hope of a new partnership 
between the two countries, spurned by Mao on the grounds of domestic 
struggle. In India this rejection of Nehru’s offers is known as the 
“great betrayal,” and the culmination of this “betrayal” in the surprise
 attack on Indian forces in 1963 still defines Indian images of China 
today. This history as surely as important—I would argue far more 
important—to the future of Sino-Indian security than the CIA’s attempts 
to infiltrate Tibet. It is not mentioned. Readers also learn nothing 
about the violent legacy of China’s cold war policies in other countries
 discussed, despite the that every regional single power of note either 
fought a war directly with China or fought an insurgency funded and 
trained by Beijing. Goldstein describes attempts to stoke the flame of 
Maoist insurgency across southeast Asia in the 60s and 70s are as 
“certain errors in diplomacy,”(266) but anyone remotely familiar with 
the countries in question know they have left much larger historical 
scars than this. These wars lie within living memory; their influence on
 contemporary Asian politics is far clearer than the early 20th century 
imperialism Goldstein devotes so much time to. Goldstein either does not
 know about this history or he does not care about it.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> [21] Haddick actually claims that his proposed 
strategy is intended to work absent any knowledge of China’s inscrutable
 intentions, but the rest of the book undermines this argument. Haddick 
argues that the key to stability is ensuring that the benefits of 
cooperating with the existing rules far exceed the costs of bucking 
them. But this could only possibly be effective when the deterring power
 understands how those they deter calculate benefits and costs. Though 
Haddick refuses to explicitly state his view on Chinese intentions and 
long term designs, his strategy implicitly says a great deal on the 
matter.</p>
