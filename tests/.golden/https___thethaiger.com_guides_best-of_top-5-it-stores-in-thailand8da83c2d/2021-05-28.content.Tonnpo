<p class="rm-manual">Finding a top<a href="https://thethaiger.com/issues-answers/asked/all-about-thai-lawyers"> lawyer in Thailand</a> is often very important for foreigners as it can be the difference between a jail sentence or a financial nightmare. <a href="https://www.lawyerscouncil.or.th/2019/en/homepage/">The Lawyers Council of Thailand</a>
 is one organisation that can offer legitimate advice, in addition to 
pointing those seeking representation in the right direction. Personal 
injuries, car accidents, and business start-ups are some of the most 
common situations in which a lawyer’s expert advice and representation 
is required.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Apart from needing expert advice when going to 
court, expats often find it difficult to understand the legal process, 
with translation needs ranking at the top of the list of desired 
services. But remember to make sure your lawyer understands your needs 
and helps you navigate Thai laws with ease and accuracy.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">5 Top lawyers in Thailand</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Best of Thailand’s lawyers, listed below.</span></p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">1. Siam Legal</h3>

large, it is sure to have more than 1 lawyer working on your case.</p>

law firm popular with foreigners. As anyone needing help can simply 
message the firm, and expect to hear from them in just a few days. In

<p class="rm-manual">Bangkok is a great city for visitors to recharge 
their batteries however they want – whether it’s getting pampered, 
partying the night away or a combination of both. Every corner of the 
capital now has a wellness destination (even if they aren’t visible from
 the street). These spas, which range from affordable Thai massage 
parlours to luxury hotel sanctuaries, are the capital’s hotspots for 
relaxation and pampering. We know that being in the capital of the Land 
of Spas means there are plenty of options. But we’ve narrowed it down to
 just 5 of the most relaxing and peaceful spas in Bangkok that will take
 the stress out of everyday life.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Please note that due to COVID, opening times may 
differ and some spas may be closed. Please be sure to check before you 
make any plans.</p>

can soak and relax for hours. Further, there’s a carbonated soda water 
pool, a jet pool, and an onsen pool with 43-degree mineral “healing” 
water sourced from the Raksawarin hot springs. These temperatures and 
mineral content of the water help to relieve mental stress and relax 
your muscles. And as a result, your body will be more receptive to the 
benefits of their Thai massages’ (which you can book on top of your 
Onsen bath).</p>
<p class="rm-manual">After relaxing in the baths, guests can visit the 
large spa treatment area upstairs for aromatherapy or traditional Thai 
massage treatments. Finally, they are open daily from 9:00 am – 12:00

<p class="rm-manual">Please keep in mind that during COVID, all opening 
times are subject to change so make sure to double-check before you 
visit any of these places.</p>
<h3 class="rm-manual">1. Apsara Cruise </h3>
<p class="rm-manual">A Chao Phraya River cruise is romantic in and of 
itself, but add in some of Bangkok’s finest dining and drinks, and 
you’ve got yourself the perfect date setting.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The Apsara (operated by the Banyan Tree Hotel) is 
perfect for couples who want to indulge in a 4-course dinner while 
enjoying the view of the Chao Phraya at night. Some examples of the 
cuisine include curries, soups and desserts that are all freshly 
prepared on board.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Along the cruise, you will pass landmarks such as 
the Temple of Dawn and the Grand Palace. The boat departs at 8:00 pm and
 lasts for approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes. And although you miss 
the sunset, the river is most peaceful at this time of the day and the 
temples are beautifully lit up.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Best features: This intimate cruise is on a 
vintage-rice barge that has been restored into an elegant dining room. 
The hues of the orange interior coupled with the dark wood furniture is 
emblematic of Thai heritage and as you cruise along, the sounds of 
traditional Thai instruments play in the background. The cruise, 
therefore will not only be an authentic and immersive Thai experience 
but a romantic one as well.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Pricing: Walk-in prices start from 2,550 baht/adult and 1,275 baht/child.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Locations: Pick up and drop-off is at River City Pier: 23 Soi Charoen Krung 24, Talat Noi, Samphanthawong, Bangkok 10100.</p>

<h3 class="rm-manual">2. Penthouse Rooftop</h3>
<p class="rm-manual">Penthouse Rooftop is an elegant dining and drinking
 destination located on the Park Hyatt’s top three floors. Up at the 
top, you can enjoy breathtaking 360-degree views of Bangkok’s skyline 
while indulging in delicious Western and Asian cuisines and world-class 
mixology.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">This is a luxurious and sophisticated venue, high 
above the hustle and bustle of Bangkok, with both outdoor and indoor 
seating. It stands out from other sky bars by its design concept: 
“Penthouse Bar and Grill is a unique collection of six venues; The 
Grill, Chef’s Table, The Cocktail Bar, Whisky Room and The Mezzanine, 
resonating lavish Chicago and New York penthouses, located on levels 34,
 35 and 35M on top of the Park Hyatt Bangkok”. Taking all of these into 
consideration, Penthouse is perfect for a romantic night out. And if you
 want to amplify the love, come at sunset and relax on their plush 
seating!</p>
<p class="rm-manual">They are open daily from 11:30 AM – 11: 00 PM and have a dress code of smart casual.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Best features: Unlike the rooftop bars at other 
five-star hotels, the cocktails at Penthouse are affordable and aren’t 
light on the booze. We recommend trying their signature drink, the 
Oriental twist on Paloma, made with pomelo and oolong tea syrup and 
Patron Silver tequila (B360).</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Pricing: Prices start at 170 baht.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Locations: 34th – 35th Floor, Park Hyatt Bangkok,

porcelain. In fact, some of these treasures are almost 1,400 years old.
