<p> If we want to understand how powerful an opponent SARS-CoV-2 
(COVID-19) is, letâ€™s take a look what has been required to stop it in 
China. The Chinese government has essentially used a social nuclear 
weapon in its efforts. Letâ€™s talk about this, to understand what US is
 facing. <span> 1/</span> </p>
<p> The Chinese have had the most COVID19 cases so far (80,859), but the
 number of new cases has dropped from 100's per day a month ago to ~46 
per day now â€” in a country of 1.4B people. This is an astonishing 
achievement from a public health point of view. <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200308-sitrep-48-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=16f7ccef_4">who.int/docs/default-sâ€¦</a> <span> 2/</span> </p>
<p> We can get a sense of how strong something is by getting a sense of 
what sort of force is required to stop it, to borrow a Newtonian physics
 metaphor. COVID-19 requires a powerful force to stop. This is clear 
from the Chinese response. <span> 3/</span> </p>
<p> Of course, China has a collectivist culture and an authoritarian 
government, both of which have allowed this enormous, widespread 
response. It is well suited to fight a pandemic, if it indeed takes in 
factual information and responds rationally. (Evokes Chernobyl <a href="https://twitter.com/clmazin">@clmazin</a>) <span> 4/</span> </p>
<p> Ably assisted by some Chinese students in my lab <a href="file:///hashtag/HNL">#HNL</a>,
 we quantified what Chinese government has been able to achieve. 
Beginning January 23, they imposed movement restrictions (typically with
 people staying at home, leaving just once a week) on provinces with 
&gt;930M people! <span> 5/</span> </p>
<p> The imposition of such public health measures on such a scale for 
such a duration has never been seen before. Here are links to the 
websites for many of the provinces into which China is divided, 
indicating what the rules for movement, imposed on 930M people, have 
been. 6/ </p>
<p> Most Chinese cities are still implementing these types of quarantine
 at the community-level, now over *six weeks* in, depending on the 
severity level of the situation in their cities. This is called 
"closed-off management" å°é—­ç®¡ç† by the government and media). <span> 7/</span> </p>
<p> Common features of "closed-off managementâ€ include: movement of 
people &amp; vehicles is checked with an exit-entrance permit; body 
temperature at entrance of community is checked; disinfection of 
vehicles; food delivery; permits for only one person per household to go
 out. <span> 8/</span> </p>
<p> The licenses for personal travel in China, being used by many 
millions of people, look like this. Some of them have a slogan â€œIt is 
everyoneâ€™s responsibility to fight the virus.â€ 10/ </p>
<p> In many cities, workers have been organized on a vast scale to 
deliver food to homes; residents can only go out to shop if they have a 
permit; &amp; shops are open at limited times. In Chongqing, for 
example, only one person per household can go out shopping, only 
occasionally. <span> 11/</span> </p>
<p> Schools have moved online. Jokes circulate: Parents complain to 
upstairs neighbors: "Could you please have your kids stop jumping? It is
 too noisy and our kids are taking an online math class now.â€ The 
neighbors reply: "Oh sorry! But my kids are taking a sports class 
now.â€ <span> 12/</span> </p>
<p> As a result, the Chinese have dropped the Re (the Effective 
Reproductive Rate) of COVID19 from ~3.8 new cases per extant case to 
~0.32. When this number is below 1.0, the epidemic extinguishes (at 
least it will, for a while, within China). <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593v1">medrxiv.org/content/10.110â€¦</a> <span> 13/</span> </p>
<p> My lab, <a href="file:///hashtag/HNL">#HNL</a>, has been studying this topic in another way, along with Chinese collaborators. We are also developing forecasting tools. NB <a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates">@BillGates</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/niranjanbose">@niranjanbose</a> (with gratitude). More about that in a future thread. <span> 14/</span> </p>
<p> The Chinese government is slowly beginning to lift restrictions, but
 it is continuing to implement many quite inventive procedures, on a 
large scale. For instance, elevators in a Beijing building only allow 
four people at a time, as marked by tape on the floor. 15/ </p>
<p> The sign in the elevator says: "No more than four people in the 
elevator. Please be patient and wait for the next elevator.â€ Below, it
 says "Let's unite together to fight the virus in this special period." 
This type of collectivist slogan is very common throughout China now. 
16/ </p>
<p> Currently, some provinces are adjusting their emergency level 
downwards according to their risk-level evaluations. As of March 2, 7 
provinces adjusted to second-level, 9 provinces to third-level, 4 
provinces to just the within-province emergency level. <a href="http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/03/02/697916.html">bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/03/0â€¦</a> <span> 17/</span> </p>
<p> China has a collectivist culture and an authoritarian government, so
 its success fighting COVID-19, while deeply impressive, will not be 
easy to reproduce elsewhere. The USA must prepare to combat the virus 
using tools at its disposal. It will not be easy. <span> 18/</span> </p>
<p> Here is a map and a timeline describing the imposition of "closed 
off management" restrictions at the provincial level across China as 
part of the effort to cope with <a href="file:///hashtag/COVID19">#COVID19</a>. 19/ </p>
<p> Another example of social distancing, widely employed in China, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/aoziparis">@aoziparis</a>.
 This is a photo from Henan province, just to the north of Hubei, one 
month ago. Shoppers, when they are allowed out, wait in a line, 1.5m 
away from each other, before entering grocery store. 20/ </p>
<p> More examples of line-forming with social distancing in China via <a href="https://twitter.com/ECtHRwatch">@ECtHRwatch</a> 21/ </p>
<p> Working with industry, Chinese authorities encouraged delivery 
companies to distribute goods, and the companies vouched that their 
drivers were wearing masks and did not have a fever. The app used noted 
such details as the driver approach. 22/ </p>
<p> This article <a href="http://news.cctv.com/2020/02/20/ARTIqdzcHtncA8Vphq0nnAII200220.shtml">news.cctv.com/2020/02/20/ARTâ€¦</a>
 says that, as of late February, in low risk locales, delivery companies
 should resume service but minimize risk during the whole delivery 
process -- by wearing face masks, disinfecting vehicles, &amp; checking 
body temperature daily. <span> 23/</span> </p>
<p> As workers in China return to offices, many systems are being put 
into place, such as at restaurants and cafeterias, to maintain social 
distancing. These include rules to eat fast, one-person-to-a-table, 
cardboard dividers, and admonitions not to talk to each other. 24/ </p>
<p> Gallows humor prevails among Chinese coping w COVID19. Re procedures
 now in use for eating out, many are saying "This one table per person 
experience reminds me of my old school days while taking exams." "I feel
 like I was taking exams in my high school while having lunch." <span> 25/</span> </p>
<p> Fabulous detailed description of the Chinese system of dealing with 
COVID-19 suspected cases, with testing facilities, isolation, and 
treatment. Down to a science. Via <a href="https://twitter.com/maddow">@maddow</a> h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/mqdicer">@mqdicer</a> <span> 26/</span> </p>
<p> I will continue to add to this thread as I get more photos from my 
Chinese students and colleagues about how China experienced and coped 
with COVID-19. Many of these anecdotes are useful, amazing, and even 
amusing. Here goes: <span> 27/</span> </p>
<p> People use small sticks to push the elevator button (the text reads 
"The elevator has been disinfected. Please use the stick to push the 
button. Please discard the stick in the box below after you have used 
it." 28/ </p>
<p> Interrupting my narrative about China, here are similar photos in Korea (<a href="https://attracttour.com/2020/02/hotel-in-seoul-south-korea-use-toothpick-when-pressing-elevator-in-attempt-to-contain-coronavirus/">attracttour.com/2020/02/hotel-â€¦</a>) and Iran (<a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2020/03/05/Over-3-500-coronavirus-cases-in-Iran-107-deaths-Health-ministry.html">english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middleâ€¦</a>). I think the USA should start doing this. <a href="file:///hashtag/elevatorsticks">#elevatorsticks</a> <a href="file:///hashtag/fomites">#fomites</a> /29 </p>
<p> In China, apparently the young were more concerned initially about 
COVID19 than the old, who were nonchalant. Images like this circulated. 
It's good not to panic or be alarmist; but it's also good not to be 
complacent. <a href="file:///hashtag/gallowshumor">#gallowshumor</a> 30/ </p>
<p> This image became a meme, and was transformed. This made me laugh 
out loud, as it reflects a bit the transition in my own family and 
friends. More <a href="file:///hashtag/gallowshumor">#gallowshumor</a> related to COVID19 in China. 31/ </p>
<p> Religion and the Buddhist tradition were enlisted, too, emphasizing 
civic duty. This article was forwarded hundreds of thousands of times. <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/e4ruQmt91sQ46BR65OH4og">mp.weixin.qq.com/s/e4ruQmt91sQ4â€¦</a> "Buddha teaches us that we should create good karma. Preventing disease is also creating good karma." 32/ </p>
<p> Many millions of Chinese have not forgotten Dr. Li Wenliang who 
first sounded the alarm and was ignored and called before the police to 
be accused of "rumor mongering" (lest we forget the authoritarianism of 
China). He ultimately died of COVID19. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51403795">bbc.com/news/world-asiâ€¦</a> <span> 32/</span> </p>
<p> Thousands still comment on Wenliang's social media every day (<a href="https://www.weibo.com/u/1139098205?is_hot=1">weibo.com/u/1139098205?iâ€¦</a>).
 His last message was that he tested positive for COVID19. People share 
what they are doing, as if Wenliang were still alive; they say good 
night/good morning to Wenliang every day. <span> 33/</span> </p>
<p> How Beijing reframed the coronavirus narrative. Iâ€™ve been very 
clear re Chinaâ€™s government being authoritarian and its failings. But 
COVID19 control was dramatic. <a href="https://twitter.com/gideonrachman">@gideonrachman</a> doesnâ€™t spare our political leaders either. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/20ab52d8-676a-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3?campaign=march20&amp;segmentID=09d3ed8b-33db-132b-eb60-c9f2617cc2e5">ft.com/content/20ab52â€¦</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/FinancialTimes">@financialtimes</a> (not 34:) <span> /35</span> </p>

<p class="rm-manual">For a contrarian take on the worldwide response to COVID19 by a very smart scientist, John Ioannidis <a href="https://twitter.com/Stanford">@Stanford</a>, who argues we may be (and perhaps are) over-reacting, see: <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/">statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fâ€¦</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/jflier">@jflier</a> <span> 1/</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual">He rightly points out that we are making huge 
decisions with crappy data, and he is right that we should (immediately)
 put into place surveillance for COVID19. Many smart scientists are 
working full time to assemble such data and fill in holes in data we 
have. <span> 2/</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual">Given all the data uncertainties, reasonable 
estimates for the case fatality ratio (CFR) of COVID19 in the general 
U.S. population could be between 0.05% (half as deadly as the flu) to 1%
 (ten times as deadly as the flu), according to Ioannidis! That's a huge
 range. <span> 3/</span></p>

<p class="rm-manual">Flu pandemics recur reliably but unpredictably 
every decade or so, and their extent and intensity varies. With COVID19,
 we may be in midst of a once-every-50-years event, perhaps similar to 
1957 pandemic, but not as bad as the 1918 pandemic. Letâ€™s talk about 
the 1957 pandemic. <span> 1/</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual">Pandemics result from emergence of viral strains 
that are novel, often from genetic recombination in animal reservoirs. 
The 1957 pandemic was due to influenza A (H2N2). <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/types.htm">cdc.gov/flu/about/viruâ€¦</a> "Serological archeology" suggests it resembled 1889 strain. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8877331">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8877331</a> <span> 2/</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual">The virus that caused the 1957 pandemic is a 
different from the coronavirus causing COVID19. Both are rhinoviruses, 
but from different phyla. <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/03/who-coronavirus-different-than-influenza-can-be-contained/">statnews.com/2020/03/03/whoâ€¦</a> Despite the different pathogens, we can still understand what is happening by studying past pandemics. <span> 3/</span></p>
