<p>(Washington D.C.) — President Donald Trump has fired the State 
Department’s inspector general, an Obama administration appointee whose 
office was critical of alleged political bias in the agency’s 
management. The ouster is the latest in a series of moves against 
independent executive branch watchdogs who have found fault with the 
Trump administration.</p>
<p>A senior department official said Trump removed Steve Linick from his
 job on Friday but gave no reason for his ouster. In a letter to 
Congress, Trump said Linick, who had held the job since 2013, no longer 
had his full confidence and that his removal would take effect in 30 
days. Trump did not mention Linick by name in his letter.</p>
<p>Democrats in Congress immediately cried foul, with the chairman of 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee suggesting that Linick was fired in 
part in retaliation for opening an unspecified investigation into 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p>
<p>“This firing is the outrageous act of a president trying to protect 
one of his most loyal supporters, the secretary of state, from 
accountability,” Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said in a statement. “I have 
learned that the Office of the Inspector General had opened an 
investigation into Secretary Pompeo. Mr. Linick’s firing amid such a 
probe strongly suggests that this is an unlawful act of retaliation.”</p>
<p>Engel offered no details of the alleged investigation into Pompeo, 
although two congressional aides said the probe involved allegations 
that Pompeo may have improperly treated staff. Linick’s office has 
issued several reports critical of the department’s handling of 
personnel matters during the Trump administration, including accusing 
some of political appointees of retaliating against career officials.</p>
<p>“If Inspector General Linick was fired because he was conducting an 
investigation of conduct by Secretary Pompeo, the Senate cannot let this
 stand,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. “The Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee must get to bottom of what happened here.”</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also condemned Linick’s ouster, saying he 
had been “punished for honorably performing his duty to protect the 
Constitution and our national security.”</p>
<p>“The president must cease his pattern of reprisal and retaliation 
against the public servants who are working to keep Americans safe, 
particularly during this time of global emergency.”</p>
<p>Linick, whose office also took issue with former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she served as 
America’s top diplomat, played a minor role in the Ukraine impeachment 
investigation into Trump.</p>

<p class="">In October, Linick turned over documents to House 
investigators that he had received from State Department’s Counselor T. 
Ulrich Brechbuhl, a close Pompeo associate, which contained information 
from debunked conspiracy theories about Ukraine’s role in the 2016 
election.</p>
<p class="">Linick will replaced by Stephen Akard, a former career 
foreign service officer who has close ties to Vice President Mike Pence,
 said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter 
publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Akard currently runs the 
department’s Office of Foreign Missions. He had been nominated to be the
 director general of the foreign service but withdrew after objections 
he wasn’t experienced enough.</p>
<p class="">Linick, a former assistant U.S. attorney in California and 
Virginia, had overseen inspector general reports that were highly 
critical of the department’s management policies during the Trump 
administration. His office had criticized several Trump appointees for 
their treatment of career staff for apparently being insufficiently 
supportive of Trump and his policies.</p>
<p class="">Under Linick, the State Department’s inspector general 
office was also critical of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s 
hiring freeze and attempts to streamline the agency by slashing its 
funding and personnel.</p>
<p class="">Trump has been taking aim lately at inspectors general.</p>
<p>In April, he fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the 
intelligence community, for his role in the whistleblower complaint that
 led to Trump’s impeachment.</p>
<p>Then Trump removed Glenn Fine as acting inspector general at the 
Defense Department, a move that stripped him of his post as chairman of 
the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.</p>
<p>During a White House briefing on COVID-19, Trump questioned the 
independence of an inspector general of the Department of Health and 
Human Services over a report that said there was a shortage of supplies 
and testing at hospitals.</p>
