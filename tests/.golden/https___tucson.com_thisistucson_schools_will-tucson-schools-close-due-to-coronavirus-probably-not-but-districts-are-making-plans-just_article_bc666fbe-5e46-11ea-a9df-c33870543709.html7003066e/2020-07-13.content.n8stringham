<figcaption class="rm-manual"> <span> <span>Getty Images</span> </span> </figcaption><p>Tucson-area schools are working to create contingency plans in the unlikely event of school closures due to the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>In preparation for a possible COVID-19 epidemic, Pima County Health 
Department and education officials are focusing on hygiene and 
encouraging sick students and school staff to stay at home.</p>
<p>School closures could have severe and adverse effects. The economic 
and social disruption could be very large, says Health Department 
Interim Director Bob England.</p>
<p>“I am not planning on closing any schools,” he said. “I think it 
could be counterproductive. … I would probably put a whole bunch of kids
 a year behind because we’d be closing for the rest of spring.”</p>
<p>Closing schools could put parents and guardians who don’t have child 
care at risk of losing their jobs. A lack of income is one of the 
biggest factors affecting health, England says.</p>
<p>“You could easily do more harm than good by closing a bunch of schools,” he said.</p>
<p>England thinks the epidemic will pan out like the bad flu season two 
years ago, where 80,000 Americans died of flu and related complications.
 As of Tuesday, March 3, Arizona had two documented cases of COVID-19, 
both in Maricopa County.</p>
<p>Most schools already have an influenza pandemic plan ready to implement, England says.</p>
<p>Nationally, most districts already have plans to deal with natural 
disasters, flu outbreaks and other emergencies, and many have planned 
for widespread infections before, most notably during the 2009 H1N1 
influenza pandemic. But most have never faced the prospect of closing 
for weeks at a time, as has happened in China and other countries 
working to prevent the virus from spreading.</p>
<p>The virus prompted Japan’s prime minister to ask all of the nation’s 
schools to close for a month as officials work to control the spread of 
the new virus in the country.</p>
<p>Pima County officials sent letters to all district and charter 
schools, as well as a number of private schools, with basic information 
on the virus and how to reduce risk of spread.</p>
<p>The virus primarily spreads like a common cold or flu. Health 
officials recommend that schools encourage thorough hand washing, 
covering coughs and staying at home when not feeling well, as well as 
routinely disinfecting high-touch surfaces like doorknobs and having a 
plan for if school closures do occur.</p>
<p>That plan should include addressing food insecurity for students who 
rely on schools for breakfast or lunch, identifying at-home learning 
opportunities and assuring that guardians who can’t take time off work 
have a plan to care for their children.</p>
<p>Tucson’s largest school district, TUSD, is finalizing a plan for 
potential school closures, which it will tentatively share at the March 
25 governing board meeting, said TUSD Superintendent Gabriel Trujillo.</p>
<p>A large component of the plan was employed during the Red for Ed 
teacher walkouts, including making sure any missed instruction was 
tracked and made up for if necessary and that there were frequent and 
widespread updates on the status of the closure, Trujillo said.</p>
<p>TUSD did cancel a student summer trip to South Korea because of the 
new coronavirus, due to travel warnings from the U.S. Department of 
State and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Vail School District had to cancel a student trip as well. The tour 
company working with the district gave the 22 Empire High School 
students, who already paid $3,750 each for a spring break trip to Japan,
 vouchers for future trips, said Vail spokeswoman Darcy Mentone.</p>
<p>Vail is also identifying alternative learning locations in the event 
they need to separate vulnerable children who could be more susceptible 
to viruses, the same way the district did during a whooping cough 
outbreak eight years ago, Mentone said.</p>
<p>But primarily, like all the local districts, Vail is focusing on common-sense measures of not contracting and spreading illness.</p>
<p>“It’s cold and flu season already,” Mentone said. “We go through this
 every year, so this year, we’re just redoubling our efforts.”</p>
<p>In the Tanque Verde School District, on top of hand washing and 
recommending the use of hand sanitizer, the district will be sanitizing 
shared classroom technology, door knobs, light switches and classroom 
faucet handles daily, said spokeswoman Claire Place. They will disinfect
 buses twice daily. The district will also discontinue attendance awards
 for the duration of the threat.</p>
<p>Marana Unified is reevaluating programs such as attendance awards and
 has also added additional disinfectant cleaning measures, says 
spokeswoman Tamara Crawley.</p>
<p>Catalina Foothills Schools are taking the same heightened hygiene and
 sanitation measures and are also prepared to postpone or cancel large 
school events, increase space between students in classrooms, limit 
access to campus by nonessential visitors, temporarily dismiss students 
from school, and accommodate vulnerable staff and students with 
alternative class space or working from home if possible, says 
spokeswoman Julie Farbarik.</p>
<p>Understanding of the virus is still in the early stages.</p>
<p>Although we know the virus is very contagious, it’s “almost 
certainly” less deadly than the current statistics show, England says. 
He explains that health organizations, nationally and internationally, 
don’t have the capabilities to screen a lot of people. Therefore, there 
are probably many mild cases that go unreported, making the actual death
 rate lower than current estimates.</p>
<p>The virus seems to have a minimal impact on children, said Arizona Schools Chief Kathy Hoffman in a letter to school leaders.</p>
<p>“The elderly and those with compromised immune systems are most 
at-risk,” she said. “Nevertheless, in order to keep our schools and 
students healthy, we, as always, recommend that students and staff with 
respiratory symptoms or illness stay at home.”</p>
