<p class="rm-manual">6 Min Read</p>
<p>BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Deaths from China’s new flu-like virus 
rose to 17 on Wednesday, with more than 540 cases confirmed, leading the
 city at the centre of the outbreak to close transportation networks and
 urge citizens not to leave as fears rose of the contagion spreading. </p>
<p>The previously unknown coronavirus strain is believed to have emerged
 from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in the central city 
of Wuhan. Cases have been detected as far away as the United States. </p>
<p>Contrasting with its secrecy over the 2002-03 Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people, China’s 
communist government has this time given regular updates to try to avoid
 panic as millions travel for the Lunar New Year. </p>
<p>After a meeting at its Geneva headquarters on Wednesday, the World 
Health Organization (WHO) said it would decide on Thursday whether to 
declare the outbreak a global health emergency, which would step up the 
international response. </p>
<p>If it does so, it will be the sixth international public health emergency to be declared in the last decade. </p>
<p>“This is an evolving and complex situation,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. </p>
<p>As it seeks to stop the spread of the virus, Wuhan’s local government
 said it would close all urban transport networks and suspend outgoing 
flights from the city as of 10 a.m. on Thursday (0200 GMT), state media 
reported, adding that the government said citizens should not leave the 
city unless there were special circumstances. </p>
<p>The measure was intended to “effectively cut off the transmission of 
the virus, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and ensure the 
health and safety of the people,” state media cited Wuhan’s virus 
task-force as saying. </p>

<p>Wuhan’s move was praised by Ghebreyesus as a “very strong” measure that could minimize the risk of contagion. </p>
<p>“If Wuhan is taking such drastic measures, we must assume widespread 
community transmission in this central China megacity &amp; transport 
hub,” Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University 
Law School in Washington, wrote in a tweet. </p>
<p>With more than 11 million people, Wuhan is central China’s main 
industrial and commercial centre, home to the country’s largest inland 
port and gateway to its Three Gorges hydroelectric dam. </p>
<p>The latest death toll in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the 
capital, rose to 17 by midday on Wednesday, state television quoted the 
provincial government as saying. </p>
<p>However, the virus has already spread beyond the city to population centres including Beijing, Shanghai, Macau and Hong Kong. </p>
<p>The official China Daily newspaper said 544 cases had now been 
confirmed in the country. Thailand has confirmed four cases, while the 
United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have each reported one. </p>
<p>Britain advised its citizens against all but essential travel to Wuhan. </p>
<p>Many Chinese were cancelling trips, buying face masks, avoiding 
public places such as cinemas and shopping centres, and even turning to 
an online plague simulation game as a way to cope. </p>

<p>“The best way to conquer fear is to confront fear,” said one commentator on China’s Twitter-like Weibo. </p>
<h3>RESPIRATORY THREAT </h3>
<p>China’s National Health Commission Vice Minister Li Bin said the 
virus, which can cause pneumonia and has no effective vaccine, was being
 spread via breathing. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty 
breathing. </p>
<p>“I feel fearful, because there’s no cure for the virus,” said Fu 
Ning, a 36-year-old woman in Beijing. “You have to rely on your immunity
 if you get an infection. It sounds very scary.” </p>
<p>The WHO’s head of emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, said the priority
 was to find the roots of how the virus was passing between people. </p>
<p>Fears of a pandemic initially spooked markets but they regained their
 footing on Wednesday, with investors citing the robust response from 
authorities as reassuring. </p>
<p>But companies with operations in China, from Foxconn to Huawei 
Technologies and HSBC Holdings, warned staff to avoid Wuhan and handed 
out masks. </p>
<p>The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said in
 a risk assessment that further global spread of the virus was likely. 
“The likelihood of case importation is highest in countries with the 
greatest volume of people travelling to and from Wuhan,” the ECDC’s 
director Andrea Ammon said in a statement. </p>
<p class="">Airports globally stepped up screening from China. </p>

 strengthened its sanitary and quarantine controls, and Singapore and 
Saudi Arabia started screening all passengers from China. </p>
<p>The Chinese-ruled gambling hub of Macau confirmed its first case of 
pneumonia linked to the coronavirus and tightened body-temperature 
screening measures. </p>
<p>A first case emerged in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, media reported, with
 the patient arriving via high-speed railway from the mainland, and 
Mexico was investigating a potential case. </p>
<p>North Korea banned foreign tourists, several foreign tour operators 
said. Some qualifying boxing matches for the 2020 Olympics set for Wuhan
 were cancelled and women’s football qualifiers were shifted to Nanjing.
