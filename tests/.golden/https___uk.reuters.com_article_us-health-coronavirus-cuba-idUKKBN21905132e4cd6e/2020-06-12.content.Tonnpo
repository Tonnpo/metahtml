<p>HAVANA (Reuters) - Communist-run Cuba said it dispatched a brigade of
 doctors and nurses to Italy for the first time this weekend to help in 
the fight against the novel coronavirus at the request of the 
worst-affected region Lombardy. </p>
<p>The Caribbean island has sent its “armies of white robes” to disaster
 sites around the world largely in poor countries since its 1959 
revolution. Its doctors were in the front lines in the fight against 
cholera in Haiti and against ebola in West Africa in the 2010s. </p>
<p>Yet with the 52-strong brigade, this is the first time Cuba has sent 
an emergency contingent to Italy, one of the world’s richest countries, 
demonstrating the reach of its medical diplomacy. </p>
<p>This is the sixth medical brigade Cuba has sent in recent days to 
combat the spread of the new disease abroad. It has sent contingents to 
socialist allies Venezuela and Nicaragua as well as Jamaica, Suriname 
and Grenada. </p>
<p>“We are all afraid but we have a revolutionary duty to fulfill, so we
 take out fear and put it to one side,” Leonardo Fernandez, 68, an 
intensive care specialist, told Reuters late on Saturday shortly before 
his brigade’s departure. </p>
<p>“He who says he is not afraid is a superhero, but we are not superheros, we are revolutionary doctors.” </p>
<p>Fernandez said this would be his eighth international mission, including one in Liberia during the fight against ebola. </p>
<p>Italy is the country that has been worst affected by the highly 
contagious virus that originated in China, with the northern region of 
Lombardy bearing the brunt of the contagion. </p>

<p>Its death toll rose on Saturday by 546 to 3,095, according to its 
head of welfare, Giulio Gallera, who requested the Cuban doctors. </p>
<p>We are going to fulfill an honorable task, based on the principle of solidarity,” said Graciliano Díaz, 64. </p>
<p>Cuba built a healthcare system that was the envy of the developing 
world with economic aid from former ally Soviet Union, though some of 
those advances have been lost since the communist bloc collapsed. </p>
<p>Many Cuban hospitals have fallen into disrepair and Cubans say they 
have difficulty finding medicine, a situation the government says is 
largely due to decades-old U.S. sanctions although analysts blame also 
the inefficient state-run economy. </p>
<p>Still, Cuba has one of the highest ratios worldwide of physicians per
 capita even when excluding those doctors abroad, and its medical 
brigades for disaster relief continue to earn Havana goodwill worldwide.
 </p>
<p>“In a time of crisis, the Cuban government, the Cuban people ... have
 risen to the occasion, they have heard our appeal and they have 
responded,” Jamaican Health Minister Christopher Tufton said on Saturday
 upon greeting 140 Cuban medical professionals at Kingston international
 airport. </p>
<p>Britain also thanked Cuba last week for allowing a British cruise 
ship that had been turned away by several Caribbean ports to dock on the
 island and for enabling the evacuation of the more than 600 passengers 
onboard. [nL1N2BB1ZQ] </p>
<p class="">Meanwhile Cuba, which is known for its disaster 
preparedness, is stepping up measures at home too to stem the 
coronavirus contagion. Twenty-five cases have been confirmed so far.

 Miguel Diaz-Canel announced late on Friday the country would be closing

one of the motors of its cash-strapped economy, tourism. </p>
<p>Thousands of doctors and medicine students are also going door-to-door monitoring their local communities. </p>
