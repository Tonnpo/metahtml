<p>TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday 
promised an unprecedented package of steps to cushion the world’s 
third-biggest economy from the coronavirus pandemic, saying the country 
was close to a national emergency as infections surged. </p>

Japan's response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, at his 
official residence in Tokyo, Japan, March 28, 2020. REUTERS/Issei Kato</span></p>
<p>Abe said the “huge, powerful” measures will include fiscal stimulus, 
monetary steps and tax breaks for companies, though the details have not
 been finalised. </p>
<p>“We are in a critical stage. We need to be ready for a long-term 
battle,” Abe said in a nationally televised news conference, adding: “I 
want to be straightforward about that.” </p>
<p>Infections in Japan have climbed to more than 1,500, with 52 deaths, 
excluding those from a cruise ship quarantined last month, according to 
public broadcaster NHK. </p>
<p>Officials confirmed a further 63 cases in Tokyo and on Saturday 
announced 57 new coronavirus cases at a center for the disabled in Chiba
 prefecture near the capital, NHK said. </p>
<p>Hit early by the coronavirus in its initial spread from China, Japan 
had seen a more gradual rise than the recent surge in much of Europe and
 the United States that has led to lockdowns of billions of people 
around the world. </p>
<p>Abe held back from declaring a state of emergency though he announced
 plans to approve the drug Avigan that has proved helpful in treatment. </p>
<p>“The pandemic is inflicting extremely big damage to Japan’s economy,”
 he said. “We’ll deploy a huge, powerful package that will include a 
full range of fiscal, monetary and tax measures.” </p>
<p>The size of the package will exceed that compiled in response to the 
global financial crisis of 2008, which was worth a total 57 trillion yen
 ($528 billion), Abe said. </p>
<p>The government will come up with a supplementary budget within ten 
days and try to get it through parliament at the earliest date possible,
 he said. </p>
<p>Part of the measures will include arrangements so that “small and 
midsized companies can borrow at zero interest from private financial 
institutions,” he said. </p>
<p>“We will also create a new scheme to offer cash payouts,” he added, 
saying this would be directed at households and companies that need it 
the most. </p>
<h3>TOKYO CLAMPDOWN </h3>
<p>Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike earlier issued a plea following a surge 
in coronavirus infections this week that she said put Tokyo on the brink
 of an emergency. </p>

<ul class="rm-manual"><li class="rm-manual"><a href="file:///article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-disabled/japan-confirms-57-new-coronavirus-cases-at-chiba-center-for-disabled-nhk-idUKKBN21F0HK"><p class="rm-manual"><span>Japan confirms 57 new coronavirus cases at Chiba center for disabled: NHK</span></p></a></li></ul>
<p>She asked the tens of millions of people in the city and surrounding 
regions to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings until April 12, 
particularly this weekend. </p>
<p>Abe this week called the situation “a national crisis”. People in the
 Osaka area in western Japan have also been asked to stay at home. </p>
<p>While the current level of infection appears low for a city of nearly
 14 million, with many millions more living in surrounding suburbs, 
experts warn there is a high risk that the number of cases could spiral 
as authorities have been unable to track all the contacts of more than 
half of the latest cases. </p>
<p>Tokyo reported one more casualty on Saturday, marking a total 7 deaths in the region. </p>
<p>At the news conference Abe rejected assertions that Japan was hiding the true number of cases. </p>
<p>The government has deployed the military to greater Tokyo’s Narita 
and Haneda airports to assist in virus screenings and the transport of 
people placed in quarantine, NHK said. </p>
<p>Calls for people to stay at home voluntarily compare with more 
rigorous lockdowns in Italy, Britain, France, Spain, and the United 
States - the new global epicenter of the virus. </p>
<p>Globally, infections have topped half a million with more than 20,000
 deaths, with the contagion affecting more than 100 countries. </p>
<p>Abe is expected to order economic steps including $135 billion or 
more in spending, government officials and lawmakers say, joining 
policymakers globally trying to blunt a downturn. </p>
<p>In a quiet neighborhood close to the prime minister’s private 
residence in central Tokyo, the scene was typical of a Saturday morning.
 Some people were jogging and walking their dogs. A few stopped to pray 
at a local shrine. </p>
<p>“I’m a little worried, but I have an appointment today, which is why 
I’m outside,” said a 41-year old man walking down the street, who 
declined to be named. </p>
<p>“It’s not something that I can’t cancel, but I do have to meet someone. I will be riding the train later.” </p>
<p>Some department stores, movie theaters, museums and parks closed, but
 many supermarkets and convenience stores were open as usual. </p>
<p>In Setagaya, a popular residential area in western Tokyo, many 
restaurants and shops were shut, although those that were open were 
doing brisk business, including an Italian restaurant that was filled 
with some young families and older couples. </p>
