<h3 class="rm-manual">A user has posted a classified document online 
relating to the Challenger 2 in order to improve the accuracy of the 
design of the tank in combat game ‘War Thunder’.</h3>
<p>A gamer identifying as Challenger 2 commander has posted a classified
 document online in order to improve the accuracy of the design of the 
tank in the game ‘War Thunder’.</p>
<p>War Thunder is a vehicular combat multiplayer video game developed 
and published by Gaijin Entertainment. Despite the fact that Gaijin 
Entertainment lists itself as a Cyprus-based studio, it was originally 
founded in Moscow, Russia, where it still has offices today.</p>
<p>It also has branches in Germany, Hungary, and Latvia, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/gaijin-entertainment-russia-anti-ukraine-sponsor/">you can read more on the studio here</a>.</p>
<h3>So, what happened?</h3>
<p>A user identifying as a Challenger 2 commander posted specific 
excerpts from a Challenger 2 AESP (Army Equipment Support Publication, 
sort of like a user manual) to show game developers that they “didn’t 
model it correctly”.</p>
<p>The user identifies as a make in Tidworth with a history of “Tanks 
&amp; AFV’s, CR2 Tank Commander, AFV Instr, D&amp;M Instr, Gunnery 
Instr, Former ATDU”. It should be noted that Tidworth is home to the 
Royal Tank Regiment who operate Challenger 2 tanks.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is understood that the excerpts from the document had 
their ‘UK RESTRICTED’ label crossed out and a stamp of ‘UNCLASSIFIED’ 
added, as well as having various parts fully blanked. One forum user 
remarked that “the cover for instance had basically everything except 
CHALLENGER 2 blacked out”.</p>
<p>The forum user posted the following alongside the now removed AESP in
 an effort to have an issue with the in-game design of the vehicle 
rectified.</p>
<p>“Linking those screenshots with the following edited image from the 
AESP’s which is meant to show the relationship of the various 
components. The image isn’t exactly to scale as its only meant to show 
the position of components relative to each other but it works for the 
point I’m trying to make here. The trunnion’s sit centrally of the 
rotor. The trunnions support the rotor in the turret structure and the 
GCE sub components as previously stated are all mounted to the rotor.”</p>
<p>Gaijin refused to deal with the apparently still classified documents. Saying through through their community manager:</p>
<p>“Before any discussion, handling or bug reports are even made, proof 
of this documents declassification will be required as well as where it 
was sourced form. If it is declassified, it should be available to the 
public. Last time such a document was shared that was claimed to be 
“unclassified” it was in fact still classified and was confirmed that it
 should never have been shared. We make it very clear that we will not 
handle any source material unless it is publically available and fully 
declassified with the rights to prove that.”</p>
<p>Additionally, a forum moderator posted:</p>
<p>“We have written confirmation from MoD that this document remains 
classified. By continuing to disseminate it you are in violation of the 
Official Secrets Act as stated by the warning on the cover of the 
document, an offence which can carry up to a 14 year prison sentence if 
prosecuted. Of this you are already aware, as a service person you have 
signed a declaration that you understand the act and what actions it 
compels you to take. Every time you post this you place us 
(International representatives of Gaijin), especially any UK citizens, 
in hot water as the warning so helpfully states that unauthorised 
retention of a protected document is an offence.”</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear what happened – was the clearance faked or was it 
given by the wrong people? We’ll update htis article when we know more.</p>

 you need to take a look at yourself if you’re sending in an operators

<p class="rm-manual">The guy who posted it is a tank commander and has 
been gathering information for a long time and sone changes have come as
 a result. Everything he posts and collects he clears with his OC first 
and had quite a bit under review still. This article was so long ago and
 had been cleared by his superiors.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Yes agreed. This individual is obviously a security
 risk and has already given information to a possible future adversary. 
If they find hip he should de dismissed and charged under the OSA.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Both of you are making assumptions on misleading 
information. This was posted on the forums around 2 years ago and they 
claimed it was still classified but he had gotten it approved by his 
superiors first and continues to provide information they use today to 
make the fixes we keep getting to the chally.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Incorrect – you can look and see he *just* posted 
it two days ago, and you can see a developer response stating that they 
directly asked the MOD if this information was kosher and they in turn 
were directly told “No.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">It would have taken you five minutes to verify that you weren’t the one making assumptions on misleading information, my friend.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">As others have said, the future plan for British 
tanks is so small, it hardly matters. I’m more concerned about the 
British Government not funding defence properly. Thats the biggest 
security risk. The scary thing is, our fellow citizens elected these 
clowns.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">To be fare the Government have increased defence 
spending recently and we are the second biggest spender in NATO. I would
 like to see more spent on defence but at least we have reversed the 
direction of cut cut cut. Not everything can be funded and the future 
battlefield may be very different from now and what kit is required is 
likely to change. At one time a line of Dreadnaughts was the thing… in 
the future it might be AI controlled stealth drones. The traditional 
tank as we know it today may not be as much of a player<span><span>… </span><span>Read more »</span></span></p>

<p class="rm-manual">Indeed I’m not sure despite my contempt for Boris’s
 Buffoons that any alternative Govt would have increased defence 
spending, indeed had Corbyn been elected we would have bikes in place of
 tanks. Again I agree the effectiveness of tanks esp past this decade is
 very much up for debate it needs a serious conflict to truly judge, I 
wonder how long battleships would have lasted had the 2nd WW not 
occurred maybe even into the 60s who knows and would the Aircraft 
Carrier still much doubted by some in 1939 gained the impetus in the 40s
 and beyond? Tanks futures<span><span>… </span><span>Read more »</span></span></p>

<p class="rm-manual">$6 Billion USD for 250 tanks ? That seems steep to 
me. The UK are spending $1.1 Billion USD for 148 Challenger 3s. I wish 
we would upgrade more, even if we put the additional tanks in storage.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">@Jack you’ll probably find that the Poland deal 
includes a lot of other things that you need to operate a new tank, like
 spare parts, ammunition, crew training, maintenance tooling, etc</p>

<p class="rm-manual">We have to accept that Britain’s role in any war 
and especially in Europe won’t be at the head of mass tank battles. 
Other specialities are far more important for us and we can and should 
only expect a minor tank contribution as much as 300 or 400 would be 
ideal if we had the budget for it I agree. Fact is Poland, Central 
European powers and Germany and then France are by far those with 
highest priorities there. We would be better working on and offering

<p class="rm-manual">Its not clear yet where the mistake has been made. 
The guy that posted the excerpts has always maintained that they have 
been cleared. Someone has obviously made a mistake but it isn’t clear 
who it is yet, whether that be the guy on the forum or otherwise. It is 
probably best not to jump to the conclusion that this has been ‘leaked’ 
just yet.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Even if that stuff wasn’t “classified” his job is 
being a tanker in the British Army. Not trying to make a “game” more 
realistic. Jeez.</p>
