<p>A mammoth overview was just released by researchers from the China 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (their website is a bit slow 
right now so have patience).[1] It broke down important details of 
44,672 RT-PCR confirmed cases from among 72,314 unique records that 
spanned from close to the known start of the emergence in early 
December, to February 11, 2020.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve taken some of the key findings and put them into an infographic 
below. Keep in mind that although 80.9% of cases are described as mild, 
that leaves nearly a fifth (18.5%) of all cases in China defined as 
severe or critical. The critical group include all those who go on to 
die. Hospitalisation among more severe disease can last between 2 and 6 
weeks. It has been predicted via media reports that 60% or more of a 
population could be infected during the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 
(the virus; see below).</p>

 you‚Äôre here and because I really haven‚Äôt much time to spare for more 
blogs right now, let‚Äôs jam in a bit of info about the latest ‚Äì and 
hopefully last ‚Äì naming system so I have something to reference for 
people who ask.</p>
<h2>What‚Äôs in a coronavirus name?</h2>
<p>As we all now know and have committed to memory ‚Äì riiiiIIiight??? ‚Äì the virus and disease got new names on January 11th.</p>
<p>On February 12th AEST, the coronavirus first discovered in Wuhan, 
Hubei Province, China was at last given a permanent name. Up until then,
 it had simply been called a <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/">novel coronavirus (nCoV)</a> and then the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). </p>
<p class="">BREAKING: WHO has received the genetic sequences for the novel <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#coronavirus</a> (2019-nCoV) from the Chinese authorities. We expect them to be made publicly available as soon as possible. <a href="https://t.co/h1w7A0jBm2">pic.twitter.com/h1w7A0jBm2</a></p>
<p class="">‚Äî World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) </p>
<p class=""><a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1216108498188230657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2020</a></p>
<p>After lengthy consideration of the genetic sequence of the virus and 
how it related to already known coronaviruses, a specific coronavirus 
study group (CSG) from the International Committee on Taxonomy of 
Viruses (ICTV), the global authority on the designation and naming of 
viruses, designated this virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This will be the name used in all scientific
 literature from now on. </p>
<p>At the same time, the World Health Organization gave the disease in 
those infected by SARS-CoV-2 a distinct name as well, corona virus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19).[3-4] </p>
<p>These two names are not interchangeable as one names the infectious agent and the other the outcome from infection by it.</p>
