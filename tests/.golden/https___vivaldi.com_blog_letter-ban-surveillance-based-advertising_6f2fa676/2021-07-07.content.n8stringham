<h1 class="rm-manual">Open letter: Ban surveillance-based advertising</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">This letter has been sent by the undersigned to EU 
&amp; US regulators, to urge them to take action on banning 
surveillance-based ads, as recommended by the Norwegian Consumer 
Council.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Published on July 7, 2021 <span> – By</span> <a href="https://vivaldi.com/author/jonvt/" rel="author">Jon von Tetzchner</a><span> – <span>860 views</span></span></p>
<p class="rm-manual">Recently, the Norwegian Consumer Council published a
 report calling for a ban on surveillance-based ads. In solidarity, we 
the undersigned have sent the following letter on Wednesday, July 7th, 
to EU and US regulators to encourage them to take action during 
legislative sessions and any relevant privacy discussions.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">TIME TO BAN SURVEILLANCE-BASED ADVERTISING</h2>
<p>Surveillance-based advertising permeates the internet today, creating
 a number of highly problematic issues for both consumers and 
businesses.</p>
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/20210622-final-report-time-to-ban-surveillance-based-advertising.pdf">On June 23, a broad coalition</a>
 of consumer rights organizations, civil rights groups, NGOs, as well as
 academics, researchers, privacy experts, and enthusiasts – all 
concerned individuals – called on regulators to stop the invasive and 
privacy-hostile practices related to surveillance-based advertising.</p>
<p>In the EU, they urged regulators to consider a ban on 
surveillance-based advertising as a part of the Digital Services Act. In
 the U.S., they urged legislators to enact comprehensive privacy 
legislation. We are a group of businesses who write to you today to show
 our support to this initiative. We represent small, medium, and large 
businesses who all believe – and demonstrate on a daily basis – that it 
is possible to run profitable companies without exploiting the privacy 
of individuals.</p>
<p>In addition to the clear privacy issues caused by surveillance-based 
advertising, it is also detrimental to the business landscape.</p>
<p>In the surveillance-based advertising model, a few actors can obtain 
competitive advantages by collecting data from across websites and 
services and dominant platform actors can abuse their positions by 
giving preference to their own services.</p>
<p>These practices seriously undermine competition and take revenue away
 from content creators. Anti-competitive behavior and effects serve to 
entrench dominant actors’ positions while complex supply chains and 
ineffective technologies lead to lost revenues for advertisers and 
publishers.</p>
<p>It is also difficult for consumers to distinguish between ‘good’ and 
‘bad’ actors in the digital sphere, which means that legitimate actors, 
amongst them many small and medium-sized enterprises, are directly 
affected by the actions of unscrupulous companies.</p>
<p>This harms consumers and businesses and can undermine the cornerstones of democracy.</p>
<p>Although we recognize that advertising is an important source of 
revenue for content creators and publishers online, this does not 
justify the massive commercial surveillance systems set up in attempts 
to “show the right ad to the right people”.</p>
<p>Other forms of advertising technologies exist, which do not depend on
 spying on consumers, and alternative models can be implemented without 
significantly affecting revenue. On the contrary – and that we can 
attest to – businesses can thrive without privacy-invasive practices.</p>
<p>We encourage you to take a stand and ban surveillance-based advertising.</p>
<p>With kind regards, </p>
