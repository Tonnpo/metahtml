<p class="rm-manual">On 9 May, Europe Day, the Citizens Take Over Europe
 alliance launches its Assembly, a citizens’ conversation on the future 
of Europe. The Assembly is necessary because civil society has been 
sidelined from the Conference on the Future of Europe promoted by the 
European Union, explain the representatives of the initiative, Marta 
Cillero, Michele Fiorillo and Martin Pairet.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Voxeurop: What are the ambitions of the citizen-led
 initiative “Citizens Take Over Europe” in relation to the Conference on
 the future of Europe? Why did you feel the need to create it? Wasn’t 
the Conference on the Future of Europe enough?</p>
<p>Michele Fiorillo: The Covid19 crisis has transformed a tragic global 
pandemic into a new systemic crisis of the European Union. The 
Conference on the Future of Europe, supposed to be launched in Dubrovnik
 on 9th of May, had to be postponed to a date still unknown. In any 
case, there was no institutional agreement between the Commission, 
Parliament and European Council about the scope, methodology or 
objectives of this Conference. Based on what had been proposed by these 
institutions, many civil society organizations <a href="https://voxeurop.eu/en/2020/conference-future-europe-5124320">were already criticizing</a>
 the structure of the Conference and its methodology, for giving civil 
society only the most marginal of roles. None of the inspiring 
participative and citizen-led methodologies used with success in Ireland
 or Belgium recently, for example, were taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Our ambition with the <a href="https://citizenstakeover.eu/">Citizens Take Over Europe</a>
 alliance is to demonstrate that we are ready to take the lead and have a
 say about our future, putting citizens and residents at the centre of 
the conversation about the future of Europe. And not only that: we 
believe it is crucial for people in Europe to organise across borders to
 push forwards the Europe we want: a Europe that cares and is taken care
 of.</p>
<p>Is it the beginning of a long-term process led by civil society? Could you describe it?</p>
<p>Michele Fiorillo: The 9th of May will be the first step for the 
opening of a transnational public space. A Citizens Conference on the 
Future of Europe, in the form of a European Citizens Assembly, could be a
 powerful instrument to organize this civic mobilization. Experiences 
like the Irish Citizens’ Assembly or G1000 have shown how citizens could
 powerfully deliberate together for the common good. On the 9th of May 
we will issue our grassroots “Schuman declaration”, kicking-off a 
process for a self-organised European Citizens’ Conference to be built 
and take place over at least the coming 2 years, in which people can 
have a say about our present and future. We have to ensure that citizens
 and civil society participation are at the heart of all new initiatives
 for the future of Europe.</p>
<p>We need to introduce a fundamental and bottom-up energy to reimagine 
our relation to Europe at a moment when top-down governance is 
threatening the idea of European solidarity and risks dividing our 
societies even further. This process may lead also to the birth of a 
civic pouvoir constituant able to create a truly European demos – or 
even a European nation – and ultimately a democratic EU constitution. To
 achieve all that we need our transnational ‘Tennis Court Oath’ of 
European citizens and organizations -maybe in alliance with the EU 
Parliament- willing to join this ambitious experiment. The moment is 
now.</p>
<p>How do you see the growing role of civil society groups in reshaping 
the presently fragile European project? What is their leverage?</p>
<p>Marta Cillero: The Citizens Take Over Europe alliance, and citizens 
all over Europe, have multiplied petitions, open letters and projects 
through the financial, migration and health crises. For the first time, 
our coalition has brought together European civil society organisations 
in an unprecedented way to challenge European institutions with our own 
plan for renewing democracy. Our role as transnational civil society is 
to launch our own process for the Future of Europe, amplifying often 
unheard and marginalised voices, which institutions and governments 
cannot ignore.</p>
<p>We need our own European Citizens’ Conference: a transnational 
assembly able to summon the vision and ambition that our leaders are 
dramatically failing to show. We believe the millions of European 
citizens and residents that are currently directly affected by the 
Covid-19 pandemia see the direct impact of the lack of solidarity 
between European Member-states. Organised civil society has the 
responsibility to open up political space to address the direct concerns
 of people in Europe, and we believe now is the right time to demand the
 appropriate channel to the institutions to ensure people are always at 
the centre of decision making.</p>
<p>Are they working beside political parties or sometimes hand-in-hand? What are their relays with the political world?</p>
<p>Marta Cillero: Civil society groups need to work beside political 
parties to preserve their role as counter power to traditional 
governance structures as well as their capacity to critique government‘s
 accountability to citizens needs. Our mission is also to propose 
alternatives to citizens on how to better govern ourselves, create the 
conditions for decision making that puts citizens and residents of 
Europe at the centre. Relays and allies in the political world are 
essential to reach our goals: we need to work with traditional 
structures of power to set the basis for a genuinely participatory 
democracy in Europe. However, often, civil society endeavours for change
 are at risk of being instrumentalized, and be a token for many 
political parties and governments to legitimate their actions. In 
France, for example, where a truly participatory Citizens Conference on 
Climate Change (<a href="https://www.conventioncitoyennepourleclimat.fr/">Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat</a>) took place until April 2020, it is still yet <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/sante/maladie/coronavirus/tribune-nouslespremiers-elus-personnalites-publiques-ou-citoyens-ils-s-adressent-a-emmanuel-macron-pour-dessiner-le-monde-dapres_3937031.html">unsure</a>
 if the policies the citizens articulated will actually be turned into 
reality. As civil society actors, we have to be always aware of this 
tension when working with traditional politics.</p>
<p>Civil society is weakly anchored in the European Union 
decision-making system, and easily ignored: that is why it is so 
important that we use this unprecedented crisis to create a unity 
between many dispersed civil society actors across Europe, and take the 
initiative to organise in ways that cannot be bypassed.</p>
<p>How effective are their actions and proposals to revive the values of
 cooperation, equality and solidarity, initially at the heart of the 
original European project?</p>
<p>Martin Pairet: In the crises of the past decades, European politics 
has failed to organize solidarity with the most marginalised, Roma, 
migrants and other European citizens alike. Too often, as civil society 
actors, we hear the argument that this failure is due to the lack of 
competency of the European institutions over certain areas like 
migration or health. But, often, alternative solutions do exist, and 
could be promoted, and ball-passing between national governments, and 
European institutions is no way of escaping responsibility. Millions of 
people have organized across borders to support the most marginalized in
 our societies and developed alternative governance platforms locally 
that reinvent the way we live and take decisions about our lives. Their 
actions have proven that alternatives are possible and are already 
implemented by citizens themselves.</p>
<p>How did those values get lost and why did the top-down governance 
failed to meet the needs of Europeans? Could civil society manage to 
strengthen a fragilized democracy in a growing number of Member states?</p>
<p>Michele Fiorillo: The European project has been stuck for more than a
 decade. Conflicting “raison d’Etats” are blocking the EU Council, and 
so the Union cannot deliver as it could with a more democratic, 
transnational governance looking at the European people as a whole. We 
have a common market, but not a common social policy for all the 
continent, and this is undermining the legitimacy of the EU, fostering 
the national-populistic forces. Without the building up of a civic 
transnational counter-power able to make pressure on the Council and the
 other institutions, Europe will not make further decisive steps towards
 the needed direction.</p>
<p>No single State will save itself from a catastrophe of the Covid19 
Crisis if it will not act together with the others in cooperation to 
move towards a stronger Union, and the European Union will be unable to 
fulfil its global responsibilities of solidarity with other countries if
 it acts in a divided and beggar-thy-neighbour manner. We believe that 
this is something that European citizens are everyday more aware of. And
 we are sure that Europe will change and become more democratic, free 
and equal, also through the bottom-up process we are inviting everyone 
to join and shape together with us a permanent transnational European 
public space for deliberation and citizen participation.</p>
