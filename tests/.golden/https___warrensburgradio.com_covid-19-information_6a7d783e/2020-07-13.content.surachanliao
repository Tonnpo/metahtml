</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html#">Who is at Higher Risk?</a></h2>
<p>Early information out of China, where COVID-19 first started, shows 
that some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this 
illness. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Older adults</li>
<li>People who have serious chronic medical conditions like:<ul>
<li>Heart disease</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Lung disease</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a COVID-19 outbreak happens in your community, it could last for a
 long time. (An outbreak is when a large number of people suddenly get 
sick.) Depending on how severe the outbreak is, public health officials 
may recommend community actions to reduce people’s risk of being exposed
 to COVID-19. These actions can slow the spread and reduce the impact of
 disease.</p>
<p>If you are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 because 
of your age or because you have a serious long-term health problem, it 
is extra important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of 
getting sick with the disease.</p>
<h2> Get Ready for COVID-19 Now</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have supplies on hand<ul>
<li>Contact your healthcare provider to ask about obtaining extra 
necessary medications to have on hand in case there is an outbreak of 
COVID-19 in your community and you need to stay home for a prolonged 
period of time.</li>
<li>If you cannot get extra medications, consider using mail-order for medications.</li>
<li>Be sure you have over-the-counter medicines and medical supplies 
(tissues, etc.) to treat fever and other symptoms. Most people will be 
able to recover from COVID-19 at home.</li>
<li>Have enough household items and groceries on hand so that you will be prepared to stay at home for a period of time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Take everyday precautions<ul>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
<li>Take everyday preventive actions<ul>
<li>Clean your hands often</li>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, 
especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing, or having 
been in a public place.</li>
<li>If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
<li>To the extent possible, avoid touching high-touch surfaces in public
 places – elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, handshaking with 
people, etc. Use a tissue or your sleeve to cover your hand or finger if
 you must touch something.</li>
<li>Wash your hands after touching surfaces in public places.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your face, nose, eyes, etc.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect your home to remove germs: practice routine 
cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs,
 light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks &amp; cell 
phones)</li>
<li>Avoid crowds, especially in poorly ventilated spaces. Your risk of 
exposure to respiratory viruses like COVID-19 may increase in crowded, 
closed-in settings with little air circulation if there are people in 
the crowd who are sick.</li>
<li>Avoid all non-essential travel including plane trips, and especially avoid embarking on <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/covid-19-cruise-ship">cruise ships</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, take extra measures to 
put distance between yourself and other people to further reduce your 
risk of being exposed to this new virus.<ul><li>Stay home as much as possible.<ul><li>Consider ways of getting food brought to your house through family, social, or commercial networks</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/get-your-household-ready-for-COVID-19.html">Have a plan for if you get sick:</a><ul>
<li>Consult with your health care provider for more information about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html#precautions">monitoring your health for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19</a>.</li>
<li>Stay in touch with others by phone or email. You may need to ask for
 help from friends, family, neighbors, community health workers, etc. if
 you become sick.</li>
<li>Determine who can provide you with care if your caregiver gets sick</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Watch for symptoms and emergency warning signs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pay attention for potential COVID-19 symptoms including, fever, 
cough, and shortness of breath. If you feel like you are developing 
symptoms, call your doctor.</li>
<li>If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately. In adults, emergency warning signs*:<ul>
<li>Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
<li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</li>
<li>New confusion or inability to arouse</li>
<li>Bluish lips or face</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider
 for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.What to Do if You 
Get Sick</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay home and call your doctor</li>
<li>Call your healthcare provider and let them know about your symptoms.
 Tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help them take 
care of you and keep other people from getting infected or exposed.</li>
<li>If you are not sick enough to be hospitalized, you can recover at home. Follow CDC instructions for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html">how to take care of yourself at home</a>.</li>
<li>Know when to get emergency help</li>
<li>Get medical attention immediately if you have any of the emergency warning signs listed above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Others can do to Support Older Adults</h2>
<h5>Community Support for Older Adults</h5>
<ul>
<li>Community preparedness planning for COVID-19 should include older 
adults and people with disabilities, and the organizations that support 
them in their communities, to ensure their needs are taken into 
consideration.<ul><li>Many of these individuals live in the community, 
and many depend on services and supports provided in their homes or in 
the community to maintain their health and independence.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Long-term care facilities should be vigilant to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/prevent-spread-in-long-term-care-facilities.html">Information for long-term care facilities can be found here.</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Family and Caregiver Support</h5>
<ul>
<li>Know what medications your loved one is taking and see if you can help them have extra on hand.</li>
<li>Monitor food and other medical supplies (oxygen, incontinence, dialysis, wound care) needed and create a back-up plan.</li>
<li>Stock up on non-perishable food items to have on hand in your home to minimize trips to stores.</li>
<li>If you care for a loved one living in a care facility, monitor the 
situation, ask about the health of the other residents frequently and 
know the protocol if there is an outbreak.</li>
