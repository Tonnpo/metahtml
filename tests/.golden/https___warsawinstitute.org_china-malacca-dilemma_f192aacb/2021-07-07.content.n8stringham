<h1 class="rm-manual">China and the “Malacca Dilemma”</h1>
<p>The Strait of Malacca is the shortest sea route between the Middle 
East and East Asia, helping to reduce the time and cost of 
transportation among Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Its strategic 
location makes it a vital waterway for hydrocarbon, container and bulk 
cargo shipment. According to the US Energy Information Agency (EIA), in 
2016, approximately 16 million barrels of crude oil and 3.2 million 
barrels of liquefied natural gas (LNG) were transported daily through 
the Strait. This is the second largest volume in the world after the 
Strait of Hormuz, connecting the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. </p>

<p>Like most Asian countries, China is heavily dependent on hydrocarbon 
imports. Apart from its main supplier and partner, Russia, other 
significant sellers are located in the Middle East or Africa. 
Consequently, more than 70% of the PRC’s petroleum and LNG exports is 
shipped through the Strait of Malacca, which makes it a crucial route 
from the standpoint of the China’s energy security policy. However, its 
importance is not limited to the transport of raw materials. According 
to calculations by the Center for Strategic and International Studies 
(CSIS), about 20% of global maritime trade and 60% of China’s trade 
flows are moved through the Strait and the South China Sea, making it 
the most important sea line of communication for the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>In November 2003, President Hu Jintao described China’s situation as 
the “Malacca Dilemma,” referring to the lack of alternatives and 
vulnerability to a naval blockade. The President suggested that “certain
 powers have all along encroached on and tried to control navigation 
through the [Malacca] Strait.” It is clear that the term “certain 
powers” refers to the United States and the ability of the US Navy to 
control the communication routes. This issue has been debated for years 
both in China and abroad, while authorities in Beijing have long sought 
to diversify energy sources and increase the share of renewable energy. 
An additional factor which worsens the situation of China is its 
deteriorating relationship with India as well as its ambitious naval 
modernization and development program. India’s location at the 
crossroads of the most important transport routes in the Indian Ocean is
 a strong asset in case of an armed conflict. The PRC’s dependence on 
maritime trade hinders a potential naval blockade of Taiwan. Cutting off
 the island from goods could be a prelude to an amphibious operation or a
 tool of political pressure on the authorities in Taipei. 
Simultaneously, however, undertaking such actions might lead to 
analogous ones by the US forces and their allies aimed against China.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, the issue of sea lines of communication 
(SLOCs) has been gaining importance in the strategic discourse of the 
Middle Kingdom. China’s 2015 military strategy stated that “the security
 of overseas interests concerning energy and resources, strategic SLOCs,
 as well as institutions, personnel and assets abroad, has become an 
imminent issue.” Moreover, the document stressed that “the traditional 
mentality that land outweighs sea must be abandoned, and great 
importance has to be attached to managing the seas and oceans and 
protecting maritime rights and interests.” Such declarations confirm 
that China’s military and political elites realize that the maritime 
domain will be crucial in the pursuit of Chinese security and superpower
 status. Operations of China, deprived of control over SLOCs and 
strategic depth, when compared to the US forces, will remain severely 
constrained. Overcoming the existing encirclement is a sine qua non 
condition for China if it wants to abandon the “partial” superpower 
status and become a full-fledged one. </p>

<p>Beijing’s concerns associated with the Malacca Strait and the South 
China Sea stem from the fact that the US Navy (7th and 5th Fleets), 
which operates in the Indo-Pacific and the Middle East, is the only 
force capable of ensuring the security of SLOCs stretching from the 
coast of Africa to East Asia. Since the time of Deng Xiaoping, China has
 been a “stowaway,” which benefited from America’s continued commitment 
to ensuring free navigation and security in Asian waters. As long as 
China focused on economic modernization and its military remained 
relatively weak, the role of the US Navy was seen as a constructive 
contribution to a positive international environment. This “strategic 
window of opportunity” allowed Chinese companies to achieve a remarkable
 commercial success and unprecedented integration into the global 
economy.</p>
<p>Chinese authorities are trying to mitigate the Malacca Dilemma by 
reducing dependence on energy imports from the Middle East. Beijing is 
trying to establish alternative land links and energy cooperation with 
Russia, Central Asia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and (still hypothetically) Iran
 and Turkey. Cooperation with Pakistan through the China-Pakistan 
Economic Corridor (CPEC) was perceived as an opportunity to gain an 
additional access point to the Indian Ocean through the construction of a
 new gas pipeline. However, the challenging topography of the Himalayan 
region and high transit costs make such investment unprofitable. 
Additionally, it is located in an unstable region, which is vulnerable 
to a potential attack in the event of a conflict with India. For years, 
the Chinese authorities have also been exploring the possibility of 
using the Northern Sea Route (NSR) to diversify trade routes, mainly 
with Europe and Russia. Yet, as a result of shipping restrictions 
associated with the ice cover, it still plays a marginal role and cannot
 be an alternative to the Indo-Pacific routes. The measures taken by the
 Chinese authorities are insufficient to drastically reduce the level of
 dependence on transport through the Malacca Strait. A potential 
solution to dependence on crude oil imports from the Persian Gulf would 
be to develop the renewable energy and electric-powered vehicles 
sectors. However, this process will require at least a few decades, 
which means that shipment through the Malacca Strait will remain a 
source of concern for Beijing and an instrument of informal US pressure 
for many years to come.</p>
