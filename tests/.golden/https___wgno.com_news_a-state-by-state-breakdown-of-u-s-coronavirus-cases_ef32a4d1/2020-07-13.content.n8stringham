<p class="rm-manual"> Posted: Mar 4, 2020 / 05:06 AM CST </p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span> / </span>Updated: Mar 4, 2020 / 05:06 AM CST </p>
<p>State governments are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/health/us-coronavirus-updates-tuesday/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">working to contain coronavirus cases</a> in the US, as federal officials say more testing for the virus will likely boost the number of positive cases.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, there were 126<a href="https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-03-20-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener"> cases across 13 states</a>,
 as well as 45 cases from individuals repatriated from the Diamond 
Princess cruise ship, the site of an outbreak and quarantine. Three 
other cases of the virus are people who were repatriated from China.</p>
<p>Still, officials insist that even if the number of cases continues to climb, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/health/coronavirus-symptoms-treatment/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">there is no need to panic</a>.</p>
<p>“The risk to the American people of the coronavirus remains low, 
according to all of the experts that we are working with across the 
government,” Vice President Mike Pence said in a Tuesday news 
conference.</p>
<p>Here are the cases in each state:</p>
<h3>Washington state: 27</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/health/us-coronavirus-cases-monday/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nine people have died in Washington state</a> — at least five of whom were in a long-term nursing facility in a suburb of Seattle.</p>
<p>At least 50 residents and staff members of the center were 
experiencing symptoms and were tested for the virus, King County health 
officer Jeffrey Duchin said Monday.</p>
<h3>California: 27</h3>
<p>California’s number of cases rose to 27 Tuesday, according to health 
officials, with Placer County and Contra Costa County each reporting a 
case.</p>
<p>The Contra Costa County patient was in critical condition Tuesday and
 under medical isolation, county health officials said in a news 
conference.</p>
<p>The patient, they said, had underlying health conditions and is 
completely separated from the public at a hospital within the county. 
The source of transmission is under investigation, but the patient had 
no known travel history nor contact with any confirmed cases, officials 
said.</p>
<p>About half of the state’s cases are travel-related and at least four are from an unknown origin, the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Department of Public Health said</a> earlier this week.</p>
<p>The country’s first case of unknown origin was a patient admitted to 
UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento in February who was tested days 
later as they didn’t fit existing CDC testing guidelines.</p>
<p>The case prompted testing guidelines from the CDC, broadening who should be tested for the virus.</p>
<h3>North Carolina: 1</h3>
<p>A North Carolina person tested presumptive positive for the virus 
after visiting a Washington state facility with a coronavirus outbreak, 
officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Wake County resident is in isolation at home, a news release from the North Carolina Governor’s Office said.</p>
<p>“Our task force and state agencies are working closely with local 
health departments, health care providers and others to quickly identify
 and respond to cases that might occur,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper 
said in a news release.</p>
<h3>Oregon: 3</h3>
<p>Clackamas County declared a state of emergency after two people 
tested presumptive positive, a Lake Oswego School District news release 
said.</p>
<p>A district employee and a family member, both Washington County residents, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-29-20-intl-hnk/h_78f03dea76578affcd843df67189e9b9" rel="noreferrer noopener">tested positive</a>.</p>
<p>The third case in the state was in Umatilla County, Oregon, officials
 said, adding it’s considered a presumptive case of community 
transmission.</p>
<p>The resident was at a youth basketball game last week, the Oregon Health Authority said in a news release.</p>
<p>“Athena-Weston School District officials have closed the gym and will
 conduct a deep cleaning out of an abundance of caution,” the release 
said. “The gym is physically detached from the rest of the school. 
Health officials do not consider the separate school building to pose 
any risk of exposure.”</p>
<h3>Illinois: 4</h3>
<p>A woman in her 70s was identified as the fourth coronavirus case in 
Illinois. The patient is also the spouse of the state’s third case, a 
man in his 70s, a statement from the Illinois Department of Public 
Health and Cook County Department of Public Health says.</p>
<p>Both are reported to be in good condition. The woman is quarantined at home and complying with guidance, the statement says.</p>
<p>The state’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/us/illinois-coronavirus-patients-discharge/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous two cases have both fully recovered</a>.</p>
<h3>Massachusetts: 2</h3>
<p>Officials have announced the second case in Massachusetts, a woman in her 20s who recently traveled to Italy on a school trip.</p>
<p>The woman did not show any symptoms, a news release from the state’s <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/first-presumptive-positive-case-of-covid-19-identified-by-massachusetts-state-public-health" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Public Health said</a>.</p>
<p>The patient is the state’s first presumptive positive case — yet to 
be confirmed by the CDC. In January, Massachusetts confirmed a man in 
his 20s living in Boston was carrying the virus.</p>
<p>The man had recently traveled to Wuhan, China, and sought medical 
help after his return, the department said. He remained in isolation 
while he was recovering.</p>
<h3>Florida: 3</h3>
<p>Two people <a href="https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-02-20-intl-hnk/h_a9552a4d65d739a3b0cc7129b933cb52" rel="noreferrer noopener">tested positive in Florida</a>,
 the state’s governor said, citing the CDC, and the state’s department 
of health announced a third case was presumptive positive.</p>
<p>The first is a man in his 60s who has pneumonia and is hospitalized 
in stable condition. It’s unknown how the man contracted the virus but 
he has been in isolation and will remain there until he is cleared by 
health officials, state Surgeon General Dr. Scott Rivkees said in<a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/03/030120-two-presumptive-positive-covid19-cases.pr.html" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a statement.</a></p>
<p>The second patient, a woman in her 20s, recently returned from northern Italy. The patient is stable and isolated at home.</p>
<p>Of the 23 people tested in the state, officials are still awaiting the results for six people, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said.</p>
<p>“I have been working with federal partners and our Department of 
Health to ensure that communities are ready to handle the challenges 
presented by COVID-19.” he said in a statement. “The dedicated 
professionals at our county health departments, as well as those working
 at local medical providers, are well equipped to address these and 
future cases.</p>
<h3>Georgia: 2</h3>
<p>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced Monday night <a href="https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-03-20-intl-hnk/h_c1c65875642e464684b075e94673fdc0" rel="noreferrer noopener">the state’s first two confirmed cases of the virus</a>, saying both patients are residents of the same household in Fulton County, the state’s most populous county.</p>
<p>One of the two returned from Milan, Italy, through Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, state officials said.</p>
<p>The patients were in isolation “with minimal symptoms” and were never
 hospitalized, Georgia Department of Public Health Commissioner Kathleen
 Toomey said in the news conference.</p>
<p>Kemp told residents to be cautious if they start experiencing potential symptoms.</p>
<p>“If you start feeling bad, don’t go out,” he said. “Call your doctor.”</p>
<p>Officials did not give the patients’ ages.</p>
<h3>Rhode Island: 2</h3>
<p>Rhode Island reported its first two presumptive positive cases from a
 group of patients who had recently traveled to Europe together. A third
 person is being tested, the State of Rhode Island Department of Public 
Health said.</p>
<p>The first two presumptive positive cases are a man in his 40s and a 
teenager, the department said. The person being tested is in her 30s.</p>
<p>The three were on a school trip, the department said, adding it was monitoring all 38 people who went on that same trip.</p>
<p>“They have been instructed to not go to school or work and to remain 
at home for these 14 days,” the department said in a news release.</p>
<h3>New York: 2</h3>
<p>New York has two cases: a 39-year-old health care worker who recently
 returned from Iran and a man in New Rochelle who works in Manhattan, 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. The woman is in home isolation with her husband,
 and the New Rochelle man is ill in the hospital, the governor said.</p>
<p>Disease detectives have identified the woman’s close contacts, while 
they are still investigating the man’s travel, which included no trips 
to China or any other country on the watch list, he said.</p>
<p>“We’re tracing that back now, but he did test positive and there’s no
 apparent connection so it would be what we call a community spread 
case,” Cuomo said.</p>
<p>Cuomo said the goal was to “test as many as you can” and isolate anyone who tests positive to reduce the spread.</p>
<p>“We will have more cases, we will have community spread. That is inevitable,” Cuomo said.</p>
<h3>Arizona: 2</h3>
<p>One patient identified to have coronavirus “has recovered and is no 
longer infected with the disease,” state Department of Health Services 
Director Dr. Cara Christ said Monday.</p>
<p>In Maricopa County, authorities said a man in his 20s has 
presumptively tested positive. He “is a known contact of a presumed 
positive case outside of Arizona,” and he is recovering at home, health 
officials said in a news release.</p>
<h3>New Hampshire: 2</h3>
<p>New Hampshire’s first presumptive positive case was an individual who
 had traveled to Italy recently, state epidemiologist Dr. Benjamin Chan 
said.</p>
<p>The second person had contact with the first, officials said. Both are now in home isolation.</p>
<p>The first person works at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, 
officials said, but they are not aware of any possible exposure to 
patients.</p>
<p>The state health department is notifying people who, like the first patient, attended an invitation-only event on February 28.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin: 1</h3>
<p>Wisconsin reported its only case of the coronavirus in early 
February. The patient was an adult with a history of travel to Beijing, 
the Wisconsin Department of Health Services <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/020520.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener">said.</a></p>
<p>That person was isolated and doing well and the risk to the public was low, the department said.</p>
<p>That individual has recovered and is out of isolation, CNN affiliate <a href="https://cbs58.com/news/first-wisconsin-patient-with-coronavirus-has-recovered-2-new-cases-pending" rel="noreferrer noopener">WDJT</a> reported.</p>

 ORLEANS - Temperatures over 100 degrees can make it difficult to 
breathe under normal conditions. With a mask, it could be even worse. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Wearing
 a mask in public places in Louisiana is now a law if you're eight years
 old or older. However, with much of the state experiencing excessive 
heat warnings along with more heat advisories this week, St. Tammany 
Coroner Charles Preston says, there may be exceptions to wearing a mask.
