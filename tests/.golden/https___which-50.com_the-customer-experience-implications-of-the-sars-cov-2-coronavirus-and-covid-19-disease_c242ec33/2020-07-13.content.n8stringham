<article class="rm-manual"> <span><span>Augie Ray</span></span> <span>2020-02-25</span></article><p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease are increasingly making headlines. As you are no doubt aware, the number of known and <a href="https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported cases will surpass 80,000 today, and more than 2,600 have been killed by the disease</a>.
 While the first priority is health and safety, CX leaders must give 
consideration to how this growing epidemic (soon, likely, to be <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/pandemic-coronavirus-outbreak-economic-impact/">labeled a pandemic</a>) will impact customers.</p>
<p>Customer Experience (CX) is about knowing and responding to customer 
expectations and needs to improve customer satisfaction, loyalty, and 
advocacy. In typical times, it can difficult to understand what drives 
satisfaction and dissatisfaction and encourages loyalty and disloyalty. 
But in those rare moments in time when unexpected, profound, and 
significant changes are thrust upon the world (so-called “<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.investopedia.com_terms_b_blackswan.asp&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=qRq7a-87GiVVW7v8KD1gdQ&amp;r=aKKMgtkZesroQ2p1HELVZw01VrJ9l1lqGo0PzXUfh7M&amp;m=pZ_Q3KMiN3vRR-CeTEdqlfKWt-enqHH3w1oQZU4qKN4&amp;s=j5pIrKEMOwQhl9tO6EicaY_Y5OsaOVQvYHo8BycT51U&amp;e=" rel="noopener noreferrer">black swan events”</a>), your customer’s needs and expectations can evolve in rapid and surprising ways.</p>
<p>At this point, depending on your brand’s category, you might think that your primary issues are oriented to your <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/coronavirus-how-to-secure-your-supply-chain/" rel="noopener noreferrer">supply chain</a>
 and not to changes in customer preferences, attitudes, or behaviours. 
It’s sensible to plan ahead for interruptions to your production and 
operations, but customer-centric organisations will also prepare for how
 their customers’ questions and needs will change rapidly in the coming 
months.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it might be argued that all brands are on equal 
footing, so the impact of your words and actions will have little 
influence on your brand’s satisfaction, loyalty, and advocacy relative 
to its competition. After all, today’s epidemic was unforeseen just two 
months ago, and with the news changing daily, your brand, just like all 
brands and people, is caught in a maelstrom of rapidly evolving 
knowledge and recommendations.</p>
<p>That’s true, but with each passing week, brands will be made unequal 
based on their preparedness, communications, priorities, and actions. 
This event, just like any that alters consumer expectations, activities,
 and motivations, will impact the customer perception of different 
brands in different ways. Keep in mind our opportunity to excel (or 
fail) for customers is greatest in instances when emotion and needs are 
running high versus in regular periods when everything is going as 
expected.</p>
<p>Today’s global health emergency may be without precedent for 
generations, but that doesn’t mean our brands cannot find ways to 
prepare for different customer scenarios and maintain a customer-centric
 approach in the face of the unexpected. Traditional crisis response 
along with CX best practices provide some guidance you can use and 
consider:</p>
<p>First, consider likely and possible changes to customer needs and 
journeys: Generally, customer personas, needs, and journeys shift 
relatively slowly over time, but the coming months won’t be business as 
usual. Customer awareness, concern, and reaction to the virus will bring
 rapid shifts to expectations and needs, and growing government 
restrictions will impact customer actions.</p>
<p>CX leaders can direct and participate in efforts to build customer 
scenarios based on the research and data they already possess about 
customer perceptions and priorities. One way to do so is to work with 
cross-functional teams to envision how the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 
and COVID-19 will impact customer journeys. Start with reality–how are 
my customers affected today in their locations, and what do we know 
about interruptions to our firm’s supply chains? But don’t stop with 
only what is already known. In times of rapid change, consider scenarios
 for how your different customer segments and personas are likely to be 
affected by the epidemic.</p>
<p>Identify potential changes in customers’ journeys and the touchpoints
 that may be most important to customers in these unusual times, and 
prepare for likely shifts away from existing journeys and touchpoints. 
Evaluating your customer data and forecasting shifts in future wants and
 needs is a customer-centric way to prepare your brand to better serve 
your customers as your less-prepared competitors scramble to react.</p>
<p>Be proactive now with information for customers: If you wait for 
customers and employees to grow concerned and start demanding 
information from your brand, you’ll already be too late. If you have not
 yet, start working on a proactive and reactive communication plan.</p>
<p>Don’t just consider what your brand will want to communicate. 
Consider questions customers will have and ask of your employees, and 
evaluate if your brand has an opportunity or obligation to provide 
information. It might not seem, for example, that a retailer needs to 
address how customers can keep themselves safe in a pandemic, but 
conveying what your brand is doing to ensure a safe shopping experience 
in physical locations can earn trust (and business). Informational needs
 for customers may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I keep myself and my family safe while using your product or service?</li>
<li>Should I alter any behaviours, actions, or buying decisions to minimise my risk?</li>
<li>How do I know your products safe?</li>
<li>How will the interruptions caused by the virus impact your delivery and support?</li>
<li>Does your brand recommend I do something today to prepare for the future?</li>
</ul>
<p>How your brand responds to questions like this will vary wildly based
 on your category. A travel company will have a very different answer 
than one that produces cosmetics, for example. Consider both the 
proactive and reactive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proactive: Understand customers’ informational needs and provide 
that content proactively via websites, social media, and apps. This will
 help you to meet and exceed customer expectations, demonstrate your 
care, minimise contact volume, and avoid business disruptions.</li>
<li>Reactive: Arm your contact center, social media, sales, and PR teams
 with the info they’ll need to demonstrate your brand’s concern for the 
health and welfare of its customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, consider how your customers’ changing needs and perceptions 
may impact your other marketing and communications plans. Consider your 
upcoming campaigns in terms of messaging and timing. Do you want to 
invest in a substantial new campaign with a comedic tone as your 
audience is concerned about growing COVID-19 mortality or launch ads 
showing people partying together as restrictions on mass gatherings are 
being implemented?</p>
<p>Listen to your customers: CX and customer insight leaders are in a 
better position than others in the organization to understand how 
customer needs and expectations are swiftly changing. Start shifting 
your customer listening strategy immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Voice of the Customer platforms to monitor for mentions of the virus and disease in your survey responses.</li>
<li>Tune your social listening platforms to recognise broad trends among
 your customers and specific inquiries directed to your brand’s Twitter 
and other social media accounts.</li>
<li>Work with your customer care team to capture and report changes in 
customer queries and call volume related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attitudes and perceptions will change very rapidly, so it will be 
essential to establish real-time monitoring and reporting. Many people 
who were not taking the virus seriously a week ago are doing so today, 
and those who aren’t concerned today may be so within weeks. Simply put,
 month-old data on customer attitudes and perceptions of the virus may 
as well be decade-old data, so stay abreast of changes that may occur 
day-to-day in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Be prepared to act: Scenario planning, providing relevant info, and 
listening to customer sentiment are a good start, but as the virus 
grows, your customers’ needs will be less informational and more 
behavioural:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will your brand deal with cancelations and returns at scale? 
Will you alter policies to support customers in this unique time?</li>
<li>Does your brand depend on real-world delivery of products and 
services, and how will you serve customers if those are curtailed? Will 
you need to implement testing or furnish masks to customers? How will 
you deal with customers who exhibit symptoms? Must your employees in 
every location understand and interact with local health officials?</li>
<li>How might you support people who are quarantined, either voluntarily
 and under government restrictions? Can you shift to digital delivery or
 at-home deliveries to serve customers? Can your brand offer solutions 
to keep people healthy, fed, safe, and entertained if they’re 
quarantined at home for extended periods?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to questions such as these are not easy since they 
involve issues of product, logistics, inventory, supply chain, and 
operations. Don’t be fooled into thinking these questions are only 
pertinent for brands in the most immediately affected categories, like 
health products and travel. These questions can and will impact your 
customers and your brands in the coming months.</p>
<p>Plan for rapid shifts in corporate priorities and budgets: CX 
leaders, as with all business leaders, must plan for interruptions to 
their existing portfolio of projects. Organisational priorities will 
shift, and efforts once thought important or urgent may quickly seem 
less vital as new customer needs quickly emerge or business operations 
are interrupted. The opposite may also happen–individual projects may 
need to be accelerated to establish urgent customer capabilities. For 
example, a CX effort to train employees on empathy cues may be put on 
hold as call volumes rise and employee attendance falls; conversely, a 
program to improve online self-service capabilities may be escalated to 
better support urgent customer needs.</p>
<p>Resources will shift as companies change their focus from solving 
broken touchpoints to addressing distinct and urgent customer needs and 
flexing to address severe operational, manufacturing, or logistics 
issues. Under normal conditions, CX leaders need to fight to secure and 
keep resources, but in the coming months, their ability to use customer 
insight to inform urgent decisions and support shifts in priorities will
 be more important than maintaining a steady course.</p>
<p>Your organisation is already, undoubtedly, discussing the potential 
or actual implications to the business of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, but 
are you also being customer-centric and evaluating how your customers’ 
needs and expectations will evolve? Don’t just focus on the impact on 
your business; consider the virus’s implications to your customers’ 
health, lives, preferences, and behaviours. Keep your brand 
customer-focused, and you will be better prepared to know how customer 
needs and expectations are changing, to rapidly adapt to those changes, 
and to improve customer relationships, trust, and loyalty throughout the
 epidemic period and beyond.</p>
