<p class="rm-manual">The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new 
coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for 
some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, 
it can cause more severe illness or death.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">TOP OF THE HOUR:</p>
<p class="rm-manual">— China pushes back against “Wuhan virus” label.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">— Health minister in Romania resigns.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">— France evacuates coronavirus patients on medicalized train.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">___</p>
<p>BEIJING — China is strongly pushing back on U.S. Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo’s insistence on referring to the deadly novel coronavirus 
that has sparked a global pandemic as the “Wuhan virus” after the city 
in China where it was first detected.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Thursday that it was an 
effort to “stigmatize China and discredit China’s efforts in an attempt 
to divert attention and shift responsibilities.”</p>
<p>“He has a very sinister motive,” Geng told reporters at a daily briefing.</p>
<p>Geng also defended China’s efforts at tackling the virus and denied 
it was seeking to place responsibility for the outbreak elsewhere. China
 has been accused of trying to squelch information about the outbreak 
during its early stages, and some of its diplomats have openly suggested
 that the virus may have been brought to China from the United States.</p>
<p>Pompeo’s call for the virus to be identified by name as the “Wuhan 
virus” at a virtual meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of 7 
leading industrialized countries resulted in their opting against 
releasing a group statement.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization and others have cautioned against 
giving the virus a geographic name because of its global nature, and 
even President Donald Trump has steered away from those terms as critics
 have said they foster discriminatory sentiments and behavior against 
Asians and Asian Americans.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>BUCHAREST, Romania — Romania’s prime minister has announced the 
resignation of the health minister, whose announcement that everyone in 
the capital city of Bucharest would be tested for the coronavirus had 
been strongly criticized.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ludovic Orban said Thursday in a statement that while 
he regretted Victor Costache’s departure, “on the other hand, I 
understand it and I thank him.”</p>
<p>Orban said the government’s priority was to acquire protective equipment for hospitals to protect medical staff.</p>
<p>Romania has registered 906 coronavirus cases, with 17 deaths.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>PARIS — France has begun evacuating its citizens infected with the 
coronavirus from the Alsace epicenter onboard a special medicalized 
high-speed train.</p>
<p>France’s health minister said that the TGV train-cum-hospital is a “first in Europe.”</p>
<p>Around 20 patients are being evacuated from Strasbourg to hospitals 
in the Pays-de-la-Loire and other regions Thursday morning, thanks to 
the medical locomotive.</p>
<p>It consists of five cars, each one kitted out with medical material 
and attended by an anesthesiologist-resuscitator, an intern, a nurse 
anesthetist and three nurses.</p>
<p>The train has been employed to relieve the French region worst hit by
 the coronavirus that has already claimed over 1,300 lives in France — 
almost half of whom have died in the Grand Est region’s hospitals.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>MOSCOW — Russia’s Defense Ministry promised to build 16 medical 
centers for treating infectious diseases by mid-May amid the growing 
coronavirus outbreak in the country. The centers will be spread across a
 range of Russian regions, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said at a 
government meeting Thursday.</p>
<p>“We need to ensure the fastest construction of these centers in order
 for our military medicine to be ready to deal with the (coronavirus) 
infection,” Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said.</p>
<p>Russia has ramped up measures to prevent the new virus from spreading
 further as its caseload grew at an increasing pace. Earlier on 
Thursday, the government announced halting all international flights 
except for those bringing Russian nationals home from abroad. On 
Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin declared next week a holiday, during
 which only essential businesses – such as grocery shops, pharmacies and
 banks – will operate.</p>
<p>Russian authorities reported 840 cases of the new coronavirus on Thursday, with 182 new cases registered since the day before.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey’s trade minister says the country is 
restricting the export of respirator-related medical equipment in order 
to meet domestic needs.</p>
<p>Ruhsar Pekcan said on Twitter Thursday that the export of equipment 
including ventilators, intubation devices and intensive care monitors 
would be subject to government authorization.</p>
<p>The measure aims to ensure that a “disruption to the health services 
does not occur and the existing capacity is used effectively,” the 
minister said.</p>
<p>Turkey has reported 59 COVID-19 deaths and at least 2,433 infections.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>MOSCOW — Moscow officials on Thursday ordered to close restaurants, 
cafes, bars, shopping malls and some parks in the city for nine days 
starting from Saturday.</p>
<p>The move, aimed at keeping people at home amid the coronavirus 
outbreak, comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared 
next week a holiday, during which only essential businesses — such as 
pharmacies, grocery stores and banks — will continue to operate.</p>
<p>The number of coronavirus cases in Russia has been growing rapidly 
this week. Russian authorities reported 840 cases of the new coronavirus
 on Thursday, with 182 new cases registered since the day before.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin told Putin that the 
situation is “serious.” Russia’s comparatively low caseload could 
reflect insufficient screening rather than the actual scale of the 
epidemic, he said, and urged Putin to ramp up testing all across the 
country.</p>

<p>STOCKHOLM — Sweden saw a surge in the number of deaths that could 
change the Scandinavian’s rather lax approach keeping primary and 
elementary schools, restaurants and bars open and even encouraging 
people to go out and enjoy the spring sun.</p>
<p>Health officials have within the past 24 hours seen an increase of 18
 deaths since Wednesday, bringing the total to 62 deaths in the country 
of 10 million that has had 2,510 people tested positive of which 176 are
 in intensive care.</p>
<p>The head of Stockholm’s health service Bjorn Eriksson said “the storm
 is over us,” hours after Anders Tegnell of the Public Health Agency of 
Sweden told a news conference that the situation was “stable.”</p>
<p>In neighboring Denmark, the government allegedly was planning to 
further tighten the law so that smaller groups — less than 10 — can be 
banned.</p>
<p>And in Finland, the government says it will in an exceptional move 
block the movement of citizens into and out of a key southern region 
that includes the Nordic nation’s capital, Helsinki, to prevent the 
spreading of coronavirus to other areas. The Uusimaa region includes 
Helsinki and affects the daily lives of some 1.7 million people, nearly a
 third of Finland’s population.</p>

<p>LONDON — Britain’s government has ordered 10,000 ventilators to grapple with the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Billionaire inventor James Dyson told his staff in an email that a 
team of engineers had been working on a design for the last 10 days 
since receiving a request for help from Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>Dyson says the device draws on technology used in the company’s air purifier ranges and is powered by a digital motor.</p>
<p>The device was created in partnership with Cambridge-based science engineering firm TTP and still must face regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Britain wants to increase the availability of ventilators from 8,000 to 30,000.</p>

<p>TOKYO — Tokyo Olympic organizers announced Thursday that they are 
canceling a cultural event featuring collaborative performances of 
kabuki and opera next month due to the spreading of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The event already had a setback last year after world-famous tenor 
Placido Domingo withdrew following his sexual harassment allegations.</p>
<p>The cancellation follows Tuesday’s agreement between Tokyo’s 
Organizing Committee and the International Olympic Committee to postpone
 the Tokyo Games until the summer of 2021 due to the ongoing global 
pandemic.</p>
<p>The revised “Tokyo 2020 Nippon Festival” scheduled for April 18, was 
to feature Japanese kabuki actor Ebizo Ichikawa and opera singers — 
Italian soprano Anna Pirozi and Uruguayan bass-baritone Erwin Schrott — 
in a performance aimed at bringing together the east and the west and 
contrasting the traditional and the modern.</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia’s king and queen are under 
quarantine after seven palace staff members tested positive for 
COVID-19.</p>
<p>The palace said Thursday that seven staff were hospitalized Tuesday 
and health authorities were trying to identify the source of the 
transmission. It said King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah and his 
wife Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah were tested for the virus,
 but both were negative. It said the royal couple decided to observe a 
14-day self-quarantine from Wednesday, with deep cleansing to be carried
 out in the palace.</p>
<p>Malaysia, which has 21 deaths and the highest total of cases in 
Southeast Asia at 1,796, has extended its lockdown by another two weeks 
to April 14.</p>

<p>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka: — Sri Lanka’s president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has 
requested international donor agencies to provide a debt moratorium or 
debt deferment facility to all developing nations facing the risk of 
being severely affected by coronavirus.</p>
<p>Rajapaksa had urged Director General of the World Health Organization
 to forward this request to multi-lateral and bilateral lending 
agencies.</p>
<p>He has pointed out that such “a relief would be helpful to manage 
COVID-19 Social Distancing, Public Health and Social Security Systems in
 those countries.”</p>
<p>His statement comes as Sri Lanka will have to repay a US $4.8 billion
 external debt this year amid an economy that performed poorly last 
year. The island nation’s economy suffered a severe blow last year due 
to the Easter Sunday bomb attacks by Islamic militants.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka’s economic growth is estimated to hit an 18-year low of 2.7 to 2.8% in 2019.</p>
<p>However, the International Monetary Fund said in February that Sri 
Lanka’s economy is gradually recovering from the terrorist attacks last 
April. The IMF said the real GDP growth is estimated at 2.6% in 2019 and
 that the GDP growth in 2020 is projected at 3.7%.</p>

<p>MOSCOW — Russian government officials announced the halting of all 
international flights starting from Friday amid the coronavirus 
pandemic.</p>
<p>An exception will be made for flights bringing Russians home from 
abroad, according to a statement published Thursday on the cabinet’s 
website.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Russian authorities limited its air traffic to regular flights to world capitals and charter flights.</p>
<p>The new measure comes as the number of coronavirus cases in Russia 
rapidly grows. On Wednesday, the government reported a total of 658 
cases, with 163 new cases registered since the previous day. That is a 
significantly bigger daily increase than in previous weeks, when the 
number of cases was growing by several dozens a day.</p>

<p>SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s central bank says it will 
temporarily provide an “unlimited” amount of money to eligible banks and
 other financial institutions for three months through repurchase 
agreements as it tries to calm financial markets rattled by the global 
coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea on Thursday said the measure was unprecedented but 
didn’t provide an estimate on how much money would be supplied to 
financial markets through the short-term borrowings.</p>
<p>The bank last week executed an emergency rate cut of 0.5 percentage 
points to help ease the economic fallout from the coronavirus, which 
brought its policy rate to an all-time low of 0.75%.</p>
<p>Some experts say it’s unclear whether traditional financial tools to 
boost money supplies would be effective now when the global pandemic has
 damaged both supply and demand, decimating industrial hubs in China and
 Italy and forcing millions to stay at home under tightened quarantines.</p>
