<p>RICHMOND, Va. — The leader of the Catholic Diocese of Richmond said 
Monday that he was suspending all public Masses because of concern about
 COVID-19 which, as of Monday, had killed two people in Hampton Roads.</p>
<p>Bishop Barry C. Knestout said the directive was effective immediately and included Sunday Masses, holy days, and weekday Masses.</p>
<p>Knestout made the decision in support of the guidance from federal 
and state public health officials. It was an effort to ensure public 
safety of Catholics as well as other people.</p>
<p>Governor Ralph Northam had issued a ban on gatherings of more than 
100 people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also made a 
recommendation that people nationwide cancel events that would draw more
 than 50 people to them.</p>

<p>The bishop also issued these directives:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Confirmation liturgies are suspended until further notice.</li>
<li>All weddings and funerals should continue with the attendance 
limited to immediate family members. The numbers should not exceed 50 
people.</li>
<li>Pastoral care by priests for the sick remains of the utmost importance during this time and will continue.</li>
<li>Churches should remain open for individual private prayer, but gatherings of multiple individuals for prayer are discouraged.</li>
<li>Non-essential meetings are cancelled. If an essential meeting is needed, it should not exceed 50 people.</li>
<li>Priests will continue to celebrate their own private Masses daily to pray for their parishioners and the diocese.</li>
<li>Bishop Knestout will livestream private celebration of Sunday Masses for the foreseeable future.</li>
<li>Parishes with similar livestream capabilities are encouraged to do the same for their parishioners.</li>

<p>Here is the <a href="https://richmonddiocese.org/bishop-knestout-writes-letter-to-the-faithful-in-regard-to-covid-19/">full letter</a> that Knestout sent to members of the diocese:</p>
<p>Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,</p>
<p>As anxiety and concerns about the possible spread of COVID-19 takes 
root throughout this land and so much of the world, the Lord is speaking
 to us, calling us to a deeper relationship with him. This age may seem 
to be a time of fear and isolation, but we have an opportunity to see it
 in a new light, as a retreat into the desert with Our Lord and to 
encounter God in solitude and prayer. As Psalm 91 says:</p>
<p>“You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies 
by day, nor the plague that prowls in the darkness, nor the scourge that
 lays waste at noon. A thousand may fall at our side, ten thousand fall 
at your right, you it will never approach; his faithfulness is buckler 
and shield.”</p>
<p>Given the necessary restrictions to public gatherings in the 
Commonwealth of Virginia, to ensure the common good, to provide for 
public health and safety, and yet to maintain the mission of the Church 
allowing access to the sacraments, to Church teaching and to works of 
charity in a way appropriate to the circumstances of our age, as well as
 to renew our spiritual vitality as a diocese during a time of Jubilee, I
 am instructing the following to take place within our diocese.</p>
<p>As a suspension of all public celebrations of Mass, on Sundays, holy 
days and weekdays in the Diocese of Richmond takes place, and as the 
days grow longer and the light of spring begins to shine, opening our 
eyes to the goodness of God, I invite all the faithful in their homes 
and in the solitude of their hearts to draw close to Christ our light in
 prayer and interior desire for the Lord who dwells within our hearts – 
asking for the grace of forgiveness, recovery of our spiritual sight and
 of an awakening of desire for God to be strengthened within us.</p>
<p>This weekend, during a private celebration of Mass at the Cathedral 
of the Sacred Heart and in the midst of our Jubilee year, I will 
celebrate Mass without a congregation, asking God’s grace and 
forgiveness, consecrating our diocese to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and 
the Immaculate Heart of Mary. So that you may join me in this moment, it
 will be streamed live for the faithful.</p>
<p>Each priest is to celebrate his daily Mass in private in the church 
or a chapel on behalf of the intentions of his parish and for the 
universal Church to assist all those affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>For the time being, I am instructing that during the daylight hours 
all of our parish churches are to keep their doors open for the 
possibility of private prayer or devotion. As the People of God of 
necessity go to the grocery store for food, they can also drop by their 
parish church to sustain their spiritual lives.</p>
<p>If quarantines or greater public restrictions are put in place 
limiting to a greater degree public movement and gatherings, or if more 
than 50 people recommended by the CDC gather in the church building, it 
will be closed to further access from outside.</p>
<p>While open, a porter, assigned by the pastor, is to be stationed 
during the daylight hours at the one unlocked door of the church so that
 no more than 50 people at any one time may be in the Church.</p>
<p>Individually, and always keeping an appropriate social distance from 
one another, parishioners are free, during a time of fear and 
uncertainty, to come at their discretion during the day for personal 
devotion, communion by desire, to pray the rosary or the Stations of the
 Cross.</p>
<p>I am also asking at this time that the Blessed Sacrament be move to 
the center of the large or main body of the church. Our Lord is to be 
reserved and secured in the tabernacle, clearly visible in the larger 
main body of the church throughout daylight hours especially Saturday 
and Sunday – so that during private devotion and prayer, appropriate 
social distancing can be maintained, which is impossible in the smaller 
adoration chapels.</p>
<p>Priests are to be available for personal confessions at specific 
times of the day in a large adjacent room that would allow security, 
limited access and provide at least six feet of space between them and 
any penitent.</p>
<p>Pastoral care by the priest to the sick is of utmost importance 
during this time. If a priest is unable to visit the sick for whatever 
reason or concerned with visiting sick because he fits one of the 
vulnerable categories, he will contact his dean.</p>
<p>Communion will not normally be brought to any other parishioner who 
is homebound or who cannot attend Mass. Prayers for communion by desire 
will be widely available in the church and the parish website. 
Communion, if requested, will be brought to those who are near death 
when administering Viaticum.</p>
<p>Lay volunteers will not be visiting the sick in any official 
capacity. Deacons may visit the sick using their discretion, taking into
 consideration their age or immunocompromised status.</p>
<p>Essential charitable efforts to the poor and vulnerable will continue
 with some adaptations. Restrictions will be in place for no more than 
25 people in a building at a time. It will be recommended that only 
individuals who are not within vulnerable groups or immunocompromised be
 the ones to assist the poor. Hot food service or seated food service in
 soup kitchens will be discontinued and replaced by grab-and-go options.
 All surfaces, including restrooms, must be sanitized frequently. 
Drop-off locations for donations should be outside the main facility 
thus limiting those who may be exposed to larger groups.</p>
<p>With these provisions in place, we will continue with the Church’s 
mission: teaching the faith, celebrating the sacraments as needed in 
this age, and care for the poor, even as we support the common good and 
assure the health and well-being of our neighbor.</p>
<p>As the world responds to this emergency, we turn our attention to the
 Holy Spirit to give us strength and courage in times of trial and 
suffering. We offer our prayers to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and ask the
 intercession of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. May we know the depths of
 the Lord’s merciful love and may Our Lady keep us in the mantle of her 
protection to intercede for us in our time of need.</p>
<p>With the assurance of prayers for you and all affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am,</p>
<p>Sincerely in Christ,</p>
<p>Most Reverend Barry C. Knestout Bishop of Richmond</p></article>
