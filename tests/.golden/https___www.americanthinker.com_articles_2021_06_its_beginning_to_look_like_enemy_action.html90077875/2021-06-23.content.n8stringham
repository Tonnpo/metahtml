<h1 class="rm-manual">Itâ€™s Beginning to Look Like Enemy Action</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">By <a href="file:///author/johngreen/">John Green</a> </p>
<p>Dong Jingwei is a Chinese defector working with the Defense 
Intelligence Agency (DIA). He served as Vice Minister of State Security 
in the Chinese Ministry of Defense. Before defecting, he was responsible
 for the counterintelligence efforts in China. He was in a position to 
know about all things “espionage” in China and is perhaps the 
highest-level Chinese defector the U.S. has ever had. Even though the 
legacy media is playing it down, this is a big deal.</p>
<p>It speaks volumes that the man who knows the identity of all the 
Chinese spies in our country chose to defect to the DIA and only the 
DIA. Further, it’s reported that the DIA is not sharing the information 
it’s receiving with the FBI or CIA. Now, why would that be?</p>
<p>Dong provided details of meetings between U.S. officials, Chinese 
spies, and Russian SVR agents. He also provided details about how the 
Chinese government gained access to CIA communications, which resulted 
in the deaths of dozens of CIA assets. Anonymous sources are also 
reporting that members of the federal law enforcement community (i.e. 
FBI) are “scared s**tless” about Dong’s information. </p>
<p>Is it possible that the FBI and CIA are hopelessly compromised? As we’d say in Minnesota -- you betcha!</p>
<p>Dong has allegedly provided the names of Chinese spies working or 
attending universities in the U.S. He claims that a third of Chinese 
students in this country are actually PLA assets. To validate his 
claims, Dong has provided financial records showing which businessmen 
and public officials have received money from the Chinese Government. 
Private persons receiving money may or may not be illegal depending on 
what they’re doing for it. If they’re selling protected technology, it’s
 illegal. If they’re influencing public opinion, it may not be illegal, 
but is still problematic. However, public officials receiving money is a
 huge deal -- it’s either bribery or espionage.</p>
<p>How much are businesses, educators, public officials, and opinion 
influencers beholden to China? It appears to be a disturbing number.</p>
<p>Dong provided copies of Hunter Biden’s laptop hard drives to the DIA.
 Granted, there’s not much that’s secret about that laptop anymore. But 
isn’t China verifying their possession of those drives kind of like a 
blackmailer showing his victim pictures of himself in bed with an 
underage girl? How incriminating is that picture when information from 
Hunter’s laptop is combined with financial records which the Chinese 
surely have? Maybe there’s more than one underage girl in that photo.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC) <a href="https://redstate.com/jenvanlaar/2020/10/24/hunter-biden-chinese-military-stealth-joe-john-kerry268540-n268540">acquired Henniges Automotive</a>.
 This acquisition is significant because Henniges Automotive provides 
stealth technology for the F-35 program. AVIC’s U.S. partners in this 
acquisition were none other than Hunter Biden and Chris Heinz. The 
acquisition was approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the 
United States (CFIUS). Secretary of State John Kerry was a member of the
 CFIUS during this decision. He is also the stepfather of -- surprise, 
surprise -- Chris Heinz! Dong provided details of how China was able to 
acquire stealth technology after the U.S. approved its purchase of 
Henniges Automotive.</p>
<p>Anyone who doesn’t see that the Biden family's financial ties to 
China leave President Asterisk vulnerable to blackmail is hopelessly 
naïve.</p>
<p>Dong provided copies of pathogenic studies to the DIA which show that
 the Chinese military was involved in the development of the COVID-19 
virus. He also provided copies of Chinese models which predicted the 
spread and damage that the pandemic would do to the U.S. and the rest of
 the world. Given what we’re learning about Dr. Fauci and his “gain of 
function” research, we may have paid China to develop a weapon that was 
used against us.</p>
<p>Further, the Chinese government changed the travel plans of Chinese 
students returning to the U.S. after the Christmas break. Their travel 
plans were advanced so that they returned much earlier than originally 
planned -- prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. Dong reportedly 
claimed that they were tasked to gather information about the U.S. 
response to the pandemic. They were to gather information on:</p>
<ul> <li>Policy changes</li> <li>Economic response and damage</li> <li>Impacts on the healthcare system</li> <li>Impacts on the supply chain</li> <li>Civil unrest</li> </ul>
<p>The implication is that even if the Chinese government did not 
intentionally release the virus, they intentionally let it spread and 
used it as an espionage bonanza. As a side benefit to the Chinese, 
COVID-19 provided the excuse for massive election changes, which 
facilitated the removal of President Donald Trump -- China’s greatest 
threat. They learned from the Democrats not to let a good crisis go to 
waste. </p>
<p>As far as we know, Dong has not provided any direct information about
 BLM or Antifa. However, the fact that returning Chinese students were 
tasked to monitor civil unrest is quite curious. If our FBI and CIA 
weren’t hopelessly compromised, they might consider following the money.
 But we already know that won’t be happening.</p>
<p>This all brings me to the most important point -- have we been under 
attack from China and didn’t know it? A colleague recently reminded me 
of the Goldfinger dictum: “Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. 
Three times, now that is enemy action.”</p>
