<p>Our smartphones are an increasingly essential part of our day-to-day.
 These devices fit in our pockets but have taken the place of so many 
other gadgets and products. From calculators to cameras and everything 
in between, we can almost do it all on our phones. Nothing’s perfect 
though, but luckily, the ever-growing phone accessories industry makes 
up for any shortcomings.</p>
<p>Your new phone doesn’t have a headphone jack? There are a lot of 
excellent wireless options to choose from. Want to make sure that the 
beautifully designed device doesn’t get damaged? A case or screen 
protector is useful. Worried about the phone battery dying in the middle
 of your day? A power bank is a must-have. In this buyer’s guide, we 
take a look at the best phone accessories, from the necessary to the 
niche, that you can get!</p>
<h2>The essential accessories Android Authority recommends</h2>
<p>As you go further down this page, you’ll see that there are many 
types of phone accessories available. While all of them help enhance 
your smartphone experience, not every add-on is necessary. There are a 
few accessories that we think are essential though.</p>
<p>One accessory that is a must-have for most users is a <a href="#cases">protective case or cover</a>.
 Phones nowadays come with beautiful designs, glass builds, and large 
displays, and it sucks to have to cover it up. But the only way to make 
sure that the device stays in good condition is with a case. Unfortunate
 accidents can happen even if you are careful, and a shattered screen or
 glass back can be expensive to repair.</p>
<p>Next on the list is a <a href="#powerbanks">power bank</a>. Most 
phones give you at least a day of battery life with average use, but 
“average” is the keyword there. Your phone battery will drain really 
quickly if you use the camera a lot, play a lot of games, use the phone 
for GPS navigation all day, or any other battery-intensive activities. A
 good portable power bank will ensure that you never have to worry about
 a dying phone battery ever again.</p>
<p>Another accessory that will be essential for many people is a pair of <a href="#bluetoothheadphones">Bluetooth headphones</a>.
 Only a handful of phones come with good built-in speakers, and the 
future of the headphone jack is still in limbo. Luckily, Bluetooth 
headphones and earphones are getting better and better with every 
generation, and there are plenty of fantastic options to choose from 
now.</p>
<p>Just looking for a quick recommendation? Here’s what we suggest:</p>

<h2>First-party vs third-party accessories</h2>
<p>Before diving into the many accessories you can get for your phone, 
let’s first talk about who makes them. Some OEMs make their own 
accessories to support a particular smartphone or a range of devices. A 
lot of OEMs release cases for their phones, but some, like Samsung, have
 a much wider range of accessories on offer.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the OEM behind your phone does not make 
third-party accessories. These products are intended to either plug some
 holes in the accessories market or offer an alternative to first-party 
options that are often significantly cheaper. Both varieties of 
accessories have their fair share of pros and cons though.</p>
<h3>Pros and cons of first-party phone accessories</h3>
<p>The biggest advantage with a first-party accessory is the fact that 
these are made with a particular phone or range of phones in mind. So, 
while the Google wireless charger works with other devices, it is the 
only option if you want to enjoy fast charging speeds with the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-4-xl-990519/">Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL</a> or the <a href="file:///google-pixel-5-1123659/">Pixel 5</a>. </p>
<p>On the other hand, a distinct lack of variety is the major issue with
 first-party accessories. Only a handful of OEMs release accessories, 
and it’s mostly cases and covers. Samsung is one of the few companies 
that has a decent portfolio of accessories on offer. OEM accessories are
 also notoriously expensive, and you’ll often find as good, or even 
better, alternatives from third-party companies.</p>
<p>The good news is that things are slowly changing. More and more 
companies are releasing accessories like wireless chargers, Bluetooth 
earphones, and more. Granted, the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/smartphone-limit-headset-updates-1140558/">inevitable locking up of available functionality</a> based on what phone you’re using is an unfortunate consequence.</p>
<h3>Pros and cons of third-party accessories</h3>
<p>Third-party accessories have the leg up in a lot of aspects since 
they often fill existing gaps in the accessories market. Third-party 
companies dominate categories like phone holders, screen protectors, 
microSD cards, and a slew of Bluetooth accessories. Even in areas where 
OEMs attempt to compete, like cases, third-party case makers boast a 
much larger range of options. These options are generally more 
affordable as well.</p>
<p>The cons with these accessories are two-fold. The generic nature of 
these products may not always provide the best results. Standard 
wireless chargers work well enough, but with some devices, you’ll see 
slower charging times than you’d receive with a first-party charger.</p>
<p>The much bigger issue though is sorting through the hundreds of 
options available, with many coming from companies that aren’t well 
known, or even unheard of. Buying a bad charger, cable, or power bank 
could have severe consequences including potentially damaging your 
device. Device compatibility is an overlooked issue. Some accessories 
may not work with your phone at all, so it’s definitely important to do 
your research first.</p>
<h3>Things to look for when buying third-party accessories</h3>
<p>Before you buy an accessory from a brand you’re not familiar with, just be sure to check for the following:</p>
<ul> <li>Look through owner-submitted reviews on sites like Amazon. What
 are people saying? Do these short reviews look legit? For example, it’s
 possible they are paid or sponsored submissions if they are super vague
 and poorly written.</li> <li>Look for oddities like if the product 
reviews aren’t actually for the product! This surprisingly happens a lot
 with 3rd party accessories from obscure brands. An excellent review of a
 rice cooker is not what I want to see when trying to buy a case.</li> <li>Familiarize
 yourself with the return policy of the product. While a lot of products
 have return periods, some might only have a replacement window, in 
which case a refund won’t be possible.</li> <li>We’re here to help! 
Android Authority has literally hundreds of guides to help you navigate 
through the convoluted world of phone and other device accessories. From

<h2>The best cases</h2>
<p>Ryan-Thomas Shaw / Android Authority</p>
<p>Most smartphones nowadays feature metal or glass builds, and so, 
keeping them safe and free from damage can be quite difficult. A good 
case or cover goes a long way, even if you don’t want to hide the 
phone’s beautiful design. However, some cases can add some style points 
to it as well. From the ultra-slim to the extremely rugged, there’s a 
cover for everybody.</p>
<h3>What kind of case do I need?</h3>
<p>We can broadly divide phone cases into four different categories — 
thin, hybrid, wallet, and rugged. These categories are mostly 
self-explanatory, but let’s take a quick look at what you get.</p>
<ul> <li>Thin cases: These cases are usually ultra-thin and don’t add 
any weight to the phone. The single-layer covers are made with either 
TPU or polycarbonate. These are perfect for anyone that wants as 
minimalistic a case as possible, but keep in mind that they may not 
always be the most protective.</li> <li>Hybrid cases: A lot of hybrid 
cases are thin and light, but offer a lot more protection than typical 
thin cases. These include anything that uses a combination of materials,
 like a polycarbonate back and a TPU bumper, or a relatively thin 
dual-layer case. These cases might be feather-light ultra-thin, but some
 come with the same <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/mil-std-810g-rating-1017646/">MIL-STD 810G-516.6</a> that you get with rugged cases.</li> <li>Rugged
 cases: Rugged cases are big and bulky but will ensure that your phone 
can survive almost anything. Heavy-duty cases are usually for those that
 work in harsh environments or are clumsy. These types of cases are also
 usually coupled with belt clips and holsters and make the phone secure.</li> <li>Wallet
 cases: Wallet cases let you keep cards, ID, and some cash while keeping
 your phone protected. Those with folio covers also help keep the 
display safe without a screen protector. A wallet case is great for 
anyone that wants the convenience of it. Genuine leather wallet cases 
are a touch expensive, but look fantastic as well.</li> </ul>
<h3>Our recommendation: Spigen for the win</h3>
<p>At Android Authority we highly recommend <a href="file:///spigen-cases-1175150/">Spigen cases</a>.
 Why? They are a perfect blend of affordability and reliability. There 
are rarely issues with Spigen cases with the fit and they are very good 
at protecting our phones. The brand also makes a variety of cases in 
pretty much every style and type you could dream of.</p>
<p>Of course, Spigen isn’t the only worthwhile brand out there. There 
are a lot of great options worth checking out in our roundup of the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-phone-case-brands-746904/">best phone case brands</a>.</p>

 above are some of the most popular ones. If you can’t find what you’re 
looking for, be sure to hit Google.</p>
<h2>The best screen protectors</h2>
<p>It’s all in the name of this one. A screen protector is intended to 
keep the phone’s display safe from damage. Replacing a display can be 
quite an expensive affair, so making sure it stays protected is a good 
idea.</p>
<h3>Types of screen protectors</h3>
<p>There are a few distinct types of screen protectors that offer 
varying degrees of protection. Some just help keep the screen free from 
scratches and other blemishes, while others will keep the display safe 
even if the phone falls on its face.</p>
<ul> <li>TPU: TPU screen protectors have been around forever and used to
 be the most popular option a while ago. These are flexible and work 
well with curved display edges and some options even come with 
“self-healing” capabilities to fix very minor blemishes. They don’t 
affect the viewing experience or touch response much but do nothing more
 than keeping the screen scratch-free. These also rely on a wet 
installation process that is sometimes difficult.</li> <li>PET: PET is 
an even thinner and more minimalistic plastic film. It’ll help keep the 
display free from scratches, but expect nothing beyond that. PET screen 
protectors are easier to install too, but you might run into issues with
 air bubbles that take a while to fix.</li> <li>Tempered glass: Tempered
 glass screen protectors are the best option if you want to make sure 
that the phone display survives a fall. You’ll also find a variety of 
features here, with options like <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/privacy-screen-protectors-explained-970541/">privacy screen guards</a>
 also available. These are thicker than the alternatives, and badly made
 options will severely affect the touch response and might even skewer 
the viewing experience.</li> </ul>
<h3>Do I need a screen protector?</h3>
<p>Screen protectors were once an essential accessory, but most current 
smartphones have a screen-protection built-in because of the materials 
used, particularly with the introduction of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-1140743/">Corning Gorilla Glass</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gorilla-glass-comparison-886866/">other options</a>. Some cases come with a raised lip around the display and other protective features to help keep the screen safe.</p>
<p>However, if you’d much rather have peace of mind, a screen protector 
is a good idea. If you’re only worried about scratches, a TPU or PET 
film option will work, but a tempered glass screen guard is much better 
for complete protection.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind though is that tempered glass screen 
protectors might not suit your phone. It’s difficult to find good 
options for phones with curved displays. The advent of under-display 
fingerprint scanners is also an issue. Many scanners don’t work at all 
with tempered glass guards. Like anything else, proper research is key 
here. Or you could always check out our recommendations!</p>

protector lists but you’ll need to hit up Google and type in your exact

<h2>The best phone holders</h2>
<p>With maps and built-in GPS navigation, your smartphone is more than 
enough to get you headed in the right direction. What isn’t a good idea 
though is to hold on to the phone while driving or riding a bike, which 
puts yourself and others at risk.</p>
<p>A phone holder does exactly what it’s supposed to do and “holds” the 
phone for you at a convenient and easy to access location, without your 
eyes having to stray too far from the road. Then you can safely navigate
 through your GPS, make emergency calls, and more by taking advantage of
 the phone’s car-friendly features like voice input.</p>
<h3>What phone holder should I get?</h3>
<p>Picking the proper car mount is the hard part. There are plenty of 
options to choose from, with many features. Most car mounts come with 
one of five points of attachment — the dashboard or windshield mount, 
the air vent, a CD player, or the auxiliary power port (cigarette 
lighter port).</p>
<p>The CD player mount is for cars that still have a CD player (and you 
no longer use it.) The same holds true for the auxiliary power port. 
This port has gone by the wayside and USB ports have replaced it in some
 cars.</p>
<p>Picking an air vent mount entirely depends on the car model. Some 
cars have curved air vents and you won’t be able to attach a car mount 
to it. Even if it fits, this will at least partially block an air vent.</p>
<p>The best option for most is a dashboard or windshield mount. You can 
place it at your convenience and compatibility issues are less of a 
concern. However, these aren’t the easiest to move around and adjust, 
and some leave a sticky residue once you remove them.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ll also have a slew of features to choose from. Some 
models are very basic, while others have special features like <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/phones-with-wireless-charging-848173/">wireless charging</a> built-in. </p>
<h3>Our recommendations</h3>
<p>iOttie One Touch 5 Car Phone Mount</p>
<p>iOttie is one of the best car phone holder makers, and the One Touch 5
 is one of the best you can get. It’s easy to see why: the design allows
 for one-handed mounting in the secure holder and a full range of 
movement. It has a sturdy suction cup that can be placed on the car’s 
inside windshield, or you can use the included sticky pad to place the 
mount on the dashboard. Other variants let you slot the phone holder 
into the car’s CD player or cup holder, or attach it to the air vent.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="http://tyvm.ly/VZkv">Check price</a></p>
<p>Belkin Universal Vent Mount</p>
<p>The Belkin Universal Mount is a simple option that attaches to your 
air-conditioning vent. The side arms squeeze tightly to lock your phone 
in place and a cable clip allows you to charge your phone and lock the 
cable in place. With aluminum arms and a carefully engineered pinion 
spring, you shouldn’t have to worry about your phone slipping or 
falling. Soft pads on the back and sides of the mount should keep your 
phone free from scratches.</p>

<h2>The best phone charging accessories</h2>
<p>A very real panic sets in every time you see your phone battery dying
 and know that you won’t be able to get to your charger on time. 
Luckily, there are a bunch of charging accessories available to make 
sure that this isn’t a problem. From multi-port wall chargers great for 
travel, to car chargers, and many power banks, here’s a roundup of all 
the best phone chargers and charging accessories you’ll need.</p>
<h3>What should you look for when choosing a third-party charger?</h3>
<p>On the surface, picking the best phone charging accessories sounds 
easy. There are thousands of products available and all you need to do 
is find the right fit. However, having so many options causes the 
problem.</p>
<p>It’s important to do your homework regardless of what you buy, but 
that’s even more so with a charger. A bad charger or cable can cause 
irreparable damage to the phone, and a faulty power bank in your pocket 
might hurt you as well. There are a lot of good choices, but it’s 
crucial to do the research properly.</p>
<p>There are also a few other factors to consider.</p>
<ul> <li>How fast is it going to charge? You might have gotten a power 
bank with a 50,000Ah battery or a wall charger with 10 ports, but if it 
takes all day to charge up your device, that will be a problem. The best
 options should ideally support the fast charging standards in your 
phone or other portable devices.</li> <li>What capacity do you need? For
 power banks getting one with the largest capacity might not be enough. 
Portability is a concern, since you don’t want to carry what is 
essentially a brick in your backpack. But if you need something smaller,
 there are a lot of great options. 10,000mAh is what I’d consider the 
sweet spot, but entirely depends on what your needs are.</li> <li>Does 
it have the right ports for your needs? Older or budget chargers often 
have less than great port options. There might just be USB type-A 
instead of USB-C, or there might not be fast charging as mentioned 
above. Figure out which ports you have on your devices and whether the 
charger that catches your eye fully supports your device. Larger 
charging stations even let you know charge laptops.</li> <li>Is the 
brand trustworthy? A reputable brand is more likely to last through 
countless charging cycles. We highly recommend Anker and Aukey, but 
there are tons of other great brands. We ensure every option on this 
list balances price, quality, and reputation.</li> <li>What size do you 
need? You will also have to consider the size. Do you want something 
that can easily slip inside your pocket or backpack? Or do you want the 
most charging power encased in a big brick of a portable charger? How

<h3>The best wireless chargers</h3>
<p>Samsung Wireless Charger DUO Pad</p>
<p>The Samsung Duo pad is as good as it gets with wireless charging 
pads. As the name suggests, the pad can charge two devices 
simultaneously. However, the Samsung wireless charger duo pad takes it a
 step forward by including fast charging support. This means that you 
can charge compatible Samsung phones at up to 15W, while charging an 
additional phone or perhaps your <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-true-wireless-workout-earbuds-963925/">wireless earphones</a> on the second pad.</p>
<p>If you have a Samsung phone, smartwatch, and wireless earbuds, you might want to consider the <a href="https://geni.us/9MAkQh">Samsung Trio pad</a> instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://geni.us/RaKAWf" rel="noopener"></a></p><p><a href="https://geni.us/RaKAWf" rel="noopener">Anker</a></p><p></p>
<p>The Anker PowerWave II wireless charger is similar to other 
affordable wireless charging pad offerings with one key difference. The 
pad sits at an angle and lets you view the phone’s display while 
charging. It’ll charge the Pixel 4 and LG flagships at 15W. With Samsung
 hardware, the pad enables fast wireless charging to the tune of 10W. 
However, it is as good as the best wireless chargers available for the 
iPhone and can top it off at 7.5W.</p>

<h3>Belkin wireless charging pad</h3>
<p><a href="https://geni.us/z11gaj" rel="noopener"></a></p><p><a href="https://geni.us/z11gaj" rel="noopener">Belkin</a></p><p></p>
<p>The Belkin wireless charging pad is designed to offer up to 15W of 
fast charging for Samsung, Apple, and Google smartphones that support 
it. Every other Qi-enabled device will be charged at 5W, including 
Apple’s Airpods and other <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-wireless-earbuds-984674/">true wireless earbuds</a>.
 Since Apple doesn’t have a first-party wireless charger yet, the Belkin
 wireless charging pad is an excellent option to consider.</p>

<p>RAVPower 20,000mAh PD Power Bank</p>
<p>The RAVPower 20,000mAh PD Power Bank is a great compact option. It’s 
small enough to fit in most pockets and easy to store in your purse or 
backpack. Despite its small size, it has a great charging capacity. It 
has 78W total output, with a 60W USB-C PD port, and can charge two 
devices at the same time. Plus, the 18W charging input helps the device 
recharge up to twice as fast as standard portable chargers.</p>

<p>Look no further than the Anker PowerLine III Plus to see just what we
 mean. It’s a USB-IF-certified USB-C to USB-C cable that comes in a 
convenient six-foot length. If you’re talking speed, the PowerLine III 
Plus supports 60W Power Delivery charging. Even better, the cable is 
fiber-wrapped from one end to the other and can endure 35,000 bends and 
tugs.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="http://tyvm.ly/a1BbO2j">Pick up a Powerline III Plus</a></p>
<p>Another high-speed cable offering from Anker is the Intel-certified 
Thunderbolt 3 cable. It tops out at speeds of 100W and rapid 40Gbps data
 transfer. If there’s a drawback it’s that the Thunderbolt 3 is just 
1.6-feet long. The Thunderbolt 3 cable is also backward compatible with 
previous generations of USB-C chargers.</p>

<h2>The best Bluetooth accessories</h2>
<p>Lily Katz / Android Authority</p>
<p>There’s a good chance that you already have a lot of Bluetooth 
accessories around the house. From earphones and speakers to keyboards 
and gaming controllers, Bluetooth is a versatile connectivity option 
that lets you go completely wireless. It’s far from perfect, of course. 
Range and connection problems are common, and audiophiles, in 
particular, are a long way from coming around to Bluetooth audio.</p>
<p>There’s no denying the convenience of going wireless though, and 
there are a bunch of Bluetooth accessories to enhance your phone 
experience. Let’s take a look!</p>
<h3>The best Bluetooth earbuds</h3>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus</p>
<p><a href="https://andauth.co/GalaxyBudsPlus-O" rel="noopener"></a></p><p><a href="https://andauth.co/GalaxyBudsPlus-O" rel="noopener">Lily Katz / Android Authority</a></p><p></p>
<p>For most people, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus is the best true 
wireless earbuds around: they’re not too expensive, afford a host of 
features, and boast a long battery life and pocketable charging case. 
Sure, these aren’t the most beautiful earbuds, but they meet the needs 
of most listeners. If battery life and functionality are your main 
concerns, in particular, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus is king.</p>

<p>Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2</p>
<p>One of the best true wireless options available is the <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-40848/">Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2.</a>
 When an old industry leader comes in with a high-end product, we pay 
attention and so should you. Sennheiser’s debut into the true wireless 
field offered sound quality that was extremely good, and its successor 
is even better. It’s expensive, but one of the best you can get in this 
category.</p>

<h3>The best Bluetooth speakers</h3>
<p>JBL Charge 5</p>
<p><a href="http://tyvm.ly/A4xgyE" rel="noopener"></a></p><p><a href="http://tyvm.ly/A4xgyE" rel="noopener">JBL</a></p><p></p>
<p>JBL is one of the top brands when it comes to Bluetooth speakers, and
 to no surprise, they are our top pick here as well. The Charge 5 is a 
perfect compromise between a speaker that sounds good but is still tough
 enough to bring to the beach. Like the Charge 4 before it, it’s still 
wrapped in an IPX7 waterproof fabric that protects it from any water 
damage. You can expect excellent battery life, and it charges via USB-C 
which is nice for anyone looking to future-proof their devices.</p>

<p>Marshall Stanmore II</p>
<p>The Marshall Stanmore II continues the sonic legacy defined by its 
predecessor with upgraded amplifiers, improved Bluetooth capabilities, 
and additional tuning controls for a bespoke listening experience. This 
speaker features Marshall’s signature guitar-amp design which screams 
“audiophile”. However, the Stanmore II isn’t just for show, producing a 
sound signature that caters to virtually any genre. If you need the best
 of the best in terms of sound quality, and are willing to pay a 
premium, the Stanmore II may be the speaker for you.</p>

<h2>MicroSD cards and external storage</h2>
<p>Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority</p>
<p>If you’ve bought a new camera, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-laptops-930116/">laptop</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-phones-568001/">phone</a>, or <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-gaming-consoles-1100651/">game console</a>
 recently, it’s always good to have extra storage. As we continue to do 
more and more on our phones, expandable storage is quickly becoming one 
of the essential phone accessories to get.</p>
<p>As far as additional storage for phones is concerned, the good news 
is that microSD card support is once again available on a lot of new 
smartphones, after going away entirely a few years ago. If your phone 
doesn’t have a microSD card slot, you can still get an external USB 
flash drive to address your storage needs.</p>
<h3>What to look for when buying additional storage for your phone</h3>
<p>It’s easy to want to buy as much storage as possible to make sure 
that you never have to worry about it again. Not only can get this get 
extremely expensive, but compatibility may be an issue, particularly 
with microSD cards.</p>
<p>Storage capacity and compatibility</p>
<p>Pay attention to storage specs of your phone. Some phones, especially
 those that are ultra-affordable, may support microSD cards with a 
capacity of up to only 32GB. You shouldn’t run into the problem with 
mid-rangers and flagships, but it’s information worth knowing before 
making a purchase.</p>
<p>If you plan to use an external flash drive, make sure that the phone supports USB OTG.</p>
<p>The numbers and symbols on a microSD card</p>
<ul> <li>Speed class: MicroSD cards are measured in speed classes: 2, 4,
 6, 10, U1, and U3, although anything below class 10 is no longer worth 
considering. This shows the minimum write speeds, but it’s important to 
be aware of the theoretical maximum. The faster the better. A standard 
microSD card for your mobile phone should ideally be class 10 U1, but 
you must look at those with a video speed class if you plan to shoot a 
lot of high-quality videos.</li> <li>Video Speed Class: This is denoted 
with a V and followed by a number, which represents the speed in Mbps. 
So, a V30 card will support a minimum write speed of 30Mbps. Video Speed
 Class is rated as V6, V10, V30, V60, and V90. Cards labeled with a 
Video Speed Class are designed to support those high video resolutions 
like 4K, 8K, 3D, 360-degree, and virtual reality.</li> <li>App 
performance Class: The App Performance Class denotes which MicroSD cards
 are best for smartphones and tablets. The A1 and A2 rating means that 
the card can open apps and process apps quickly. The A2 rating more than
 doubles the minimum read and write speeds available with cards rated 
A1.</li> </ul>
<h3>Our recommendations</h3>
<p>SanDisk Extreme Pro</p>
<p>The SanDisk Extreme Pro is a great option from one of the most 
popular microSD card brands, and is one of the fastest on the market. In
 terms of data transfer, you can reach speeds of up to 170Mbps with the 
Extreme Pro. This microSD card is ideal for those who want to take 4K 
videos. You can choose anywhere from 64GB up to 1TB of storage with the 
SanDisk Extreme Pro microSD card.</p>

advantage of the fast read and write speeds available with the USB 3.1 
Gen 1 drive, and as long as your phone supports USB OTG, all you need to
 do is plug it in. Storage options start from 32GB and go all the up to 
256GB.</p>

<h2>The best fitness trackers and smartwatches</h2>
<p>Fitness trackers and smartwatches have both come a long way in a very
 short amount of time. Fitness trackers are no longer glorified 
pedometers; most standard fitness trackers can track your steps taken, 
distance traveled, caloric burn, and even your sleeping patterns.</p>
<p>Smartwatches take functionality to a whole other level, and some are 
almost an ultra-mini smartphone on your wrist. They can provide you with
 an effortless way to get information, allow you to dismiss or reply to 
new messages without having to pull out your phone, and much more.</p>
<h3>Fitness trackers vs smartwatches</h3>
<p>Before we get into it, let’s talk about an important distinction — 
smartwatches vs fitness trackers. For the sake of this article, we are 
referring to devices with big displays that prioritize <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-fitbit-apps-1037408/">apps</a>
 and notifications as smartwatches. For devices that have smaller 
displays and look more like a traditional fitness band, we’ll refer to 
those as fitness trackers.</p>
<h3>The best fitness trackers</h3>
<p>Fitbit Charge 4</p>
<p>The Fitbit Charge 4 is the best fitness tracker you can buy, period. 
Fitbit didn’t need to do much to achieve this title again, but it fixed 
all our gripes with the Charge 3 and kept it at the same price point. 
The built-in <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-gps-running-watches-743124/">GPS</a> is welcome, as is <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-pay-features-861536/">Fitbit Pay</a> being standard <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-charge-4-1095139/">across all models</a>. The only reason you should consider buying another wearable at this price point is if you want a more <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-smartwatches-706178/">smartwatch-y experience</a>. Then, I’d recommend you go for the <a href="https://geni.us/qyjkluA">Fitbit Versa 3</a> or the <a href="https://geni.us/uxurQy">Fitbit Sense</a>.</p>

<h3>The best smartwatches</h3>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Watch 3</p>
<p><a href="https://andauth.co/BuyGalaxyWatch3" rel="noopener"></a></p><p><a href="https://andauth.co/BuyGalaxyWatch3" rel="noopener">Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority</a></p><p></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 is one of the best smartwatches you can 
buy if you don’t use an iPhone. The hardware is top-notch, the rotating 
bezel is useful and intuitive, battery life is good, and it has plenty 
of fitness- and health-tracking features.</p>
<p>Samsung’s GPS and heart rate sensors can be quite off at times, 
though, and those coming from a Wear OS or Apple Watch will likely find 
the lack of third-party apps to be a letdown.</p>

<h2>The best mobile camera accessories</h2>
<p>Many of today’s smartphone users utilize their phone as their main 
camera. If you are to replace your traditional camera with a phone, 
adding some smartphone photography accessories to your bag is 
recommended. These mobile photography accessories can improve your 
experience, as well as image quality. While it helps, you may not even 
need one of the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-camera-phones-670620/">best smartphone cameras</a> to shoot great images. Even a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/professional-photographer-cheap-smartphone-camera-967007/">cheap device can produce amazing photos</a> if given some help.</p>

<h3>Smartphone tripods</h3>
<h3>The best octopus smartphone tripod</h3>
<p>The smartphone tripod with flexible legs we would recommend is the 
JOBY GorillaPod 1K Kit. You can use it with both cameras and 
smartphones, and the stand and ballhead are both included (although you 
can purchase only the stand). It’s durable, but also portable with a 
weight of 0.43lbs. Its load capacity is 2.2lbs, which means you can use 
it with a variety of devices.</p>
<p>Other GorillaPod versions can carry more equipment, but we recommend 
this one because it costs much less and it will handle your smartphone 
with no issues.</p>

<p>Moment is one of the most respected companies in smartphone 
photography. The company offers camera cases for iPhones, Samsung,

<p>Moment’s lenses include a wide-angle, a 58mm telephoto, a Superfish 
for taking super-wide 170 degrees fisheye images, and a Macro lens, 
among others. Add-on lenses for smartphones cost anywhere between $80 
and $150, while all of the Moment photo cases cost $39.99 each. Some

<h3>The best selfie sticks</h3>
<p>Atumtek Selfie Stick Tripod</p>
<p>What makes this Atumtek product one of the best selfie sticks is that
 it’s made with heavy-duty aluminum that has both great construction and
 functionality. It can also extend up to 31.3 inches and doubles as a 
tripod with legs that fold out and you can take shots from a distance 
using the detachable Bluetooth remote. It helps that the selfie stick 
also happens to look great.</p>
