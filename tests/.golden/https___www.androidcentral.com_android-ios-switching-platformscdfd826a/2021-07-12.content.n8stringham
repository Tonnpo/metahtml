<h1 class="rm-manual">Why Apple doesn't care that a quarter of all iPhone users eventually switch to Android</h1>

<p>Apple doesn't care that nearly 26% of its users switch to different 
platforms between quarters because it is focusing on encouraging users 
to buy all of the products in its broader functional ecosystem, experts 
say. They add that users are likely switching over to Android phones to 
save money.</p>
<p>During the Epic Games vs. Apple trial, internal documents showed 
evidence of "meaningful switching" of smartphone users 
quarter-over-quarter. The highest percentage of users switching was 
between Q1 2020 and Q2 2020, which saw 26% of users switch from iOS to 
Android. This timeframe is particularly interesting as it marks the 
period that typically follows the announcement and release of new 
iPhones.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Source: Apple</span></p>
<p>Nugget of data on iPhone customers switching platforms came out in the Epic v. Apple trial. </p>
<p>Apple submitted this to show people do switch (even if small) and therefore choice does exist.</p>
<p>Average iOS loyalty over this time period was 81%.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenBajarin/status/1391833113538400259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2021</a></p>
<p>Epic Games said during the trial that Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/03/apple-doesnt-want-to-be-android/">App Store is anti-competitive and monopolistic</a>,
 and doesn't allow developers to earn fairly. Apple said during the 
trial that "Epic wants us to be Android, but we don't want to be," and 
indicated that there needs to be a single highly curated App Store in 
order to protect users' privacy, security, and reliability.</p>
<p>Ben Bajarin, CEO and principal analyst at Creative Strategies in 
California, said in an interview that a lot of people thought the number
 of users switching away from Apple was a lot smaller, and that more 
people were switching away from Android.</p>
<p>"The point (Apple) was trying to make, and questionable as to whether
 it's a valid point, is that people do switch. They're certainly not 
switching 40% of the time, but they use that stat and say look 20% or 
somewhere north of that some, on a quarterly basis, do leave iOS to go 
to an Android," he said.</p>
<p>"Their point is that switching does happen, but again it goes both 
ways; there's growth to their platform. People do switch from Android to
 iOS, but in general, it's not a large number."</p>
<h2>Would having iMessage on Android make a difference?</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Source: Daniel Bader / Android Central</span></p>
<p>During the same trial between Epic Games and Apple, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-considered-bringing-imessage-android-but-chose-not">Apple was in favor of bringing iMessage</a>
 to Android as early as 2013. The company wasn't convinced that this 
would be the right move and said it would "take more than a marginally 
better app" to get users to switch to iMessage from the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">best Android Messaging apps</a> such as WhatsApp. Apple said that <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/imagining-world-where-imessage-came-android">iMessage on Android</a> "would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones."</p>
<p>Bajarin indicated that perhaps if Android phones had services like 
iMessage, the percentage of switching over might be higher, but it 
really isn't a factor for why users are switching now.</p>
<p>"My gut would say, maybe that number would be a little bit higher for
 someone who is just willing to try something different. But most of 
those people came back to iPhones for other reasons. I don't think 
iMessage alone is essentially a deal-breaker," he said. "Users just 
wanted to try something different. They tried it, vetted it, and was 
like I still prefer iOS."</p>
<h2>So why do users switch from iOS to Android?</h2>
<p><span>Source: Andrew Martonik / Android Central</span></p>
<p>Neil Shah, vice-president of research at Counterpoint Research, said 
in an interview that one reason many users switch is because they find 
better deals for other phones.</p>
<p>"Many iPhone users have been holding on to their phones longer, so by
 the time when they are ready to upgrade (they see that), the price of 
flagship new iPhones have gotten more expensive. So many users who can't
 afford and find an attractive carrier or OEM deal are likely to 
switch," he said, adding that a brand new OnePlus flagship is almost a 
third of the price of an iPhone flagship.</p>
<p>In China, users spend the most time in one or two apps such as 
WeChat, so it doesn't matter to them if they are on an iOS or Android.</p>
<p>Shah also explained that many iPhone users have hand-me-downs or 
refurbished phones, in which case the phone's user experience isn't 
optimum, "so when they are due for an upgrade, they are also likely to 
shift out of the iOS ecosystem unless they are locked in."</p>
<p>"There's also a case where some Android users might have moved to an 
iPhone but couldn't get used to the UI or felt claustrophobic coming 
from an open system like Android, so they switch back or out of an 
iPhone," he said.</p>
<p>And in some cases, the user is focused on what apps they are using 
most and don't necessarily care about the type of phone they're using, 
Shah added.</p>
<h2>When you buy a phone, you're buying a lifestyle and Apple has created that ecosystem</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Source: Apple</span></p>
<p>Shah added that Apple has also been a "master" at locking users into 
an ecosystem, making it difficult to switch to another platform. He said
 that smartphone users who are on their second or third smartphone are 
more likely to decide if an ecosystem benefits their lifestyle.</p>
<p>"Some smart users are also cognizant of being locked into an 
ecosystem and understand that switching costs especially for iOS and 
make their choices accordingly if they want to (switch) or not," he 
said.</p>
<p>In the case of Apple, the company has been able to lock down the 
integration of products in a seamless way, Shah said, creating a sense 
of "premium-ness."</p>
<p>Lifestyle and premium-ness becomes a factor for aspiration and also 
actually choosing the ecosystem," Shah said. "For example, premium-ness 
of the Apple Watch of the seamlessness of AirPods or sticky features 
such as the AirDrop within the Apple ecosystem are some good examples to
 attract users to the Apple iPhone and its ecosystem.</p>
<h2>I don't see a cohesive roadmap for Google to take on Apple's ecosystem</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Source: Chris Wedel/Android Central</span></p>
<p>Carmi Levy, a technology analyst, said that the percentage of users 
that fall under the category looking for a better deal lies somewhere 
around 20%, and that number is going down every year.</p>
<p>You're not just buying a device, you're buying a lifestyle, and 
you're buying services, so as time goes on, that window for selling just
 the phone is getting smaller.</p>
<p>He added that a good percentage of those people do not see phones as 
part of a broader ecosystem. "I think over time, that percentage of the 
overall market is getting smaller. In other words, as time goes on, more
 and more smartphone consumers are beginning to see phones as not just 
devices, but as centers of a broader ecosystem that they are buying 
into," he said.</p>
<p>Levy says that this shift has tilted towards Apple's advantage 
because the company has "arguably the most highly evolved ecosystems of 
services in the entire market," adding that Google has struggled to find
 its way with building an ecosystem.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wear-os-google-samsung">Google announced it has teamed up with Samsung</a> for all future smartwatch efforts and to create a "unified experience."</p>
<p>Levy explained that WearOS has arguably been a disaster since day one
 and has gone through multiple rebranding efforts. But even this 
partnership hasn't convinced Levy that Google will be able to create an 
ecosystem that can compete with Apple's</p>
<p>"Google wishes that it were in a position, certainly throwing 
anything at the wall to try to regain some kind of traction and thus far
 has failed and there's no guarantee that its recently announced 
partnership with Samsung is going to succeed where previous efforts have
 failed," he said. "I don't see a cohesive roadmap for Google that would
 realistically take Apple on in this way."</p>
