<p class="rm-manual"> <span>PRESS RELEASE</span> <span>April 20, 2021</span> </p>
<h1> Apple introduces new iPad Pro featuring breakthrough M1 chip, ultra-fast 5G, and stunning 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display </h1>
<p> The M1 chip and 5G speeds enable the new iPad Pro to push the limits of what’s possible on iPad. </p>
<p><span>Cupertino, California</span> Apple today announced the most 
powerful and advanced iPad Pro ever, pushing the limits of what’s 
possible on iPad. The addition of the Apple-designed M1 chip delivers a 
massive leap in performance, making iPad Pro the fastest device of its 
kind. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro features a new Liquid Retina XDR display 
that brings extreme dynamic range to iPad Pro, offering a stunning 
visual experience with more true-to-life details to the most demanding 
HDR workflows. Cellular models with 5G deliver even faster wireless 
connectivity when on the go, and to provide users with pro-level 
throughput for high-speed accessories, iPad Pro now includes support for
 Thunderbolt. Additionally, an all-new Ultra Wide front camera enables 
Center Stage, a new feature that automatically keeps users perfectly 
framed for even more engaging video calls. The new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> is available to order beginning Friday, April 30, on apple.com, and will be available in the second half of May </p>
<p>“The revolutionary M1 chip has been a breakthrough for the Mac, and 
we’re incredibly excited to bring it to iPad Pro,” said Greg Joswiak, 
Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “With M1’s huge 
jump in performance, a groundbreaking extreme dynamic range experience 
on the 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, up to 2TB of high-speed 
storage, Thunderbolt expansion, a four-speaker audio system, pro cameras
 with LiDAR Scanner, blazing-fast 5G connectivity, an amazing 
video-calling experience with Center Stage — combined with the advanced 
features of iPadOS and a powerful pro app ecosystem all in a device 
users can hold in one hand — there’s nothing else like iPad Pro.” </p>
<p> With its incredibly thin and light design, iPad Pro is more powerful than ever. </p>
<h2>M1 Comes to iPad Pro </h2>
<p>The breakthrough M1 chip takes the industry-leading performance of 
iPad Pro to an entirely new level. The 8-core CPU design features the 
world’s fastest CPU cores in low-power silicon — delivering up to 50 
percent faster CPU performance than A12Z Bionic. The 8-core GPU is in a 
class of its own, delivering up to 40 percent faster GPU performance. 
This combination of CPU and graphics performance on iPad Pro widens its 
lead as the fastest device of its kind. Powerful custom technologies, 
including a next-generation 16-core Apple Neural Engine, an advanced 
image signal processor (ISP), a unified, high-bandwidth memory 
architecture with up to 16GB of memory, 2x faster storage, and up to 2TB
 capacity, make iPad Pro more capable than ever. The industry-leading 
power efficiency of M1 enables all of that amazing performance along 
with all-day battery life in the thin and light design of iPad Pro.1 
Because M1 shares the same fundamental architecture of A-series chips, 
iPadOS is already optimized to take full advantage of the powerful 
technologies in M1 to easily handle everything from simple navigation to
 the most demanding workflows. </p>
<p> Powerful custom technologies inside the M1 chip help iPad Pro take on every pro workflow. </p>
<h2>12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR Display Brings Extreme Dynamic Range to iPad Pro </h2>
<p>The new Liquid Retina XDR display brings the stunning front-of-screen
 performance of the Pro Display XDR to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. 
Engineered with a new cutting-edge mini-LED design that uses over 10,000
 LEDs across the entire back of the display, the Liquid Retina XDR 
display features up to 1000 nits of full-screen brightness, 1600 nits of
 peak brightness, and a phenomenal 1 million-to-1 contrast ratio to 
enhance creative workflows. The result is a stunning visual experience 
that reflects what can be seen in the real world by capturing the 
brightest highlights and the most subtle details in even the darkest 
images. Now creative professionals, including photographers, 
videographers, and filmmakers, can view and edit true-to-life HDR 
content on a large display they can take anywhere. The new Liquid Retina
 XDR display includes other advanced technologies that can also be found
 in the 11-inch iPad Pro, including ProMotion, True Tone, and P3 wide 
color support, delivering an unmatched mobile cinematic viewing 
experience for HDR and Dolby Vision content. </p>
<p> The Liquid Retina XDR display on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is the best display ever on iPad. </p>
<h2>Faster Speeds with 5G </h2>
<p>With 5G available on iPad Pro, customers on the go can do even more 
with better performance and access to next-generation download and 
upload speeds — great for higher-quality video streaming, real-time 
collaboration, or FaceTime in high definition. Users can stay creative 
and productive using a secure, fast connection, reducing the need to 
connect to public Wi-Fi hotspots. Featuring the most 5G bands on any 
device of its kind, iPad Pro offers the broadest 5G coverage worldwide. 
iPad Pro models in the US support millimeter wave, the higher frequency 
version of 5G, allowing iPad Pro to reach speeds up to 4Gbps. iPad Pro 
also features support for eSIM, making it easy to find a network and 
sign up for a 5G data plan on the spot.2 </p>
<p> 5G speeds allow everyone to stay connected and be creative whenever inspiration strikes. </p>
<h2>Thunderbolt Comes to iPad Pro </h2>
<p>Support for Thunderbolt and USB 4 makes the USB-C port on iPad Pro 
the fastest, most versatile port ever on an iPad, with 4x more bandwidth
 for wired connections than the previous iPad Pro — up to 40Gbps. 
Thunderbolt supports 10Gbps Ethernet and opens up a massive ecosystem of
 high-performance accessories, like faster external storage and even 
higher resolution external displays, including the Pro Display XDR at 
full 6K resolution, all connected using high-performance cables and 
docks. With support for more peripherals than ever, iPad Pro now fits 
even more seamlessly into creative workflows. </p>
<p>Thunderbolt and USB 4 support means users can now connect more accessories than ever to iPad Pro.</p>
<h2>Center Stage Delivers a New, More Engaging Experience for Video Calls </h2>
<p>The TrueDepth camera system on iPad Pro features an all-new 12MP 
Ultra Wide front camera designed specifically for iPad, enabling Center 
Stage, a new experience for video calls. Center Stage uses the much 
larger field of view on the new front camera and the machine learning 
capabilities of M1 to recognize and keep users centered in the frame. As
 users move around, Center Stage automatically pans to keep them in the 
shot. When others join in, the camera detects them too, and smoothly 
zooms out to fit everyone into the view and make sure they are part of 
the conversation. So whether whiteboarding with coworkers or attending a
 virtual family gathering, the experience of connecting is now more 
engaging than ever. </p>
<p>Center Stage takes advantage of the new 12MP Ultra Wide front camera on iPad Pro to keep everyone in frame.</p>
<h2>Additional New Features of iPad Pro </h2>
<ul> <li>The ISP and Neural Engine in M1 unlock even more capability 
from the pro camera system, bringing support for Smart HDR 3 for the 
first time to iPad Pro. And in low-light conditions, the ISP and LiDAR 
Scanner quickly and accurately focus images and videos to capture 
incredible details from almost no light at all.</li> </ul>
<ul> <li>The Magic Keyboard, which offers a comfortable typing 
experience with backlit keys, an integrated trackpad, and its floating 
design, now comes in a gorgeous new White color.</li> </ul>
<ul> <li>iPadOS 14.5, which will be available to iPad customers starting
 next week, comes with new additions, including expanded language 
support for Apple Pencil features like Scribble and Smart Selection, new
 emoji, support for the latest gaming controllers, and the ability to 
share lyrics and see top songs in cities around the world with Apple 
Music.</li> </ul>
