<p> DUBAI: Iran’s top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 
has replaced the chief commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards, 
state TV reported on Sunday, days after the United States designated the
 group a foreign terrorist organization.</p>
<p> The TV station did not give a reason for the change when it 
announced the appointment of Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami to the position.</p>
<p> “The Supreme Leader has appointed Salami as the new 
commander-in-chief of the Guards, who will replace Mohammad Ali Jafari,”
 it said. Jafari had held the post since September 2007.</p>
<p> President Donald Trump on April 8 designated the Guards a terrorist 
organization, in an unprecedented step that drew Iranian condemnation 
and raised concerns about retaliatory attacks on US forces. The 
designation took effect on April 15.</p>
<p> The Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) is in charge of Iran’s 
ballistic missile and nuclear programs. Tehran has warned that it has 
missiles with a range of up to 2,000 km (1,242 miles), putting Israel 
and US military bases in the region within reach.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> CAIRO: The Ministry of Health in Egypt has called on women to postpone their pregnancies because of the coronavirus.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> The ministry issued a statement saying that 
delaying pregnancy during the spread of COVID-19 was a necessity. It 
said new discoveries have linked the virus to blood clots that may 
affect the placenta and the fetus’ nutrition.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> The statement said that pregnancy may cause the 
indirect weakening of the immune system, making pregnant women 
vulnerable to the virus.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> “Use of contraceptives can be used to temporarily prevent pregnancy,” the statement said.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> The ministry also underlined the significance of 
staying active, relaxed and rested during the pregnancy. It said walking
 was considered the best form of exercise for pregnant women but that 
during the spread of the coronavirus it was not recommended that 
pregnant women leave home except for absolute necessities to avoid 
infection.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> The ministry explained that health units provided 
various birth control methods, including the Implanon capsule, a 
long-term method that lasts for three years. The capsule can be 
implanted easily and without a surgical procedure by specialized doctors
 in less than three minutes.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> The ministry confirmed that the capsule is 
suitable for most women as well as breastfeeding mothers, and is sold 
for five Egyptian pounds ($0.30).</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Egyptian doctor Zainab Abdel-Meguid, 40, said that
 the Health Ministry’s statement was correct but should have been issued
 earlier, when the virus initially emerged in Egypt in February, given 
the extreme risk that a pregnant woman may face.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Government employee Wagida Abdel-Latif said that 
the government’s announcement was important due to an already 
overwhelmed Egyptian health care system and its inability to accommodate
 patients who are suffering from the coronavirus.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Abdel-Latif is a mother of two, but said that even
 if she was not a mother she would have responded to the government’s 
request to postpone getting pregnant for her own safety and the safety 
of her future children.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Mervat Abdel-Karim, 29, does not agree with the 
ministry’s decision. She told Arab News that she is newly married, and 
that she disagrees with the ministry’s request because she wants to 
become a mother. Abdel-Karim’s husband shares her view as he wants to 
become a father.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Housewife Gamila Saeed has been trying to become 
pregnant for 14 years. But when she finally became pregnant, during her 
ninth month of pregnancy fears increased about her losing the fetus 
because of the virus.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> The isolation hospital in the village of 
Sinbillawain, in Daqahlia governorate in north Cairo, witnessed a birth 
days before the mother’s isolation period ended.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Dr. Mohamed El-Surugi, director of Al-Sinbillawain
 Hospital, explained that pregnant women suffering from the coronavirus 
are placed under continuous care even if the patient’s condition is 
stable, especially if the patient is nearing the end of her pregnancy.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> He said that the patient’s condition remained 
stable while she was receiving treatment by the medical staff checking 
on the health of the fetus.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> El-Surugi said that the delivery was supposed to 
be by caesarean due to the condition of the woman and the fetus, but the
 patient felt severe pain before her scheduled caesarean section, 
forcing the medical team to perform the operation earlier than expected.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Before childbirth a smear was taken from the woman
 to test if she was still carrying the virus. During the operation, 
preventive measures were taken to ensure her safety and that of the 
baby. After the operation, the smear results came back negative, much to
 the joy of the medical staff.</p>
