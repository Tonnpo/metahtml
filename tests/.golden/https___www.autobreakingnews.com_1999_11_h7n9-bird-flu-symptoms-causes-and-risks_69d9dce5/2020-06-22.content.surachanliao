 altogether, including 566 people affected by the current seasonal 
epidemic. During the first four seasonal epidemics, 40 percent of 
patients with H7N9 died. In March 2017, an outbreak of H7N9 was reported

infection is considered to be “low.” H7N9 is an avian, or bird, flu 
virus. The virus normally affects poultry birds, but it has mutated so
