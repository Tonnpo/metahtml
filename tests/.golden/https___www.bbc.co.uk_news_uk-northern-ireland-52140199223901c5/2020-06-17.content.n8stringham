<p>Healthcare resources have been redirected to treating infected patients <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-51827383">with many other procedures and appointments cancelled</a>.</p>
<p>But that has meant other people, who credit their lives to the NHS, accepting changes to their care.</p>
<p>Some of them have spoken to BBC News NI about adjusting to a reduction in service and support.</p>

<p>'How he survived coronavirus the first time is a miracle.'</p>
<p>When Ollie Grant survived an earlier strain of coronavirus as a newborn, his parents said it was "a miracle".</p>
<p>Ollie, now aged one, has incurable congenital heart disease, which makes him vulnerable to even minor illness.</p>
<p>After contracting a coronavirus - different to the one behind the 
current epidemic - he had a stroke and was airlifted to Birmingham 
hospital.</p>
<p>Ollie's parents said their son would not be alive without the NHS.</p>
<p>Now the are struggling to adapt to looking after him at home without their usual extensive NHS support.</p>
<figcaption> <span>Image caption</span> <span> Ollie Grant's family is missing weekly home care visits </span> </figcaption><p>Damien
 and Riona Grant, from Kilcoo, County Down, said physiotherapists, 
community nurses, speech and language and occupational therapists used 
to call weekly to their home to help care for Ollie.</p>
<p>They said that was no longer possible due to the risk of infection. 
Riona said it felt as if their "security network" had been taken away.</p>
<p>"You are never out of the woods with Ollie, but with all of the amazing support of the NHS we have learned to cope," she said. </p>
<p>"We miss the security of them coming to the house to look after him."</p>
<p>Riona urged people to continue to stay at home to support the NHS workers and protect children like Ollie.</p>
<p>"There is no cure for Ollie and if he was to catch it [Covid-19] he would not survive," she said.</p>
<p>Damien said they now "walked a tightrope" of assessing when it was worth the risk of bringing Ollie to hospital.</p>
<p>"We have to decide what is the greater risk when his oxygen levels 
are low - taking him to a doctor or trying to deal with it ourselves."</p>
<p>Damien said Ollie must attend his next hospital appointment in mid-April, which is categorised as urgent.</p>
<p>"The thought of bringing him to hospital, an area with a 
concentration of people who may be affected, is terrifying but we don't 
have a choice," he said.</p>
<p>A South Eastern Health Trust spokesperson confirmed there were not as
 many direct health care visits due to the virus, although telephone 
support was available. </p>
<p>Services were still available to respond to urgent and high risk 
issues or for families struggling to cope, the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>'Other mums are a lifeline'</p>
<p>Nicola Rothwell's son Austin, 12, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2018.</p>
<p>Austin was in intensive care for three months and spent a year learning to walk again.</p>
<p>He now attends regular clinics at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, for maintenance cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Nicola, from Belfast, said the clinics were now done as remotely as possible, which was "stressful, scary but necessary".</p>
<p>She said they were now allocated a slot by text message and advised 
to wait in the car park until they received another message to come 
inside.</p>
<p>Austin's blood results are also delivered by text.</p>
<figure> <span> <span>Image copyright</span> <span>family photo</span> </span> </figure><p>"I
 always had access to a consultant, which was reassuring, but now the 
only person Austin sees is the person who takes his blood. It's 
frightening for the children as well," said Nicola.</p>
<p>"I miss the support - talking to other mums in the waiting room can be a lifeline."</p>
<p>Nicola said she was always anxious attending clinics, but said it was
 now more frightening to take "an extremely vulnerable child into a 
hospital". </p>
<p>She said there had been a wider emotional toll on Austin as other support was scaled back due to the crisis.</p>
<p>He was devastated by the cancellation of a residential scheme at 
Daisy Lodge in Newcastle run by the Cancer Fund for Children, she said.</p>
<p>"The first residential helped him find his courage - it was the first
 in a long time I saw him be a 12-year-old boy again," she said. </p>
<p>"When we told him it couldn't happen he broke his heart."</p>
<p>Nicola said Daisy Lodge brought the children together virtually instead.</p>
<p>"To hear him laughing online with the rest of them at home was brilliant," she said.</p>
<p>"Families with children with cancer feel isolated enough, the pandemic is making it so much more difficult."</p>
<h2>'It will happen when it happens'</h2>
<p>David Hall was diagnosed with kidney cancer a week after his wedding in 2013.</p>
<p>He had six years of dialysis before having a double kidney transplant in February 2019.</p>
<p>David said the NHS had saved his life on more than one occasion and 
is now waiting for parathyroid surgery because of side effects of 
long-term kidney dialysis.</p>
<p>He said he had been advised his operation, which is classed as 
elective surgery, should be carried out "sooner rather than later".</p>
<p>But due to coronavirus, he said "there was uncertainty around whether it was going to happen and when".</p>
<figcaption> <span>Image caption</span> <span> Forty thousand people in Northern Ireland have received letters advising them to stay at home for 12 weeks </span> </figcaption><p>David
 is one of 40,000 vulnerable patients in Northern Ireland who received 
letters from their doctors this week advising them to self-isolate for 
12 weeks.</p>
<p>He said the main issues for waiting for surgery while waiting were "bone pain and potential fractures".</p>
<p>"An ongoing issue would be possible damage to the two transplanted kidneys - having two kidneys transplanted is rare," he added.</p>
<p>David said he had overcome so many hurdles since his diagnosis in 2013 that he was unperturbed by potential delays.</p>
<p>"There's no point in worrying about it, it will happen when it happens," he said.</p>
