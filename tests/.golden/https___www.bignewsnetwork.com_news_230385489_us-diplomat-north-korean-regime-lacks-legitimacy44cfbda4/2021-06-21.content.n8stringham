<p>WASHINGTON - A senior U.S. diplomat says the North Korean regime 
lacks legitimacy because of the hardship it causes to its citizens.</p>
<p>At a conference on North Korea this week, Robert King, the U.S. 
Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues, said the communist 
country continues to make human rights violations despite international 
concerns.</p>
<p>"When you look at North Korea, what it has done, and the lack of 
support it has in the international community, there is no question it 
does not have the legitimacy it seeks and claims that it has," King 
said.</p>
<p>The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a 
Washington-based think tank, hosted the conference Tuesday to mark the 
one year anniversary of a report by the United Nation's Commission of 
Inquiry (COI), which accused North Korea of committing crimes against 
humanity.</p>
<p>The conference in Washington drew strong protests from Pyongyang. The
 North Korean Permanent Mission to the U.N. issued a statement 
condemning the event, calling it a "political human rights plot" against
 the country.</p>
<p>Recently, Pyongyang launched an aggressive campaign to counter 
international criticisms over the country's human rights record. It has 
also challenged some of testimony given to the U.N. panel, which 
prompted a prominent North Korean defector to retract part of his story.
 Shin Dong-hyuk, a former inmate of a North Korean political prison 
camp, admitted publicly that part of his story about life in prison was 
not completely accurate.</p>
<p>Michael Kirby, a retired Australian judge who headed COI 
investigation, said the U.N. report still stands despite controversy 
over Shin's testimony, stressing Shin's actions are "immaterial" to the 
report's overall conclusion.</p>
<p>Kirby called on the U.N. Security Council to refer the North Korean 
human rights issue to the International Criminal Court. Last December, 
the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the council 
to consider referring the issue to the international court.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asia and Public Affairs Kurt
 Campbell, South Korea's Ambassador for Human Rights Jong-Hoon Lee and 
the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the DPRK
 Marzuki Darusman also spoke at Tuesday's event. Two North Korean 
defectors told their stories.</p>
