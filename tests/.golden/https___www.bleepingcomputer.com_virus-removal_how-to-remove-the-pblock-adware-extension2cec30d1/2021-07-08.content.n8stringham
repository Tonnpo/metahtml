<p>This removal guide may appear overwhelming due to the amount of the 
steps and numerous programs that will be used. It was only written this 
way to provide clear, detailed, and easy to understand instructions that
 anyone can use to remove this infection for free. Before using this 
guide, we suggest that you read it once and download all necessary tools
 to your desktop. After doing so, please print this page as you may need
 to close your browser window or reboot your computer.</p>
<p> <span>2</span> </p>
<p>To terminate any programs that may interfere with the removal process
 we must first download the Rkill program. Rkill will search your 
computer for active malware infections and attempt to terminate them so 
that they wont interfere with the removal process. To do this, please 
download RKill to your desktop from the following link.</p>
<h5 class="">Rkill</h5>
<p class=""> <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/">Download Now</a> </p>
<p class="">When at the download page, click on the Download Now button 
labeled iExplore.exe. When you are prompted where to save it, please 
save it on your desktop.</p>
<p> <span>3</span> </p>
<p>Once it is downloaded, double-click on the iExplore.exe icon in order
 to automatically attempt to stop any processes associated with PBlock+ 
adware browser extension and other malware. Please be patient while the 
program looks for various malware programs and ends them. When it has 
finished, the black window will automatically close and a log file will 
open. Please review the log file and then close so you can continue with
 the next step. If you have problems running RKill, you can download the
 other renamed versions of RKill from the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/">rkill download page</a>.
 All of the files are renamed copies of RKill, which you can try 
instead. Please note that the download page will open in a new browser 
window or tab.</p>
<p>Do not reboot your computer after running RKill as the malware programs will start again. </p>
<p> <span>4</span> </p>
<p> At this point you should download Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, or 
MBAM, to scan your computer for any infections, adware, or potentially 
unwanted programs that may be present. Please download Malwarebytes from
 the following location and save it to your desktop:</p>
<h5>Malwarebytes Anti-Malware</h5>
<p> <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/malwarebytes-anti-malware/">Download Now</a> </p>
<p> <span>5</span> </p>
<p>Once downloaded, close all programs and Windows on your computer, including this one.</p>
<p> <span>6</span> </p>
<p>Double-click on the icon on your desktop named 
MBSetup-1878.1878-4.0.exe. This will start the installation of MBAM onto
 your computer.</p>
<p> <span>7</span> </p>
<p>When the installation begins, keep following the prompts in order to 
continue with the installation process. Do not make any changes to 
default settings and when the program has finished installing, a welcome
 screen will be displayed.</p>
<p>At this screen, click on the Get Started button where you will be 
prompted to buy and activate a license. To continue using it for free, 
click on the 'Maybe Later' option and then select 'Use Malwarebytes 
Free'. </p>
<p>It should be noted that the free version will scan for and remove 
malware, but not provide real-time protection from threats that occur 
when not performing a scan.</p>
<p>Finally, you will be shown a screen asking you to sign up for their 
newsletter. Just click on the 'Open Malwarebytes Free' option to start 
the program.</p>
<p> <span>8</span> </p>
<p>MBAM will now start and you will be at the main screen as shown below.</p>
<p>We now need to enable rootkit scanning to detect the largest amount 
of malware and unwanted programs that is possible with MalwareBytes. To 
do this, click on the Settings gear on the top left side of the screen 
and you will be brought to the general settings section.</p>
<p>Now click on the Security option at the top of the screen. You will 
now be shown the settings MalwareBytes will use when scanning your 
computer.</p>
<p>Scroll down until you see Scan option as shown below.</p>
<p>At this screen, please enable the Scan for rootkits setting by clicking on the toggle switch so it turns blue.</p>
<p>Now that you have enabled rootkit scanning, click on the X button to close the settings to get back to the main screen.</p>
<p> <span>9</span> </p>
<p>You should now click on the Scan button to begin scanning your computer for malware.</p>
<p>This process can take quite a while, so we suggest you do something 
else and periodically check on the status of the scan to see when it is 
finished.</p>
<p> <span>10</span> </p>
<p>When MBAM is finished scanning it will display a screen that displays
 any malware, adware, or potentially unwanted programs that it has 
detected. Please note that our guide's scan results image may look 
different than the one you are shown in this version of Malwarebytes as 
it was created with an older version.</p>
<p>You should now click on the Quarantine button to remove all the 
selected items. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys 
and add them to the program's quarantine.</p>
<p>When removing the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove
 some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot,
 please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are 
logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.</p>
<p> <span>11</span> </p>
<p>You can now exit the MBAM program.</p>
<p> <span>12</span> </p>
<p>At this point you should download Zemana AntiMalware, or ZAM, in 
order to scan your computer for any any infections, adware, or 
potentially unwanted programs that may be present. Please download 
Zemana AntiMalware from the following location and save it to your 
desktop:</p>
<h5>Zemana AntiMalware</h5>
<p> <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/zemana-antimalware/dl/312/">Download Now</a> </p>
<p> <span>13</span> </p>
<p>Once downloaded, close all programs and open windows on your computer.</p>
<p> <span>14</span> </p>
<p>Now double-click on the icon on your desktop named 
Zemana.AntiMalware.Setup.exe. This will start the installation of Zemana
 AntiMalware onto your computer.</p>
<p> <span>15</span> </p>
<p>When the installation begins, keep following the prompts in order to 
continue with the installation process. Do not make any changes to 
default settings and when the program has finished installing, Zemana 
will automatically start and display the main screen.</p>
<p> <span>16</span> </p>
<p>You will now be at the main screen for Zemana AntiMalware as shown below.</p>
<p>Above the Scan button, please change the scan type to Deep Scan and 
then click on the Scan button to start the malware removal scan.</p>
<p> <span>17</span> </p>
<p>Zemana AntiMalware will now start scanning your computer for malware,
 adware, and potentially unwanted programs. This process can take quite a
 while, so we suggest you do something else and periodically check on 
the status of the scan to see when it is finished.</p>
<p> <span>18</span> </p>
<p>When Zemana has finished finished scanning it will display a screen 
that displays any programs that have been detected. Please note that the
 items found may be different than what is shown in the image below.</p>
<p>Review the scan results and when you are ready to continue with the 
cleanup process, click on the Next button to delete or repair all of the
 the selected results. Once you click on the Next button, Zemana will 
remove any unwanted files and fix any modified legitimate files. If you 
receive a warning that Zemana needs to close your open browsers, please 
close any web browsers that may be open and then click on the OK button 
to continue.</p>
<p>Zemana will now create a System Restore Point and remove the detected files and repair any files that were modified. </p>
<p> <span>19</span> </p>
<p>When the process is complete, you will be shown a screen that says 
Completed. At this screen, you can now close the Zemana AntiMalware 
screen and continue with the rest of the instructions.</p>
<p> <span>20</span> </p>
<p>Now please download AdwCleaner and save it to your desktop. 
AdwCleaner will scan your computer for adware programs that may have 
been installed on your computer without your knowledge. You can download
 AdwCleaner from the following URL:</p>
<h5>AdwCleaner</h5>
<p> <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/">Download Now</a> </p>
<p> <span>21</span> </p>
<p>When AdwCleaner has finished downloading, please double-click on the 
AdwCleaner.exe icon that now appears on your desktop. Once you 
double-click on the icon the AdwCleaner program will open and you will 
be presented with the program's license agreement. After you read it, 
click on the I agree button if you wish to continue. Otherwise, click on
 the I disagree button to close the program. If Windows prompts you as 
to whether or not you wish to run AdwCleaner, please allow it to run.</p>
<p>If you selected to continue, you will be presented with the start screen as shown below.</p>
<p> <span>22</span> </p>
<p>Now click on the Scan button in AdwCleaner. The program will now 
start to search for known adware programs that may be installed on your 
computer. When it has finished it will display all of the items it has 
found in Results section of the screen above. Please look through the 
results and try to determine if the programs that are listed contain 
ones that you do not want installed. If you find programs that you need 
to keep, then uncheck the entries associated with them.</p>
<p>For many people, the contents of the Results section may appear 
confusing. Unless you see a program name that you know should not be 
removed,please continue with the next step.</p>
<p> <span>23</span> </p>
<p>To remove the adware programs that were detected in the previous 
step, please click on the Clean button on the AdwCleaner screen. 
AdwCleaner will now prompt you to save any open files or data as the 
program will need to close any open programs before it starts to clean.</p>
<p>Please save your work and then click on the OK button. AdwCleaner 
will now delete all detected adware from your computer. When it is done 
it will display an alert that explains what PUPs (Potentially Unwanted 
Programs) and Adware are. Please read through this information and then 
press the OK button. You will now be presented with an alert that states
 AdwCleaner needs to reboot your computer.</p>
<p>Please click on the OK button to let AdwCleaner reboot your computer.</p>
<p> <span>24</span> </p>
<p>When your computer reboots and you are logged in, AdwCleaner will 
automatically open a log file that contains the files, registry keys, 
and programs that were removed from your computer.</p>
<p>Please review this log file and then close the Notepad Window.</p>
<p> <span>25</span> </p>
<p>If you are still having problems with PBlock+ adware browser
