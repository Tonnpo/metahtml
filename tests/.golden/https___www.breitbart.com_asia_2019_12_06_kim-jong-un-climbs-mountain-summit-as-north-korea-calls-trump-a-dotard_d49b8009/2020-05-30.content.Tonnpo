<h1 class="rm-manual">Kim Jong-un Climbs Mountain Summit as North Korea Calls Trump a ‘Dotard’</h1>
<figcaption class="rm-manual">Rodong Sinmun/North Korea</figcaption><address class="rm-manual"><a href="file:///author/frances-martel/">Frances Martel</a></address>
<p class="rm-manual">6 Dec 2019</p>
<p class="">The North Korean state newspaper Rodong Sinmun published an 
extensive library of photos of Kim Jong-un on Thursday scaling Mount 
Paektu, the highest peak on the Korean peninsula and a key historical 
and spiritual site for both North and South Koreans.</p>
<p>According to the newspaper, Kim traveled to the summit and toured a 
variety of “revolutionary” sites on horseback, navigated the heavy 
snowfall in the area to seek a rekindling of the “offensive spirit of 
Paektu.”</p>
<p>Rodong Sinmun‘s summary of his tour does not mention the United 
States, but warns that, “now that the rising generations emerge as the 
main force, new issues arise from the global political structure and 
social and class relations, and the imperialists and class enemies make a
 more frantic attempt to undermine the ideological, revolutionary and 
class positions of our Party.”</p>
<p>The tour hit the government propaganda outlet’s pages in the 
aftermath of a senior North Korean official declaring that Pyongyang 
would send Washington a “Christmas present,” but the nature of this gift
 depended on how conciliatory America would be to the communist regime.</p>
<p>“It is of remarkable historic significance that Kim Jong-un, the 
great leader of our revolution who opens up the period of a great leap 
for the development of the revolution,” Rodong Sinmun <a href="http://www.rodong.rep.kp/en/index.php?strPageID=SF01_02_01&amp;newsID=2019-12-04-0015">declared</a>,
 “personally left the sacred trace in the revolutionary battle sites in 
Mt Paektu area, the source of the lifeline of the revolution and 
inexhaustible patriotism, through knee-high virgin snow.”</p>
<p>His tour, Kim reportedly said, was “a manifestation of the rock-firm 
faith and immutable will of the Korean people to carry forward the 
glorious revolutionary traditions, the immortal foundation of the 
revolution, as the eternal lifeline, add everlasting luster to it and 
thoroughly implement the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered on 
Paektu.”</p>
<p>The images accompanying the report show a clunky Kim in a large coat 
riding a horse through the breathtaking terrain around Mount Paektu, 
warming himself with his team by a fire, and reaching the summit and its
 crater lake, Chon.</p>
<p>Mount Paetku is rich with mythological <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-kimjongun-explainer/the-north-korean-history-behind-kim-jong-uns-mountain-horse-ride-idUSKBN1WW1J9">significance</a>,
 considered the birthplace of the Korean people and the mountains to 
which Kim Il-sung, the founder of the Kim cult, fled during his battles 
with the Japanese that ended with him taking the reins of North Korea 
and imposing arguably the most brutal form of communism still in effect 
today. The North Korean regime claimed Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un’s 
predecessor and father, was born on the mountain.</p>
<p>Last year, in a gesture meant to symbolize Kim Jong-un’s willingness to thaw relations with the south, he <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2018/09/20/kim-moon-mount-paektu/">toured</a>
 the summit of Mount Paektu with leftist South Korean President Moon 
Jae-in, who said that climbing the mountain was a lifelong dream.</p>
<p>The newspaper also affirmed the catchy slogan “Let us produce, study 
and live like the anti-Japanese guerrillas!” as a core command of the 
Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK), Kim’s communist cult. Imperial Japan 
committed a host of human rights atrocities against Koreans and 
colonized Chinese during World War II that continues to be a point of 
contention in both Koreas. In the North, however, Kim Jong-un regularly 
uses his propaganda outlets to stoke resentment against the Japanese 
people and has continued testing short-range missiles that could reach 
Japan, even when limiting long-range tests that could threaten U.S. 
territories.</p>
<p>The South Korean news service Yonhap <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20191205003100325?section=nk/nk">suggested</a>
 that the combination of the Kim photo collections and essays by 
high-ranking officials urging North Koreans to embrace “self-reliance,” 
meaning a rejection of Western freedoms and acceptance of the hardships 
the non-elite endure under communism, were a sign that Pyongyang is not 
expecting any breakthroughs with the free world in the near future.</p>
<p>“As long as we have the revolutionary spirit of Mount Paekdu, and 
revolutionary spirit of self reliance, we can survive on our own and 
open the door for development and prosperity of our own style,” Yonhap 
quoted Vice Premier Kim Tok-hun as writing.</p>
<p>Choe Son Hui, North Korea’s first vice-minister of Foreign Affairs, 
also issued a statement Thursday carried by the Korean Central News 
Agency (KCNA), North Korea’s regime news service, <a href="https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1575615666-276354568/choe-son-hui-makes-statement">claiming</a> that the “waves of hatred of our people against the U.S. and the Americans … are getting higher and higher.”</p>
<p> “It would be fortunate if the utterances of the use of military 
force and the title of figurative style made by President [Donald] Trump
 were a careless verbal lapse, but matter becomes different if they were
 a planned provocation that deliberately targeted us,” Choe warned. “If 
any language and expressions stoking the atmosphere of confrontation are
 used once again on purpose at a crucial moment as now, that must really
 be diagnosed as the relapse of the dotage of a dotard.”</p>
<p>Trump, present at the NATO summit in London this week, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/12/05/north-korea-response-trump-remark/2617148001/">said</a>
 the United States would use military force against North Korea “if we 
have to,” then referred to Kim Jong-un once again as “Rocket Man,” a 
nickname he gave him, Trump explained, because he “likes to send rockets
 up, doesn’t he?”</p>
