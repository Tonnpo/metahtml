<p class="rm-manual">Jan. 22, 2018</p>
<p>In 2005, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/caseygueren/heres-what-44-women-want-you-to-know-about-their-abortions" rel="noreferrer">I had an abortion</a>.
 Living in New York City, I was fortunate enough that access to it was 
easy and I didn't have any holes to jump through, like being forced to 
wait a certain amount of time or listen to the heartbeat of the fetus. I
 was also fortunate, that from an emotional and mental perspective, 
there was no struggle. I knew it was the right thing for me to do at the
 time; I didn't hesitate, I didn't regret it, and, to this day, I stand 
by the fact that <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/97191-95-percent-of-women-who-have-gotten-abortions-still-believe-it-was-the-right-choice-new">my abortion was the best decision of my life</a>. Without that abortion, I'd have a 12-year-old today. And... I'd probably be living in my parents' basement. </p>
<p>But while I had it easy, in regards to access, it hasn't always been 
that way, of course, and while one would hope things would haven't 
gotten even better since 2005, that hasn't been the case. </p>
<p>Today, January 22, marks the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/reproductive-freedom/abortion/45th-anniversary-roe-v-wade-court-battles-abortion-access-persist" rel="noreferrer">45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade</a>,
 the landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court to make 
abortion legal. But while 45 years ago it was definitely a win for women
 and women's reproductive rights, the battle wages on, as they say, as <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-expand-reproductive-rights-in-america-in-2018-7741522">women's reproductive rights</a>
 are constantly on the chopping block. Although a woman's right to 
choose shouldn't even be entangled in politics, it is, and because of 
this, the accessibility to safe abortions is constantly hanging in the 
balance, especially social conservatives try their damnedest to restrict
 access, in the hopes of eventually eliminating it entirely.</p>
<p>"Since Roe v. Wade, politicians have chipped away at access," Debra Hauser, president of <a href="http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/about-us/advocates-staff" rel="noreferrer">Advocates for Youth</a>,
 tells Bustle. "They have created onerous and unnecessary restrictions 
that have closed down clinics. They have insisted on unnecessary waiting
 periods that result in added expenses for many women. For example, if a
 person has traveled potentially hundreds of miles just to get to a 
clinic where abortion care is available, they then may have to wait 
around for days to fulfill state law's waiting period â€” adding the 
price of additional nights in a hotel, food, and lost wages to the cost 
of care. In big cities, it is still possible to find a Planned 
Parenthood or independent abortion provider, walk in, and book an 
appointment. But in more rural areas, the process is challenging. In 
fact, over a third of women live in counties without any abortion 
provider at all."</p>
<p>But even before that landmark decision on January 22, 1973, women 
were still getting abortions. Women have, in fact, been getting 
abortions for as long as women have been getting pregnant â€” since the 
beginning of the human race. But while that history is fascinating unto 
itself, let's focus on the last 60 years. Here's what getting an 
abortion was like in the '60s, '70s, and '80s, compared to now. </p>
<h2>The 1960s</h2>
<p>"Before the legalization of abortion, women were known to have tried 
various herbs, poisons, pushing of foreign objects into the cervix, and 
even beatings to cause an abortion or miscarriage," Melissa Grant, COO 
of <a href="https://carafem.org/" rel="noreferrer">carafem Health</a>, 
tells Bustle. "In the 1960s, it is estimated that thousands of people 
attempted to abort with these unsafe methods. Hospitals regularly saw 
women in 'septic abortion wards,' where they would die of hemorrhage or 
infection after an incomplete attempt to self-abort. Seeing the danger 
of these methods, some small groups of people learned how to provide 
safe and successful abortions. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-roe-wade-abortion-jane-collective-flashback-perspec-0122-jm-20170119-story.html" rel="noreferrer">The Jane Collective</a>
 is a great example as they provided over 11,000 illegal but safe 
abortions in Chicago. Even with people organizing to provide safe 
abortion, it still wasnâ€™t enough to meet the needs of women across the
 U.S."</p>
<blockquote>"One in four white women who sought an abortion died because
 of it, compared to one in two non-white women and Puerto Rican women."</blockquote>
<p>Although <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/03/lessons-roe-will-past-be-prologue" rel="noreferrer">17 states had legal abortion, before </a><a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/03/lessons-roe-will-past-be-prologue" rel="noreferrer">Roe v. Wade</a>
 in 1973, which made it legal nationwide, for those women who didn't 
live in those states, back alley abortions, in addition to women trying 
to abort their fetus on their own was a serious problem. According to 
the Guttmacher Institute, it's estimated that between the 1950s and 
1960s, anywhere between <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/03/lessons-roe-will-past-be-prologue" rel="noreferrer">200,000 and 1.2 million illegal abortions were performed a year</a>
 â€” either in back alley situations or self-induced. One study found 
that 829,000 illegal abortions took place in North Carolina alone in 
1967. In 1965, it's estimated that illegal abortions accounted for 17 
percent of pregnancy-related deaths that year. Although, as the 
institute points out, those were just the cases that were reported. So 
it's assumed that the actual percentage is far greater. </p>
<p>There was also race and class barriers when it came to getting <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/03/lessons-roe-will-past-be-prologue" rel="noreferrer">these illegal abortions</a>.
 An example in this disparity, according to the Guttmacher Institute, 
could be found in New York City in the 1960s, where one in four white 
women who sought an abortion died because of it, compared to one in two 
non-white women and Puerto Rican women. </p>
<h2>The 1970s</h2>
<p>By the time the 1970s rolled around and before 1973, women who didn't
 live in those aforementioned 17 states, were still basically taking a 
huge risk with their lives when they sought an abortion. According to 
research by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 1972 saw 
130,000 illegal abortions, either by self-inducing or seeking help from 
someone else, which most of the time meant a back alley abortion. Out of
 these 100k+ women, 39 died. From 1972 to 1974, the Guttmacher Institute
 reports that "the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/03/lessons-roe-will-past-be-prologue" rel="noreferrer">mortality rate due to illegal abortion</a>
 for non-white women was 12 times that for white women." So although 
January 22, 1973 changed things, it didn't change everything. </p>
<figcaption>Charles McQuillan/Getty Images News/Getty Images</figcaption><p>"After
 the legalization of abortion in the U.S. in 1973, most abortions were 
provided in a physicianâ€™s office through dilatation and curettage, 
also known as D and C," says Grant. "This process involved dilating the 
opening of the cervix by introducing a sterile, narrow steel rod through
 the vagina into the cervix. Then, a doctor would insert a spoon-shaped 
instrument, called a curette, to manually remove the uterine lining from
 the uterus by gently puling it from the uterine wall.</p>
<p>"By the mid-1970s, advances in abortion technology introduced a new 
method called aspiration abortion," says Grant. "During an aspiration 
abortion, the doctor would use a small hand held suction device or 
electric suction machine to gently remove the contents of the uterus and
 end the pregnancy. The advantages of aspiration abortion over D and C 
was that it could be provided earlier in a pregnancy and the abortion 
process was quicker and less painful than using a curette." Finally, 
women could walk into clinics or doctor's offices and get the safe 
procedure they had every right to have.</p>
<p>I spoke a few women about their own abortion experiences during this 
time. And, none of them wanted to remain anonymous and believe this is 
important discussion we need to be having.</p>
<h2>1978: Jayne's Story</h2>
<p>"I had an abortion in 1978 in Los Angeles," Jayne Wallace tells 
Bustle. "I had moved there from Philadelphia, to live with a guy I 
eventually married (and divorced); I was 23.</p>
<p>I had been on birth control pills since I was 15 due to major 
menstrual pain, then decided to stop and try a more natural method. 
Started using one of the first little 'buds' you put in before sex.Â 
Well, didn't work.</p>
<blockquote>"Uncomfortable, disturbing, but I never looked back."</blockquote>
<p>As soon as I knew I was pregnant. I called my friend's sister who was
 a gyno in L.A. The bottom line â€” I wasn't married and nowhere near 
being ready to have a kid. Fortunately, I had no religious issues and 
had the funds, as well as the support of my 'boyfriend' at the time. I 
can't imagine what would have been my life if I didn't have access to 
Planned Parenthood and a clean and safe environment, so it was a happy 
ending. Uncomfortable, disturbing, but I never looked back.Â Over the 
years, as I've relayed that story to other women, I found several who 
were in the same circumstance. A child at that time would have been 
unwanted, a burden, and parented by 'a child myself.'</p>
<p>And happy to say, that guy and I had a daughterÂ five years laterÂ 
â€” she's now 34 (he's my ex), but I took her to a Planned Parenthood 
rally in LA when she was about two or three â€” in fact Frank Zappa 
spoke.</p>
<p>I find it outrageous that there [was] a pro-life 'event' at the White
 House [last week]. I have always felt that pro-lifers only care about 
fetuses but once they're born â€” no healthcare, education, etc."</p>
<h2>The 1980s</h2>
<p>"During the 1980s and early '90s, small advances in abortion 
technology were primarily in the use of newly designed instruments and 
medications to assist in dilation of the cervix and better manage pain,"
 says Grant. "These improvements were helpful but would not be 
considered major changes in the way abortion was performed. The next 
major advance in abortion technology was the introduction of <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/is-the-abortion-pill-safe-a-new-study-could-save-women-with-little-access-to-reproductive-health-care-7867142">Mifepristone as medication abortion</a>, also known as the abortion pill, which received FDA approval in the U.S. in 2000."</p>
<blockquote>"A major concern at that time for many women, was that someone would find out."</blockquote>
<p>Although medical advances were safer in the 1980s, Hauser, who worked
 at an abortion clinic in the 1980s, found that a major concern at that 
time for many women, was that someone would find out. At the time, as 
she tells Bustle, the culture climate was rife with anti-abortion 
rhetoric and violence. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/1/9827886/abortion-clinic-attacks-mapped" rel="noreferrer">Abortion clinic bombings were far too common</a>
 in the '80s and '90s. In 1984, American Family Planning of Pensacola, 
was bombed twice in the period of just six months and the Feminist 
Women's Health Center in Everett, Washington, experienced three arson 
attacks between 1983 and 1984. </p>
<p>"But a common theme that ran through almost every story regardless of
 when these women had their abortion was the positive and important 
impact abortion access has had in their lives," says Hauser.</p>
<h2>1980: Edith's Story</h2>
<p>"On Friday, February 15, 1980, [my partner] and I headed to the old 
Jewish Memorial Hospital in upper Manhattan where my doctor met us; and,
 while I was terrified of needles, I went through with the abortion," 
Edith G. Tolchin, author of <a href="http://www.fannyonfire.com/" rel="noreferrer">Fanny on Fire</a>, tells Bustle.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I felt absolutely nothing. I was asleep during the 
procedure and had no pain afterwards, though I had no idea Iâ€™d be 
bleeding as if I had my period. Of course back then we had no internet 
and, unless one went to the library beforehand â€” which I hadnâ€™t 
thought of doing â€” I had no idea of what to expect afterwards.</p>
<p>I just took a sick day from work that Friday... and I returned to 
work the following week a bit empty emotionally, but none the worse for 
the wear.</p>
<p>As I look back, it was a time before abortion center bombings, though
 I didnâ€™t pay much attention to those events back then. It just seemed
 like a no muss-no fuss procedure; a convenience. </p>
<p>I am a feminist and have always been. I was young when the stars of 
our movement, Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Sheila Michaels and Sonia 
Pressmanâ€”and all the other â€œMs. Crusadersâ€â€” set the groundwork 
for our lives. I am satisfied with my decision and I did go on to have 
two children." </p>
<h2>The '90s - Now</h2>
<p>Here we are <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-twitter-users-are-commemorating-roe-v-wades-45th-anniversary-7974932">45 years after the </a><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-twitter-users-are-commemorating-roe-v-wades-45th-anniversary-7974932">Roe v. Wade</a>
 decision, and yet here we are still fighting for control over our 
bodies. Or, as my mother so eloquently put it, "I can't believe we're 
still dealing with this BS." But jumping from the '80s to now, there has
 be progress, but there's also been a lot of backward movement, too. </p>
<p>"A major development has been the introduction of medication abortion
 in the U.S, in 2000 â€” mifepristone (â€œru-486â€ aka â€œfrench 
abortion pillâ€) â€” and also wider use of the mvaâ€”manual vacuum 
aspirator," Dr. Carole Joffe, professor at UC San Franciscoâ€™s <a href="http://ansirh.org/" rel="noreferrer">Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH)</a>,
 tells Bustle. "Both of these technologies have expanded access â€” in a
 number of states nurse practitioners are allowed to perform medication 
abortions â€” mva training has spread to family medicine and in some 
cases nurse practitioners or other advanced practice cliniciansâ€¦so the
 universe of providers has expanded, and both the mva and medication ab 
allow for earlier termination than occurred previously with vacuum 
suction abortions â€” the dominant method before 2000."</p>
<blockquote>"I would say the stigma has definitely gotten worse, as the cumulative effect of years of anti-abortion propaganda takes hold."</blockquote>
<p>But despite the advances in the abortion procedure, especially with 
mifepristone, "the abortion pill," being accessible, what all three 
experts agree on is the fact that in the stigma surrounding abortions 
still hasn't changed. "I would say the stigma has definitely gotten 
worse, as the cumulative effect of <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/110733-6-totally-false-facts-about-planned-parenthood-the-gop-will-claim-are-true-in-the-second">years of anti-abortion propaganda</a>
 takes hold," says Dr. Joffe. "In the '70s for example, abortion clinic 
directors have told me women felt incredibly lucky to have access to an 
abortion â€” remembering the disasters of the illegal period â€” and 
felt little shame. The womenâ€™s movement of the 1960s and early 1970s 
had promoted abortion as a womanâ€™s right, and pressed for legalization
 so women wouldnâ€™t be injured or die."</p>
<figcaption>Charles McQuillan/Getty Images News/Getty Images</figcaption><p>But while that stigma still exists, it hasn't stopped women from being vocal about their abortions. It's in <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-womens-abortion-stories-are-shattering-stigma-around-the-procedure-7970916">sharing our abortion stories</a>
 that we can shatter the stigma surrounding abortion. Whether we choose 
to share them anonymously or not, they need to be told and heard. "For a
 very long time, women were shamed into silence about their need for 
abortion care," says Hauser. "Social conservatives stigmatized the 
procedure and shamed women who sought abortion care in an effort to keep
 us isolated from each other and from the knowledge that the need for 
abortion care is common â€” and has been so throughout the generations. 
Fear of judgement still keeps many women from talking about their own 
abortion experiences. But there is a movement afoot. Abortion 
story-telling campaigns like Advocates for Youths'<a href="http://webmail.advocatesforyouth.org/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.1in3campaign.org/" rel="noreferrer"> 1 in 3 Campaign</a>
 are designed to help women break through the silence and shatter the 
stigma. More than 1,400 people have shared their own abortion stories 
with the Campaign to demonstrate the positive impact abortion access has
 had on their lives. And next month 100 people will share their stories 
live for the 1 in 3 Campaignâ€™s 4th Annual Six-hour Abortion Speakout: 
Justice for Jane. These efforts and others like them have helped to 
reduce the stigma many women have been made to feel. These days, when I 
share my own abortion story, I am struck by the numbers of other women 
who come up to me afterwards to share theirs â€” many for the first 
time. We are tired of the silence and fed up with the politics of 
shame." Which is most especially evidenced by the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/144138-abortion-clinics-are-closing-at-the-fastest-rate-since-the-procedure-was-legalized-in-1973">closing of abortion clinics</a> and the chipping away of access by politicians, as Hauser mentioned. </p>
<p>"From the 1970s, the numbers of freestanding abortion clinics in the 
U.S. continued to increase, but by the 1990s, clinics began to close," 
says Grant. "These closures were largely caused by targeted regulations 
by anti-abortion legislators against abortion providers, which made 
opening and running a clinic expensive and fraught with challenges. 
These regulations perpetuated stigma by drawing an imaginary line 
between abortion care and other types of medical care. They falsely 
claimed abortion was dangerous and thus placed unnecessary regulations 
and processes not required by any other type of medicine on abortion 
providers. These needless restrictions were an attempt to shut down 
clinics and create fear and shame among those who choose abortion."</p>
<p>Ultimately, the fight is far from over when it comes to women's 
reproductive rights and a woman's right to choose. So while we celebrate
 the landmark decision that was made 45 years go, we also need to keep 
ourselves educated, continue to be vocal, and fight, fight, fight. 
Because nobody, and I mean, nobody, has any right to tell a woman what 
she can and can't do with her body. </p>
