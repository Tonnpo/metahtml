<p>I’m Scaachi Koul, a culture writer for BuzzFeed News, taking over 
from your trusted How To Plague columnist Katie Notopoulos (who is on 
maternity leave!). I'm not an expert on anything but I am very bossy so 
naturally I’m here to tell you how to live during a pandemic. I’ll be 
doling out advice on the best coronavirus-related etiquette, how to 
handle moral quandaries, and little squabbles, sometimes with actual 
expert input.</p>
<p>I live in a housing complex in Venice, California with four other 
women that I do not know very well/at all that live in the three front 
housing units and I live in the back. I've asked them to not use my 
furniture (in general) or stand by my front door to talk on the phone in
 order to respect social distancing. One of them called me tightly wound
 and attempted to argue my patio furniture is communal. I notice that my
 neighbors also do not wear face masks when using the common area in the
 front or even when going on walks. What is proper etiquette for people 
that live in complexes where there are communal areas, entrances, etc.? 
Please help, I feel like a bitch, but it's a #pandemic so… —Kelly</p>
<p>If you really don’t want your neighbors to use furniture that you’ve 
left in what sounds like a common area, then don’t leave your furniture 
in a common area. It’s not like they’re sipping on a drink you left 
behind while you went to the restroom; they’re sitting on a seat in a 
courtyard that belongs to all of you.</p>
<p>If your neighbors are entering your sectioned-off outdoor property, 
that indeed sucks and merits a larger conversation with them about 
trespassing. But it sounds like you’ve left a chair and table out and 
they’re using it when you’re not outside and you can’t really stop 
someone from using a communal space, even if they’re doing so without 
care or concern for everyone else. Do you want to be the lady who brings
 her patio furniture in after using it?</p>
<p>Have you tried talking to them about using masks when they’re in the 
common areas? Are there some other rules you can put in place that’ll 
make you feel better? Would you be comforted if they wiped down the 
furniture they use with Lysol wipes? Sometimes you have to make it real 
easy for people, like leaving sanitizers out for everyone to use. It is a
 burden to be right.</p>
<p>I would also suggest talking to a landlord or property manager who 
might be able to put down some ground rules for the tenants so it 
doesn’t all fall on you. If you don’t feel like doing any of this, there
 are passive-aggressive ways to handle the situation. Dump water on the 
chairs so they’re dripping wet at all times. Put gum on the seats. If 
they take a call near your door and you can hear it, start screaming. 
Just start screaming. You can’t force people to behave the way you might
 want them to during a pandemic, but you can be annoying enough to get 
them to leave you the fuck alone. So I guess the real question is: Is 
the relationship you have with your neighbors important, or are you 
ready to just lose your goddamn mind already and start screaming???</p>
<p>Can you please give me some suggestions for what to do on online 
dates during the lockdown? I matched with a guy on Bumble and so far 
we’ve watched movies and played online card games “together,” but any 
other tips would be appreciated!—Ellie</p>
<p>Listen, I’m not a doer. I don’t like going places or having fun. For 
people like me, this quarantine is a unique hell, because video calls 
can’t really replicate the thing I enjoy doing the most with the people I
 like: sitting around and drinking and falling into comfortable silences
 that no one really questions. Remote hangs require activity, so I 
appreciate how challenging this situation is.</p>
<p>And since I don’t like to do anything and I especially hate meeting 
new people, I called my friend Barb for some advice. Barb dates a lot, 
is a great deal of fun, and when I FaceTimed her to ask for suggestions 
for you, she answered the phone wearing nothing but her bra and 
balancing a bowl of granola, yogurt, raspberries, and something called 
“pecan butter” between her boobs. That’s who Barb is. She does yoga and 
takes long walks and aligns her chakras daily. She is enjoying life on a
 level that I can’t even conceive of, and it makes me mad.</p>
<p>Here’s what she suggested: “They could both make the same recipe. 
Choose a cookbook and have dinner together. There’s also that game I 
bought, We’re Not Really Strangers. If you’re in a stage where you want 
to go from having weird online dates to creating some level of 
connection, it can be really good.” <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com/collections/games/products/not-really-strangers-card-deck">We’re Not Really Strangers</a> is kind of like Cards Against Humanity, but instead of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rachelzarrell/theres-one-cards-against-humanity-card-the-creator-regrets-m">shitty anti-trans jokes and gags about date rape</a>, it allows you both to have a deeper (to Barb) and more stressful (to me) conversation.</p>
<p>There’s also the Houseparty app, which lets you and your date play 
some games together online if you’re looking for something to do other 
than make unbroken eye contact for three hours, which again is Barb’s 
dream and my nightmare. (If you want my advice, I’d say that if you want
 to know what a person’s really like, play Pictionary with them. No one 
can hide when you play Pictionary.)</p>
<p>You’re at the beginning of a relationship, where everything is new 
and fun and the person you’re dating is still kind of a mystery so it’s 
an ideal time to just enjoy talking to them.</p>
<p>“It’s just nice to slow things down and have somebody write to you 
and be forced to be a little bit more consistent and have the space and 
distance to see if you really like someone or if you’re just going 
through the motions,” Barb said. It’s not bad advice, even if the woman 
giving it is an açai smoothie bowl come to life.</p>
<p>Hi. I have a question about wearing a face mask and being 
claustrophobic. I feel like I'm being smothered literally! I don't 
breathe right, I get VERY anxious, and just can NOT tolerate anything 
covering my face. I know I'm not alone on this. What do I do? What are 
MY rights? —Debbie</p>
<p>Discomfort and real anxiety are different things, so I’m going to 
assume that this goes beyond the vague discomfort of, say, wearing a 
shirt with a tag that keeps poking you. Claustrophobia triggered from 
the masks we’re now being conditioned to wear is a real thing — have you
 tried wearing one with your glasses??? HELL! — but there are ways to 
combat it.</p>
<p>Personally, I have a number of phobias (not to brag), but I haven’t 
even begun to deal with any of them, so I consulted Tom Bunn, a licensed
 therapist, retired airline pilot, and author of Panic Free: The 10-Day 
Program to End Panic, Anxiety, and Claustrophobia, who has some 
suggestions on how to deal with a stuffy face mask.</p>
<p>He explained that when you start to panic, it’s your sympathetic 
nervous system revving you up. This increases your heart rate, your 
breathing rate, your perspiration, and gives you all the signals that 
you are Not Enjoying This. Your parasympathetic nervous system, however,
 is the thing that calms that stress down. “Babies can’t calm 
themselves. They need someone else to do it for them. What research 
shows is that three things activate a baby’s parasympathetic nervous 
system,” Bunn said. “A face that’s benevolent, touch, and voice quality.
 That’s what mom does. Mom’s face, her voice, and her touch activates 
the calming system.”</p>
<p>But, look, you’re an adult, and thinking of your mom might not calm 
you down so much as make you worry about whatever needlessly judgmental 
comment she’s going to make about your upper arms, AS IF I NEED THIS 
RIGHT NOW, MONA. You can practice this using someone else who maybe 
didn’t once make you cry when you tried on a bathing suit in front of 
her in the third grade.</p>
<p>“Think of a moment with a totally accepting person. A buddy, 
nonjudgmental, not critical,” Bunn said. “The next thing is to take the 
feelings she has when she starts thinking of putting on a mask and link 
them to being with her friend. She could imagine she’s with her friend 
and she’s holding the mask there, thinking about putting it on. Then she
 wants to talk to her friend, putting the mask on. Then the next step is
 to put it on temporarily and take it off. It’s not just to desensitize 
it, but to link it to her friend.”</p>
<p>This will probably not cure your claustrophobia overnight. But 
associating the mask with a trusted friend might work better than 
thinking it’s a harbinger of doom. Something else that might help is 
connecting wearing the mask to positive activities like walking to a 
street or a park you like, or visiting a friend on their stoop (6 feet 
away, please!) while wearing it. If the mask has become a symbol of 
stressful errands you have to do — Costco runs with people standing too 
close to you, long lines at the pharmacy where everyone seems to have a 
cold — it’s not surprising that you’ve begun to feel strangled by this 
little piece of cloth.</p>
<p>As for your final question — “What are MY rights?” — your rights are 
manifold. In some states, you still have the right, for now, to go 
outside without wearing a mask. But what you do have at all times and in
 all places is the privilege of doing something that could stop someone 
else from getting sick, since you likely don’t know if you have the 
coronavirus. And if that’s not enough, you can stop yourself from 
getting sick, thereby saving your friends and family from having to 
worry about you. You have an obligation to everyone else around you, 
some of whom have weaker immune systems, are at a greater risk of 
getting sick, and maybe don’t have access to any PPE themselves, to try 
to do your part to keep them from getting ill.</p>
<p>That, Debbie, is your right. It’s a pretty good one to have. ●</p>
