<figcaption class="rm-manual">For the first time this year, Cyber 
Command is using it's premier annual exercise to reevaluate some of its 
cyber teams. (Aiyana Paschal/U.S Cyber Command) </figcaption><p class="">WASHINGTON
 — U.S. Cyber Command is using its annual training exercise this week to
 codify best practices for defensive cyber teams.</p>
<p>Cyber Flag, the command’s premier annual training event, is happening
 on the heels of Cyber Command’s budget request that proposes <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/cyber/2021/06/14/air-force-would-contribute-bulk-of-new-cyber-mission-force-teams/">adding more teams and potentially altering their composition</a> to adapt to a rapidly changing threat landscape.</p>
<p>For the first time, the exercise will help identify characteristics of successful <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/cyber/2021/01/29/hand-to-hand-combat-on-computer-networks-how-cyber-threat-hunters-work/">cyber protection teams</a>, which conduct defensive cyberspace operations.</p>
<p>This year’s exercise, Cyber Flag 21-2, includes over 430 individuals 
from 17 teams from the U.S., UK, Canada, National Guard, House of 
Representatives and U.S. Postal Service and is taking place across eight
 time zones. The event uses the Persistent Cyber Training Environment — 
an online client that allows Cyber Command warriors to log on from 
anywhere for training and mission rehearsal.</p>
<p>The exercise was set in the Pacific region at a fictitious allied 
logistics support depot where teams had to contend with attacks from two
 adversaries: One was more advanced and focused on denial and 
disruption, while the other was less sophisticated and focused on theft 
of intellectual property and personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>In the past, Cyber Command used the exercise to <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/home/2017/07/03/cyber-flag-exclusive-what-goes-into-validating-a-cyber-team/">validate teams</a>, but as the threat has evolved, leaders wanted to test concepts and codify new team structures to optimize success.</p>
<p>“We’re continuously evaluating the proficiency of our force. We’re 
evaluating where the gaps are. We’re evaluating the new TTPs [tactics, 
techniques and procedures] that the adversary presents,” Coast Guard 
Rear Adm. Christopher Bartz, chief of exercises and training at Cyber 
Command, told reporters June 22. “We are evolving our training at the 
speed that the adversary is evolving their TTPs.”</p>
<p>The exercise will allow Cyber Command, which sets <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/cyber/2021/05/05/air-force-cyber-school-will-add-online-training-tool/">general standards</a> across all the services for <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/dod/2020/01/10/pentagon-gets-big-win-on-cyber-forces/">cyber teams’ training</a> and the <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/dod/2017/09/07/cyber-command-moves-toward-standardized-cyber-kits/">equipment they use</a>, to extract best practices and spread those through the cyberspace community, officials explained.</p>
<p>Bartz equated the effort to other constructs within the military, 
such as aviation stand teams that go to various units and communicate 
best practices through the broader aviation community.</p>
<p>With broader domestic participation, officials said they can observe 
how others conduct defensive cyber operations, contributing to a more 
holistic governmentwide approach for national security and defense.</p>
<p>Also for the first time this year, teams competed against each other 
with an overall winner to be selected at the conclusion of the exercise 
June 25. Assessors will observe how teams identify threats and the 
techniques defenders use to eject threats from the network or deny 
further compromise.</p>
<p>In written testimony to Congress this year, Gen. Paul Nakasone, 
commander of Cyber Command, outlined one of the command’s top 
priorities: realigning cyber protection teams.</p>
<p>“USCYBERCOM is working with the combatant commands to ensure they 
have dependable defensive support for their missions while we retain 
forces to deal with global challenges to the DoDIN [Department of 
Defense Information Network],” he wrote.</p>
<p>Expanded scope</p>
<p>Cyber Command’s expanded use of <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/cyber/2021/01/28/latest-version-of-cyber-training-to-roll-out-in-coming-months/">PCTE</a> allowed the exercise to grow significantly. The range itself was five times larger than last year, <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/dod/cybercom/2020/06/15/for-the-first-time-cyber-commands-major-exercise-will-use-new-training-platform/">the first year Cyber Command used the platform for its largest exercise</a>.</p>
<p>The PCTE team even established a custom help desk for Cyber Flag — 
capable of assisting with everything from forgotten passwords to major 
engineering fixes.</p>
<p>The team applies lessons from the exercise to future events and 
versions of the platform. For example, the team improved the chat 
function in the platform after users found it hard to use last year, and
 they’re awaiting feedback.</p>
<p>The platform and program team have grown to be able to support 
thousands of activities daily, even last week supporting two major 
exercises simultaneously: Cyber Flag and <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/cyber/2021/06/23/guardsmen-train-for-real-world-cyber-disruptions/">Cyber Yankee</a>, a National Guard-focused exercise that took place in New England.</p>
<p>The platform supported the cyber operations kit for UK operators 
during Cyber Flag, making their experience more realistic. “We want the 
experience of our foreign allies to be just as valuable and meaningful 
as any other CMF [cyber mission force] user on PCTE,” said W. Cory 
Bogler, lead PCTE operations engineer for Product Manager Cyber 
Resiliency &amp; Training in the Army Program Executive Office 
Simulation, Training and Instrumentation.</p>
<p>Officials from the PCTE team said the next Cyber Flag — Cyber Flag 
21-3 in October — will include participation from all the Five Eyes 
intelligence alliance nations: the U.S., UK, Canada, <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/cyber/2020/12/04/dod-and-australia-ink-first-ever-cyber-training-partnership/">Australia</a> and New Zealand.</p>
