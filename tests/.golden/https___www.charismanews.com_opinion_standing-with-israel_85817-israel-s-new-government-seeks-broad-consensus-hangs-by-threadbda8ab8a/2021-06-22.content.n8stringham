 finally has a new government in place, ending Benjamin Netanyahu's 
historic 12-year run as prime minister. But the protracted political 
impasse of recent years is far from over, as the extremely broad 
coalition may prove unworkable and is hanging on by the thinnest of 
margins. </p>
<p> Over the past 30 months, the Israeli public has stumbled through 
four frustrating national elections in a political deadlock that has 
become mystifying. The latest ballot on March 23 was closer than ever, 
and it took 12 weeks for the forces of "change" to finally oust 
Netanyahu. The new government, <a href="https://www.charismanews.com/opinion/standing-with-israel/85741-naftali-bennett-becomes-israel-s-new-prime-minister">led for now by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett</a>, was approved in mid-June by the ultra-slim margin of 60 to 59 (with one abstention) and remains in constant peril of collapse.</p>
<p> The new ruling coalition is a loose collection of eight very diverse
 parties from the right, center, left and Arab sector who are primarily 
held together by their common desire to keep Netanyahu from returning as
 prime minister. It took four tries to pry him out of office, and even 
then it was by a single vote in the Knesset. The outcome was in such 
doubt that one lawmaker was in a serious car crash in the Galilee that 
morning and still rushed to Jerusalem to vote, while another 
parliamentarian was on a stretcher receiving medical treatments in the 
Knesset chamber so she could be there to vote.</p>
<p> Netanyahu managed an unprecedented run as prime minister because of 
his diplomatic and economic acumen, his mastery of Israeli politics, and
 above all his reputation as "Mr. Security." Most Israelis came to trust
 him to keep them safe, and for the most part he did. After facing 
several rocket wars with Hamas in the early 2010s, Netanyahu has 
overseen a relatively peaceful period for Israel, with the fewest ever 
number of deaths from the conflict and terror attacks in recent years. 
He kept the brutal Syrian civil war from spilling over into Israel even 
while successfully striking at Iranian and Hizbullah targets deep inside
 the country. He oversaw a series of clandestine operations that 
effectively set back Iran's nuclear program by years. And he steered 
Israel past the coronavirus threat faster and more effectively than any 
other national leader worldwide.</p>
<p> But the scandals surrounding Netanyahu weakened his support on the 
right, and now a new generation of leaders is taking the reins of power.
 They are generally younger, forward-looking and concerned about the 
well-being of the entire nation.</p>
<p> The incoming coalition was forged around a rotation agreement 
between Bennett and Yair Lapid, who will serve as foreign minister and 
alternate prime minister until he takes over the top job in August 2023.
 Both leaders have retained veto power over major government decisions.</p>
<p> Head of the right-wing Yamina party, Bennett is a former commander 
of elite IDF units and a successful hi-tech entrepreneur. Born into a 
secular family, he became religiously observant and more conservative in
 his views, even heading the Yesha settlements council for a while. He 
is Israel's first premier to regularly wear a kippa.</p>
<p> As leader of the centrist Yesh Atid faction, Lapid is a former TV 
talk show host who entered politics a decade ago to represent young, 
secular Israelis who resent the inordinate power and favoritism enjoyed 
by the ultra-Orthodox community. To his left, Merav Michaeli (Labour) 
and Nitzan Horowitz (Meretz) also were TV news personalities who have 
made use of digital and social media to build a younger following.</p>
<p> They are joined in the coalition by former Israel Defense Forces 
Gen. Benny Gantz of Blue and White, Russian strongman Avigdor Liberman 
of Yisrael Beiteinu, former Likudnik Gideon Sa'ar of New Hope and —the 
unlikeliest of partners—Mansour Abbas of the Arab-Islamist faction 
Ra'am.</p>
<p> The common denominator between them is a sense that Netanyahu based 
so many important decisions in recent years not on national interests, 
but on simply staying in power to gain an advantage—and even immunity—in
 his ongoing corruption trials. He also has sided with the 
ultra-Orthodox on many issues, such as reneging on the Western Wall 
prayer compromise, thereby alienating many Israelis as well as much of 
Diaspora Jewry.</p>
<p> Bennett will focus on getting back to good governance, passing a 
proper state budget, making decisions by consensus, dealing with 
societal tensions and taking all sectors of the populace into 
consideration.</p>
<p> Meanwhile, Lapid will handle foreign policy. Few expect much 
movement toward a "two-state solution" with the Palestinians, as it 
could unravel the fragile coalition. Rather, Lapid's main efforts will 
be on building ties with the Biden administration and European Union, 
and repairing the breach with the progressive left, beginning with 
American Jewish leaders. The Bennett-Lapid government also will try to 
continue the momentum of the Abraham Accords towards normalization with 
the Arab world.</p>
<p> No doubt those regional accords influenced Ra'am to become the first
 Arab party to sit as full-fledged members of an Israeli Cabinet. 
Netanyahu legitimized such a move by first reaching out to Mansour Abbas
 ahead of the last election, but he eventually chose to go with the 
"change" movement, putting the Bennett-Lapid alignment over the top by 
one seat. Abbas appears to be taking a genuinely pragmatic and 
conciliatory approach towards the Jewish majority in Israel, even 
visiting a synagogue in Lod burned by Arab rioters during the recent 
Gaza conflict and pledging to rebuild it. </p>
<p> This has now put Netanyahu and the Likud in the unfamiliar position 
of sitting in the opposition, and they are vowing to bring down the 
Bennett-Lapid coalition as soon as possible. The Knesset plenum meets to
 vote every Monday thru Wednesday, and no doubt Likud will be filing 
weekly no-confidence motions against the government. This means 
lawmakers on both sides will not be traveling abroad much over coming 
months, as the thinnest of margins separates Israel from yet another 
election. </p>
