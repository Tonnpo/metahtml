<p>Finding dog-friendly parks isn’t that easy in this town where dogs 
are banned from many public spaces. So as Ms. Tiggie-Winkle’s mum 
(@mstiggiewinklexx if you want to follow her antics!), here are a few 
places I found where she is always welcome and where we can both have a 
good time.</p>
<p>1. Pawtel</p>
<p>Pawtel is a great spot to let your pet run around just out of the 
city in Mae Rim, and it’s safe and secure. As the name suggests, this is
 a dog lovers’ hotel and it also has an onsite café where dogs and 
owners can hang out, relax, enjoy a cup of coffee or a good boi bone. 
There is even a doggy pool to frolic in on a hot steamy May day. <a href="https://www.pawtelchiangmai.com/" rel="noopener">www.pawtelchiangmai.com</a></p>
<p>2. Ketawa Pet Friendly Hotel and Cafe</p>
<p>Situated in the tranquil area of Wat Ket, Ketawa Pet Friendly Hotel 
and Cafe welcomes both humans and their four-footed buddies. This is a 
casual and fun place designed to meet the needs of humans and dogs. The 
café prepares both Thai and European dishes with all day dining. Ketawa 
also has all that is required for pets ranging from snacks, wet and dry 
food, toys, bowls, and sanitary accessories. You can also buy some fun 
toys to take home so the fun can continue.</p>

<p>3. Rosario Oasis Resort</p>
<p>We all need to get away on a break once in a while…and our beloved 
pets could probably do with a break too! A serious of 
colonial-style-inspired buildings are interspersed amidst a lovely 
garden overlooking lush green paddy fields and the moutnains beyond in 
this dog-friendly resort for the whole family. SErving mouthwatering 
dishes decorated beautifully with edible flowers, freshly baked goodies,
 aromatic tea and coffee, the venue has all sorts of fun and fabulous 
activities that guests can enjoy all day long. The kids can have fun 
with on the playground while dogs and cats are allowed to wander the 
grounds. Take the entire family, plus pooches, and enjoy an indulgent 
holiday together.</p>

<p>4. Kaomai Lanna Hotel and Resort</p>
<p>Awarded by UNESCO for New Design in Heritage Context in 2018, Kaomai 
Lanna resort is surrounded by a large tropical garden on the way towards
 Chom Thong. The venue features unique accommodation renovated from the 
former tobacco curing barns and furnished with colonial style antique 
furniture</p>
<p>where dogs are welcomed to stay with their owners. Café Rongbom is 
also set on site with a large evergreen area, where you can sit back and
 enjoy your favourite cup of coffee and let your dogs romp around. It’s 
definitely a wonderful destination for you and your buddies to chill out
 in laid-back surroundings.</p>

<p>5. Kao Makham Café</p>
<p>Hosted by Parinda Garden Resort in Chom Thong district, Kao Makham 
Café is in a tree house in a large tamarind tree. It is an idyllic venue
 away from the hustle ‘n’ bustle of the city and a perfect spot to bring
 along your four-legged companion. You can sit up in a round-house, 
enjoying the spectacular panoramic views of the peaceful countryside and
 energising your soul with a cup of coffee. Kao Makham Cafe is 
surrounded by beautifully landscaped garden area with cute mini camping 
style corners filled with flower plots where pets are welcome to run 
around freely.</p>

<p>6. No.39 Café</p>
<p>Tucked away in Soi Wat Umong, No.39 café enthralls visitors with its 
greenery and shady atmosphere. There are many different seating areas to
 sit back in. You can sit inside the glass house, in an old wooden 
cottage or lie down under shady trees overlooking the small pond. The 
outdoor space also opens up to your beloved four-legged buds to explore.
 There is no boundary between land and pond, be sure to keep a close eye
 on your beloved pet. No.39 serves up hot and cold coffees, teas, 
smoothies, as well as homemade baked products. Easy and quick dishes 
such as breakfast set, hamburgers, French fries are available.</p>

<p>7. 123glamp</p>
<p>If you love the idea of going camping, but just don’t enjoy spending a
 night away from home and leaving your best bud at home, 123glamp is 
highly recommended. Nestled in San Phi Suea area, 123glamp is an outdoor
 glamping style café on a large green lawn by the river. The café has 
all that campers and glampers need so you don’t need to bring any 
camping essentials. You can relax in a tent beneath the shady trees or 
sit on folding chairs by the river and enjoy aromatic drip coffee and 
let your dog run around. Overnight private campgrounds can be booked in 
advanced for parties and of course pets are welcome to stay.</p>
