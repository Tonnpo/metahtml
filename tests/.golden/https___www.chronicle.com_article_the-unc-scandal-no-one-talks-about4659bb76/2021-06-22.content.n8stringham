<p class="rm-manual"> June 22, 2021 </p>
<p>In the summer of 2012, the biggest scandal in half a century was 
splintering the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A series of
 phantom courses — supposedly lecture classes, but they never met in 
person — <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/widespread-nature-of-chapel-hills-academic-fraud-is-laid-bare/">had been used for years</a> by athletes trying to stay eligible to play. At a university that <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/u-of-north-carolina-is-proud-of-its-balance-of-big-time-athletics-and-quality-academics/">had long bragged about winning “the right way,”</a> the revelation was evidence of an irresistible hypocrisy. Journalists and faculty members agitated for answers.</p>
<p>In the midst of the controversy, a bizarre subplot developed: Five 
thousand miles away, a physics professor named Paul Frampton sat in a 
decrepit Argentine jail. The UNC scholar had been caught at the Buenos 
Aires airport <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/magazine/the-professor-the-bikini-model-and-the-suitcase-full-of-trouble.html">with two kilograms of cocaine in his suitcase</a>. He claimed innocence, saying he’d been tricked.</p>
<p>The story made waves back in North Carolina, even as the athletics 
scandal raged. The UNC administration took Frampton off the payroll as 
he awaited trial. That move didn’t sit well with some professors. (He 
was later <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article167404762.html">awarded back pay.</a>) “It makes the faculty worried,” one scholar <a href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2012/08/frampton-supporters-ramp-up-efforts">told the student newspaper</a>.
 “What if I was in that situation? Would I be treated the same way?” Two
 faculty members set up a website to raise money for Frampton, and 
dozens of academics — at UNC and elsewhere — wrote a public letter 
objecting to the suspension.</p>
<p>Reginald Hildebrand watched the saga with disappointment. As the 
athletics scandal continued to churn, skeptical observers had — in the 
absence of a motive or more detail about the suspect classes — turned 
their gaze on the department in which they had been offered: African and
 Afro-American studies.</p>
<p>The most thorough investigation of the classes would later conclude 
that knowledge of them inside the department had been limited to a 
secretary, the department chair, and perhaps one or two others. But back
 in 2012, a laser beam of suspicion settled on Hildebrand and the 
roughly two dozen other professors in the department, which <a href="https://alumni.unc.edu/news/afam-reforms-promised-starts-with-new-name/">has since been renamed</a>.
 Whiffs of impropriety gave people the opening they needed to say 
exactly what they thought about Black studies. Letters flowed into the 
local newspapers, casting aspersions on the department’s integrity. 
“‘Black studies’ are nothing more than a politically correct sop by our 
institutions of higher learning to a preferred minority group,” one 
resident wrote in a letter to The News &amp; Observer, in Raleigh.</p>
<p>One student suggested to The Daily Tar Heel — the student newspaper, 
which I edited at the time and which published its fair share of 
sensationalistic coverage — that the entire department should be 
eliminated. “The actions of a single department have brought shame and 
embarrassment onto the entire UNC community,” he wrote. A member of the 
Board of Governors, which oversees the university system, floated the 
idea of shutting down the department.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>A lack of evidence about widespread wrongdoing in the department 
didn’t stop the generalizations and accusations. Where, Hildebrand 
wondered, was the faculty support? Why did professors across the 
university seem more willing to support a white physics professor 
ensnared in an apparent narcotics scheme than their colleagues in 
African and Afro-American studies?</p>
<p>The department was brought into being by student activists in the 
late 1960s who demanded, along with peers across the country, that Black
 scholarship be given a home at the university. In the ensuing decades, 
advocates fought tooth and nail for each new faculty position, endured 
criticism from outsiders who thought it wasn’t a serious discipline, and
 waited in vain for the program to be granted departmental status.</p>
<p>Finally, in the 1990s, African and Afro-American studies was elevated
 to a department. Julius Nyang’oro — the chair who later resigned amid 
the fake-classes scandal — wrote in his request for departmental status 
that the subservient status of African American studies made it seem 
like “some lesser academic entity to be politicized whenever there is 
inside or outside focus on the African American population at the 
university.”</p>
<p>Now the unit was taking fire. The problem wasn’t the department, <a href="http://media2.newsobserver.com/content/media/2017/1/18/anatomy.pdf">Hildebrand wrote</a>
 to The News &amp; Observer. It was that the university was attempting 
to run a minor-league sports franchise while asking the players to 
double as full-time students. “We are forced to confront the fact,” 
Hildebrand said, “that this charade can only be kept going through the 
resourceful manipulation of smoke and mirrors and by a lot of winking 
and nodding. The system will find, or create, enough academic wiggle 
room and gimmicks to keep things moving along.” The departmental 
secretary, Debby Crowder, had supplied that wiggle room, Hildebrand 
suggested, but just because the locus of the latest revelations centered
 on the department where she worked didn’t mean that the department was 
rotten.</p>
<p>The silence of fellow faculty members was particularly upsetting. 
“Such silence reads loudly as consent,” wrote one professor in the 
department, “in the face of the ongoing firestorm whose flames would 
consume us.” Hildebrand and his colleagues defended their department’s 
integrity. At a meeting in the fall of 2012, the UNC faculty endorsed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191201184405/http://faccoun.unc.edu/files/2011/03/Res2012-9OnAfAmStudies.pdf">a resolution</a>
 that “affirms the integrity and validity of the intellectual 
disciplines represented in the department of African and Afro-American 
studies and expresses our solidarity with those members of the faculty 
of that department whose professional lives and work have been in no way
 connected with academic irregularities.”</p>
<p>The faculty’s show of support came to rankle Hildebrand. Expressing 
solidarity with only the faculty members who were “in no way connected 
with academic irregularities” implied that the suspicion that clouded 
the department was legitimate. “They aren’t saying, ‘Until you prove 
he’s done something, he’s a member of this community and needs to be 
respected as such,’” Hildebrand said in <a href="https://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/sohp/id/27514">an expansive oral-history interview</a>.
 (He declined to be interviewed for my book, from which this essay is 
adapted.) And the first part of the statement, the validation of the 
department’s integrity, implied that the department needed validating. 
The well-intentioned statement of solidarity both honored and demeaned 
Hildebrand and his colleagues.</p>

<figcaption>The U. of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Unsung Founders 
Memorial, dedicated in 2005, was a stone’s throw away from Silent Sam, a
 Confederate statue that protesters tore down in 2018.</figcaption><p>It
 reminded Hildebrand of a monument the university had erected a few 
years before, to memorialize the enslaved people who had built much of 
the university’s campus. But the form it took — a low, black table 
propped up by a mass of muscular statuettes inches off the ground — 
struck some as far from an honor. When it rained, the “unsung founders” 
got splattered with mud, Hildebrand remembered. They were used as 
footrests. It was hard to even see them. “Suppose we were trying to 
honor the chancellors of this university,” Hildebrand said, “and got 
little images of all of them, and put them as table legs, and had us put
 our feet up on them. It would be so outrageous and unacceptable. … 
Nobody would even consider it.” Like the faculty’s statement in support 
of his department, the monument was both gratifying and insulting.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>The conditions that prevailed in both cases amounted to something 
“that still looks and feels and tastes like racism,” Hildebrand said.</p>
<p>Taylor Branch, the civil-rights historian and UNC alumnus, argued in his 2011 cover story for The Atlantic, “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/10/the-shame-of-college-sports/308643/">The Shame of College Sports</a>,”
 that big-time sports had begun to carry “an unmistakable whiff of the 
plantation.” The saga that played out on Branch’s own campus carried 
more than one such whiff. The African and Afro-American studies 
department’s building stood in the shadow of a statue of a Confederate 
soldier, erected at the height of the South’s white-supremacist terror 
campaign, in the early 20th century, and that statue towered over the 
Unsung Founders Memorial. (Protesters <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/package/the-rise-and-fall-of-silent-sam/">tore down the Confederate statue</a>, known as Silent Sam, in 2018.)</p>
<p>The many Black athletes who used the phantom courses to stay eligible
 lacked the right to earn money of their own. In being pushed by 
advisers to take the courses, they were being deprived of an education 
on par with their classmates. Even when the football players took the 
field, they did so amid the legacy of a white-supremacist history. <a href="https://alumni.unc.edu/news/unc-to-remove-kenan-sr-name-from-stadium-plaque/">Until 2018</a>,
 Kenan Stadium was named for William Rand Kenan Sr., the donor’s father,
 who in 1898 captained a squad of machine-gunners that carried out <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/wilmington-massacre/536457/">a</a><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/wilmington-massacre/536457/"> coup d’état against Wilmington’s biracial government</a>. Historians estimate that at least dozens and possibly hundreds of people were killed in the rebellion, many of them Black.</p>

<figcaption>The Old Well sits in front of the South Building on the Chapel Hill campus.</figcaption><p>Just
 think of it: Mostly Black players competing in a stadium built to honor
 a white-supremacist killer, deprived both of the right to be 
compensated at a market rate and of the right to a full university 
education. Black professors who worked in the shadow of a Confederate 
statue were shrouded in unfair suspicion. “This would not have taken the
 bounce it did if, somehow, in the background, we weren’t talking about 
what people perceive to be a Black department, a Black subject, and 
Black athletes,” Hildebrand said.</p>
<p>The department’s reputation was unjustly stained. In the wake of the 
scandal, Hildebrand was approached after class one day by a student who 
asked whether he thought she should mention in her graduate-school 
application that she had majored in his department. “She felt, just by 
saying that, it would be a signal that she wasn’t a serious student. 
That she’d learned nothing in my class.” That was the worst shame of 
all, the professor said — what the scandal had done to the department’s 
students. “I felt like somebody kicked me in my stomach,” he recalled.</p>
<p>Hildebrand also paid a personal price. As the scandal raged, he 
attended an event in honor of the Emancipation Proclamation, a copy of 
which was then on display at the North Carolina History Museum, in 
Raleigh. He had heard stories about how his last name came from a 
distant relative who, on emancipation, refused to take the name of the 
man who had enslaved him, instead choosing Hildebrand. At the event, 
while Hildebrand was making small talk with a former state politician, 
she asked him what he did for a living.</p>
<p>When he told her he taught Afro-American studies at UNC, she laughed in his face.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>The recent decision <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/what-the-hell-happened">not to award Nikole Hannah-Jones tenure</a> has brought public reminders of other episodes: the <a href="https://indyweek.com/news/orange/nikole-hannah-jones-unc-chapel-hill-black-women-professors/">denial of tenure to Sonja Haynes Stone</a>, a Black female professor of African American studies, in 1979; <a href="https://www.theassemblync.com/short-form/say-his-name-james-cates/">the killing of a Black town resident named James Cates</a>
 on the campus, in 1970; the university’s refusal to remove Silent Sam 
just a few years ago; and then the system’s decision, later thrown out 
by a state judge, to <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/uncs-silent-sam-settlement-sparked-a-backlash-now-a-judge-has-overturned-the-deal/">give Silent Sam to the Sons of Confederate Veterans</a>, and to pay the group $2.5 million.</p>
<p>The public scapegoating of the African and Afro-American studies 
department has not entered into this conversation — perhaps because the 
department is still viewed as complicit in the scandal. If so, that 
mistake must be corrected. Though Crowder and Nyang’oro were found to 
have presided over the infamous phantom courses, the root cause of the 
scandal was the contortions that so-called amateurism in big-time sports
 inflicts on campuses like UNC.</p>
<p>The collateral damage suffered by the department’s scholars was among
 the most lasting and shameful consequences of the scandal. It also 
revealed the extent to which Black scholarship still was not valued 
nearly half a century after the creation of the department. Had the 
irregular classes been found in Frampton’s physics department, would 
letter writers and board members have called for its elimination? Would 
newspapers have allowed public conversation to center on the 
discipline’s validity? Of course not.</p>
<p>Any institution’s priorities can be ascertained by whom it chooses to
 side with when the ship starts taking on water. Black scholars under 
siege or the shiny athletic brand? Black student activists or a 
Confederate statue? A qualified Black journalist seeking tenure or those
 who despise her work? It is no wonder that the <a href="http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2021/06/17/chapel-hill-student-body-president-its-past-time-for-a-genuine-reckoning-at-unc/">student</a><a href="http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2021/06/17/chapel-hill-student-body-president-its-past-time-for-a-genuine-reckoning-at-unc/">-</a><a href="http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2021/06/17/chapel-hill-student-body-president-its-past-time-for-a-genuine-reckoning-at-unc/">body president has urged</a> Black students and professors to stay away from Chapel Hill.</p>
