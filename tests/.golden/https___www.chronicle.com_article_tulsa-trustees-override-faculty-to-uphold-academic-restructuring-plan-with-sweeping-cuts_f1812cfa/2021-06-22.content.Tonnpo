<h1 class="rm-manual"> Tulsa Trustees Override Faculty to Uphold Academic-Restructuring Plan With Sweeping Cuts </h1>

<figcaption>Administrators at the U. of Tulsa have come under heavy fire
 for the university’s plan to cut 40 percent of its academic 
programming, primarily in the liberal arts.</figcaption><p>The 
University of Tulsa’s Board of Trustees voted on Thursday to deal what 
some see as a fatal blow to a faculty group’s last-ditch effort to limit
 the effect of the Oklahoma university’s controversial <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/U-of-Tulsa-Faculty-to-Ask/246997">academic-restructuring plan</a>.</p>
<blockquote>Tulsa administrators championed the plan as a bold, 
necessary step toward a future they see as increasingly STEM-focused and
 financially fickle.</blockquote>
<p>The board’s decision effectively reaffirmed the “True Commitment,” a 
plan that has drawn fire from faculty members and students, partly 
because it will slash 40 percent of academic programming, and also 
because of the heavy-handed tactics students and faculty members say 
have been used to quell criticism.</p>
<p>“Simply put, the board remains resolute in its opinion the 
recommendations in the Strategic Plan and True Commitment remain our 
best path forward,” Gerard P. Clancy, Tulsa’s president, wrote in a 
campuswide email. “While we welcome suggestions for improvement through 
established pathways, there will be no ‘repeal’ or ‘rollback’ of True 
Commitment.”</p>
<p>Tulsa administrators have championed the plan, which was announced in
 April, as a bold, necessary step toward a future they see as 
increasingly STEM-focused and financially fickle. But many faculty 
members, particularly those in the arts and humanities, have criticized 
it and accused the university of repeatedly violating shared-governance 
principles in creating it.</p>
<p>Following months of outcry on the campus, the administration gave the
 faculty 30 days to propose amendments to the plan. Those 30 days gave 
rise to a Faculty Senate resolution that endorsed a limited number of 
program closures at Tulsa — programs like the university’s minor in 
ancient Greek and its Ph.D. in mathematics.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>The senate would accept those closures, however, only if Tulsa agreed
 to take all academic-related stipulations of the True Commitment 
through faculty-elected committees, and then the full Faculty Senate; 
and if university leaders would consent to an audit of administrative 
expenses.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with The Chronicle, Clancy stressed that the 
True Commitment is not a static plan, and that he and Janet K. Levit, 
the provost, are open to “constructive criticism” in the future. True 
Commitment task forces are set to meet through the end of the year.</p>
