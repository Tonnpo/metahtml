<p>VATICAN CITY (<a href="https://www.churchmilitant.com/">ChurchMilitant.com</a>) - The Holy See is warning the Italian government that its proposed Zan bill against so-called homotransphobia would <a href="https://www.corriere.it/cronache/21_giugno_22/vaticano-ddl-zan-legge-testo-b13294ba-d2d0-11eb-9207-8df97caf9553.shtml">violate</a> the Concordat of 1985 between Italy and the Vatican city-state. </p>
<figcaption>Christian convert and former lesbian Nausica Della Valle</figcaption><p>"Some
 of the current contents of the legislative proposal reduce the freedom 
guaranteed to the Catholic Church by article 2, paragraphs 1 and 3 of 
the revised Concordat," Vatican foreign minister Bp. Paul Gallagher 
noted Thursday to the Italian embassy to the Holy See.</p>
<p>The intervention is without precedent in the history of the 
relationship between the two states since Italian dictator Benito 
Mussolini and cardinal secretary of state Pietro Gasparri signed the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Lateran-Treaty">Lateran Treaty</a> in 1929 recognizing papal sovereignty over Vatican City.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/concordat-of-1985">revised concordat</a>
 was signed in 1985 between the Vatican and the socialist government of 
Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, putting an end to Roman Catholicism as 
Italy's state religion. </p>
<p>According to article 2, paragraph 1, "The Italian republic recognizes
 the Catholic Church's full liberty to develop its pastoral, educational
 and charitable mission, and to evangelize and to sanctify." </p>
<p>The concordat continues, "In particular, the Church is assured the 
freedom to organize its affairs, to exercise public worship, to carry 
out its teaching and spiritual ministries, as well as to exercise its 
jurisdiction in ecclesiastical matters." </p>
<p>The third paragraph of article 2 assures "Catholics and their 
associations and organizations," the "full liberty of assembly and to 
express their thoughts orally and in writing, and by any other means of 
circulation." </p>
<p>The Vatican is contending that the Zan bill not only threatens 
"freedom of organization" — forcing Catholic schools to organize 
activities supporting the newly formed national day against 
"homotransphobia" — but also threatens Catholic "freedom of thought." </p>
<p>The Vatican's stance gives us great courage and hope in this battle for freedom.</p>
<p>The legislation, named for the Democratic Party lawmaker and gay 
rights activist Alessandro Zan, could criminalize the Catholic Church's 
teaching on homosexuality and even censor preaching against sexual 
pathologies like pedophilia, sadism and masochism.</p>
<p>Vatican press office director Matteo Bruni confirmed that a diplomatic communication had been sent on June 17.</p>
<p>Italian parliamentarian and faithful Catholic Vito Comencini told 
Church Militant that "the Vatican's stance gives us great courage and 
hope in this battle for freedom." </p>
<p>"When the Church really plays her part, she can really change 
history, and, for us politicians who are active in politics, this is 
very important," Comencini, the deputy leader of Matteo Salvini's Lega 
Party, said.</p>
<p> "Standing against the Zan bill means being in favor of freedom and 
rights. It also means rejecting gag laws, censorships and trials against
 those who defend the value of family and life," Comencini added. </p>
<p>In comments to Church Militant, Naiche Di Salvo, head of Evangelical 
Christian Action (ACE), Lazio, pointed out that "the Zan Bill is 
unconstitutional as it contrasts with the freedom of expression, 
enshrined in article 21 of the Italian Constitution." </p>
<p>The proponents of the new law want to arrive at a single-sex — a neutral sex. And they want to arrive at a single religion.</p>
<p>"In fact, in article 4 of the text, the Zan bill introduces a real 
crime of opinion," Di Salvo noted. "The bill also demolishes freedom of 
association and the equality of all religious confessions guaranteed by 
articles 8 and 18 of the Fundamental Charter of Rights of our country." </p>
<p>The ACE, representing 6,007 evangelical churches and working closely 
with Catholics, Orthodox and Anglicans, is among the associations which 
will be heard by the Senate Justice Committee on the Zan bill.</p>
<figcaption>Vito Comencini is fighting for the sanctity of marriage</figcaption><p>Church
 Militant spoke to Nausica Della Valle — a journalist and former lesbian
 who experienced a powerful conversion to Christ and gave up her sinful 
lifestyle — who is now campaigning against the Zan bill.</p>
<p>"The proponents of the new law want to arrive at a single sex — a 
neutral sex. And they want to arrive at a single religion," Della Valle 
warned, explaining why she was against the bill.</p>
<p>"Article 1 talks about [how] gender identity is a perceived identity 
wherein gender is self-determined. You are no longer allowed to say that
 the natural family is made up of a father and a mother, otherwise you 
are homophobic and risk two to six years in prison," she said.</p>
<p>"Article 4 permits freedom of opinion as long as it is not intended 
to discriminate against anyone. But who decides this? Because if you 
base everything on perception, I can say anything and they will say that
 I am homophobe, just as they do now," Della Valle noted.</p>
<p>"Just to say 'I'm no longer a homosexual,' I'm homophobic in their 
eyes. It's like putting a loaded gun in a child's hand," remarked Della 
Valle, who has narrated her testimony in her book <a href="https://www.amazon.it/dp/8898999674?tag=duc01-21&amp;linkCode=osi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1">Nausica: The Truth that Set Me Free</a>.</p>
<p>We find worrying the Vatican meddling in the law against homophobia.</p>
<p>Della Valle also stressed that article 7 intends to push LGBTQ+ 
indoctrination in schools: "They want to get to impart a gender ideology
 in schools for children from 6-years-old and up. This is becoming a 
dictatorship."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, gay rights activists <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/activists-vatican-meddling-italys-lgbt-rights-law-78418062">denounced </a>the Vatican's intervention as "unprecedented" meddling in Italy's legislative process. </p>
<figcaption>Gay activist Alessandro Zan</figcaption><p>"The government 
has the political and moral obligation to not only just resist pressure,
 but to unilaterally denounce this unprecedented interference in State 
affairs," the secretary of the Union of Atheists and Agnostic 
Rationalists, Roberto Grendene, said in a statement.</p>
<p>"We find worrying the Vatican meddling in the law against 
homophobia," Fabrizio Marrazzo, Gay Party for LGBT+ Rights spokesman, 
said. </p>
<p>Marrazzo called on Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government to 
"defend the laicity of the State" and "improve the law so that it truly 
has, at its heart, the fight against homophobia and transphobia."</p>
<p>Marrazzo called on Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government "defend 
the laicity of the state" and "improve the law so that it truly has at 
its heart, the fight against homophobia and transphobia."</p>
<p>Last June, Cdl. Gualtiero Bassetti, president of the Conference of 
Italian Bishops (CEI), issued a statement warning that "introducing 
further incriminating norms would risk a drift towards liberticide" and 
"subject to criminal proceedings those who believe that the family 
requires a dad and a mother," Church Militant <a href="https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/italys-homophobia-law-threatens-pulpit">reported</a>.</p>
