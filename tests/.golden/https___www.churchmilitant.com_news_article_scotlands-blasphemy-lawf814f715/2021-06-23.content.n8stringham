<p class="rm-manual"> TRANSCRIPT</p>
<p>Islam, since the beginning, has used brute force and deception to 
conquer, slaughter and enslave Christians. There are peaceful Muslims 
who don't authentically practice their faith and have adopted a more 
secularist attitude. However, as Church Militant's Trey Blanton reminds 
us, many Muslims in the West are merely wolves in sheep's clothing.</p>
<p>A prominent Muslim businesswoman in Scotland revealed the often 
hidden racism prevalent in Islamic communities. Naveed Raza was released
 last week after three days in jail, despite repeatedly threatening, 
over the course of years, to kill her son.</p>
<p>Raza's son brought shame upon the family by dating, with the intent of marriage, a white Scottish girl.</p>
<p>Raymond Ibrahim, author of Sword and Scimitar, explains, "Islam, 
itself, actually, you can say, is very racist. It's very diversionary 
and divisive. In fact, it has whole doctrines that make people, make 
Muslims dislike and, in fact, are called to hate non-Muslims."</p>
<p>The prosecutor in the case told the court, "The family holds Muslim faith and the accompanying cultural traditions." </p>
<p>Critics of the case see the meager fine, roughly the equivalent of 
$700, as hypocritical application of the recently passed Hate Crime and 
Public Order Law.</p>
<p>Robert Spencer, Islamic scholar and critic, cites as an example the 
2013 case of an 18-year-old woman who spent a year in jail for wrapping 
bacon around a mosque door.</p>
<p>The 2021 hate crime law is far stricter than prior laws, and lawyers 
say it will have a "chilling effect" on society. The Pakistani-Scottish 
politician who proposed the legislation attempted to add language that 
would allow family members and friends to report so-called hate speech 
spoken in the home.</p>
<p>Raymond Ibrahim: "It's a mini-sort of blasphemy law that's meant to 
curtail and silence any criticism against Muslims or Islam from the 
indigenous people in the U.K."</p>
<p>In the West, Muslims, even well-educated members, know to conceal 
their cultural traditions. But, in their homelands, like Pakistan, they 
openly practice hate.</p>
<p>Pakistani police are still delaying the arrest of Muslim gang members
 who, earlier this month, drugged and abducted a 17-year-old Christian 
boy. The teenager was tortured and sodomized for days before getting 
dumped onto a random street.</p>
<p>A human rights activist told Asia News, "For us," meaning Christians, "there is no justice and no equal rights."</p>
<p>Raymond Ibrahim: "The Islamic threat is actually a perennial threat 
that’s been going on for well over a millennium. It's, in fact, had 
profound impact on the development of Western Christian civilization, 
negatively, throughout history. And so, to actually be on guard now, is 
very much well-warranted."</p>
<p>Leftists openly denounce so-called white supremacists in America, but
 cry "Islamophobia" when legitimate criticism is made of Islam's 
embedded racism.</p>
<p>Unelected Joe Biden has tasked his Department of Justice with 
combating alleged white supremacy by urging family members to report 
so-called radical behavior to the FBI.</p>
