<h2>Submitted Written Testimony</h2>
<h3>I. Introduction </h3>
<p>Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Katko, and members of the 
committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today on 
the important topic of reforming the Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS or the department). For the past two years, I have led a project at
 the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) focused on reforming DHS,
 with a specific emphasis on selected law enforcement, intelligence, and
 border security and immigration aspects of the department’s work. I am 
grateful for the opportunity to share the insights developed through 
this project, and to work with this committee going forward in 
connection with its important oversight and legislative 
responsibilities. </p>
<p>Since this is my first appearance before this committee, I thought it
 might be useful to provide some additional information about my 
background and experience to give you a better sense of the perspective I
 bring to these issues. My grounding is as a 9/11-era operational 
counterterrorism and counterintelligence lawyer. I worked in the 
national security components of the Justice Department pre- and 
post-9/11 and was sent over to the FBI’s Strategic Information 
Operations Center the morning of 9/11 after the second tower was struck,
 where I continued to work over the days, weeks, and months thereafter, 
supporting the Justice Department’s national security operations. Most 
of my government experience from 2000–2010 was at the intersection of 
national security, foreign intelligence collection, and protecting civil
 liberties and privacy, including matters handled under the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act. As the first Justice Department National 
Security Division (NSD) detailee to the Office of General Counsel in the
 Office of the Director of National Intelligence from 2007–2009, I 
served as the primary legal advisor to the intelligence community’s 
Civil Liberties Protection Officer, and routinely provided advice to 
intelligence community executive leaders on what we then referred to as 
the “domestic intelligence” or, domestic security and intelligence 
portfolio. I was integrally involved in developing guidelines and 
interagency oversight processes related to national security 
investigations. Upon returning to the NSD front office in 2009, I 
co-chaired an interagency task force focused on improving processes 
related to intelligence, surveillance, and compliance. Since leaving 
government service in 2010, I have taught graduate-level law seminars at
 Georgetown Law on intelligence community reform and cybersecurity law 
and policy. Accordingly, I approach national and homeland security 
legislative and policy issues with the eye of both a practitioner and an
 academic. </p>
<p>As a result of these formative professional experiences, I have zero 
interest in going backward, and undoing nearly 20 years of changes to 
the laws and institutions that kept the country safe from an act of 
international terrorism on the scale of September 11, 2001. However—and 
this is important—2021 is not 2001. The threats to security and safety 
the country faces today are not the same. While some threats of the past
 have receded, they have not disappeared. Instead, threats to American 
security, safety, and health appear to have compounded. And our national
 and homeland security institutions which are designed to protect 
Americans from the threats they actually face need to keep pace. In 
short, I don’t just want us to develop a DHS that can meet today’s 
threats, I want to see a DHS that has the legislative framework, 
organizational capability, and trained, resourced, and expert workforce 
that is ready to meet tomorrow’s threats. </p>
