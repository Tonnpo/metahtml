<p>Each Friday, Cyber Security Hub scours the internet to provide readers with a notable ‘<a href="https://www.cshub.com/tag/incident-of-the-week" rel="noopener">incident of the week</a>.’
 The popularity of this type of article is growing on the CSHub.com 
website, most likely due to the fact that they are loaded with best 
practices and tips on incident response — whether it’s how to handle the
 situation, as well as in some cases, what not to do.</p>
<p>As we’re coming up on the first 6 months of 2019, we’re pausing to 
roundup what has happened so far. From password spraying to ransomware 
to data leaks (and everything in between), we looked into the numbers to
 see what is top-of-mind for CS Hub readers, and here are your top 5 
cyber security breach headlines so far, starting with the fifth 
most-viewed story and working our way down to #1:</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/incident-of-the-week-inside-the-phishy-wipro-breach" rel="noopener">5. Inside The Phishy Wipro Breach</a></h2>
<p>The Fast Facts: On April 15, investigative reporter Brian Krebs wrote
 about the breach of Indian IT outsourcing and consulting giant Wipro 
Ltd. According to KrebsOnSecurity.com, two trusted sources spoke 
anonymously to Krebs saying that Wipro’s systems were seen being used 
“as jumping-off points for digital phishing expeditions targeting at 
least a dozen Wipro customer systems. The security experts said Wipro’s 
customers traced malicious and suspicious network reconnaissance 
activity back to partner systems that were communicating directly with 
Wipro’s network.”</p>
<p>On April 17, Wipro was quoted in an Indian daily newspaper saying 
that it did in fact experience a phishing incident. Wipro confirmed its 
IT systems were hacked and said it hired a forensic firm to handle the 
situation, stating that it was ‘dealing with a multi-month intrusion 
from an assumed state-sponsored attacker’ and that Wipro’s systems were 
seen being used to attack at least a dozen of its clients.</p>
<p>Some Quick Tips: The handling of the incident (or lack thereof) has 
sparked some buzz among industry influencers, leaving Krebs compelled to
 later write a follow up article on the incident explaining that Wipro 
executives were asked on a quarterly investor conference call to respond
 to his reporting. Wipro COO Bhanu Ballapuram told investors that many 
of the details in Krebs’ reporting were in error, and implied that the 
breach was limited to a few employees who got phished.</p>
<p>Krebs decided to join the quarterly call and add a question on the 
incident to the queue to which Wipro gave him the opportunity to speak 
on the call. Security reporter Graham Cluley was able to record the bit 
of the call and post it on Twitter.</p>
<p>From the aforementioned series of events, Krebs offered a recap of 
Wipro’s public response so far in his follow up article of, “How not to 
acknowledge a data breach:”</p>
<ul> <li>Ignore reporter’s questions for days and then pick nits in his story during a public investor conference call.</li> <li>Question the stated timing of breach, but refuse to provide an alternative timeline.</li> <li>Downplay
 the severity of the incident and characterize it as handled, even when 
they’ve only just hired an outside forensics firm.</li> <li>Say the intruders deployed a “zero-day attack,” and then refuse to discuss details of said zero-day.</li> <li>Claim the IoCs you’re sharing with affected clients were discovered by you when they weren’t.</li> </ul>
<p class="">Story Update: According to a more recent <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/wipro-data-breach-threat-actors-evidence-since-2015-2031881" rel="noopener">article</a>
 published on May 2nd, the attackers were found to have used remote 
access tool ScreenConnect to compromise employee machines within Wipro. 
It has also been found that the attackers could be linked to older 
malicious activities from 2017 and even possibly 2015, and had reused 
most of the infrastructure of previous attacks for their current ones.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/incident-of-the-week-dunkin-donuts-reports-credential-stuffing-attack" rel="noopener">4. Dunkin’ Donuts Reports Credential Stuffing Attack</a></h2>
<p>The Fast Facts: Dunkin’ Donuts first reported a credential stuffing 
attack at the end of November last year, and is now notifying users of 
more account breaches following a new attack. This attack, which 
happened in January, is similar to the first in where hackers leveraged 
user credentials leaked at other sites to enter DD Perks rewards 
accounts.</p>
<p>The type of information stored in a DD Perks account, which provides 
repeat customers a way to earn points and get free merchandise or 
discounts, includes the user’s first and last names, emails (usernames) 
and a 16-digit DD Perks account number and QR code.</p>
<p>According to ZDNet, the hackers weren’t after users’ personal 
information stored in the rewards accounts; instead, they were after the
 account itself in order to sell on Dark Web forums.</p>
<p>Some Quick Tips: According to advice from Trend Micro, here are some ways to strengthen security against these types of attacks:</p>
<ul> <li>Practice good password hygiene. Avoid reusing the same email 
and password combination for multiple online accounts, and change your 
access credentials frequently.</li> <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. Layered protection is always better than single access authentication.</li> <li>Observe
 your network traffic and system. A significant increase in network 
inquiries, access, or slowdowns may indicate an attack. Run security 
software to find and remove malware infection.</li> </ul>

<h2><a href="https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/incident-of-the-week-toyotas-second-data-breach-affects-millions-of-drivers" rel="noopener">3. Toyota's Second Data Breach Affects Millions Of Drivers</a></h2>
<p>The Fast Facts: Toyota revealed the issue on its official website on 
March 29, 2019, saying the breach potentially affected 3.1 million 
people. The company is still looking into whether the cybercriminals 
could access and read the data but says the compromised server did not 
contain credit card details.</p>
<p>February was a disruptive month for Toyota, too, but in the 
Australian market. On February 21, 2019, Toyota stated it experienced an
 attempted cyber attack. The news came via a similarly brief press 
statement consisting of only five sentences.</p>
<p>The company said it did not believe the hackers accessed private 
customer or employee data in that instance. It also confirmed Toyota's 
IT team communicated with international cyber security experts for 
advice in getting to the bottom of the matter.</p>
<p>Lesson Learned: Since there are so few specifics about what happened 
surrounding Toyota's cyber security breaches, it's best for customers to
 be exceptionally vigilant regarding any communications from people 
claiming to be from Toyota or its subsidiaries. There's no way to know 
for sure, but the hackers could use the customer data obtained in the 
Japanese breach to orchestrate phishing attempts.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/incident-of-the-week-investigation-of-walmart-email-breach" rel="noopener">2. Investigation Of Walmart Email Breach</a></h2>
<p>The Fast Facts: The FBI is investigating allegations that employees 
from one of Walmart’s technology suppliers was illegally monitoring the 
retailer’s e-mail communication.</p>
<p>The New York Times reports that in late 2015 through early 2016, 
Compucom employees assigned to Walmart’s help desk were using their 
access to monitor specific e-mail accounts at the retailer and allegedly
 using that information to get an edge over competitors.</p>
<p>The scheme was discovered after a Compucom technician took a photo of
 an email about an internal Walmart disciplinary matter and sent it to a
 Walmart employee he had been chatting with on an instant messaging 
system, according to the F.B.I. filing.</p>
<p>Lesson Learned: The case exposes a potential vulnerability for 
companies that rely on contractors for technical work, giving outsiders 
broad access to sensitive internal documents with little oversight in 
the process. It also raises questions about how technicians hired to 
support the computer system of one of the world’s largest and most 
insular corporations were able to gather information from employee 
emails.</p>
<p>“Companies with an extensive communications network like ours require
 the support of different partners and a high level of trust,” Walmart 
spokesman, Randy Hargrove, told the NYT. “We relied on this vendor but 
their personnel abused their access and we want those responsible to be 
held accountable.”</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/6-lessons-learned-from-the-citrix-breach" rel="noopener">1. 6 Lessons Learned From The Citrix Breach</a></h2>
<p>The Fast Facts: On March 6, 2019, the FBI contacted Citrix to advise 
they had reason to believe that international cyber criminals gained 
access to the internal Citrix network, according to Stan Black, CISSP 
and the CSIO of Citrix.</p>
<p>While the FBI is still investigating the details, thehackernews.com 
reported that the Iranian-backed Iridium hacker group hit Citrix in 
December last year and again this time, stealing at least 6 terabytes of
 sensitive internal files, including emails, blueprints, and other 
documents.</p>
<p>The Iranian-linked hacking group was also behind recent cyber attacks
 against more than 200 government agencies worldwide, oil and gas 
companies, technology companies and other targets.</p>
<p>The hacker group’s proprietary techniques include bypassing 
multi-factor authentications for critical applications and services for 
further unauthorized access to VPN channels and SSO (Single Sign-On).</p>
<p>Some Quick Tips: Here are 6 key learnings every enterprise should 
apply to their organizations to avoid being part of a password spraying 
cyber attack:</p>
<ul> <li>Use strong passwords: Create a password that is not less than 
10 characters and preferably 16 characters; avoid using a common phrase,
 your name, nickname or address. Always use a unique password, never 
repeat and never store passwords in your browser.</li> <li>The NCSC 
advises firms to configure protective monitoring over 
externally-reachable authentication endpoints to look for password 
spraying attacks and enforce multi-factor authentication on 
externally-reachable authentication endpoints.</li> <li>Encourage checks of common passwords through Troy Hunt’s HaveIBeenPwned password checker, or other free or commercial tools.</li> <li>Consider using two or multi-factor authentication.</li> <li>Perform
 a routine systems check to make sure there aren't any easy access 
points, back doors or areas where privileges could be escalated.</li> <li>Check to make sure hackers haven’t added any additional user accounts.</li> </ul>
<p>Story Update: According to Securityweek.com, it is now being reported
 that the hackers had access to the company’s network for roughly five 
months:</p>
<p>“In a data breach notification submitted by Citrix this week to the 
California Office of the Attorney General, the company said the hackers 
had intermittent access to its network between October 13, 2018, and 
March 8, 2019.</p>
<p>The company also confirmed that the attackers removed files from its 
systems. Some of these files stored information on current and former 
employees and, in some cases, beneficiaries and/or dependents. The 
compromised data includes names, social security numbers, and financial 
information.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how many people have been impacted by the incident, but 
it’s at least 500 as California legislation requires companies to 
disclose breaches to authorities if more than 500 of the state’s 
residents are affected.”</p>
<p>Contacted by SecurityWeek, Citrix refused to say exactly how many are
 impacted. The company noted, “We are notifying all potentially impacted
 individuals out of an abundance of caution, and providing these 
individuals with credit monitoring and fraud protection services free of
 charge where possible.”</p>
