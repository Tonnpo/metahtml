<p>When unrest in Minneapolis spread to the city’s Longfellow 
neighborhood last year, Ruhel Islam opened his restaurant, Gandhi Mahal,
 for medics to treat injured protesters. The next night, rioters set 
fire to the police building and dozens of businesses in Longfellow, and 
by dawn, his restaurant lay in ashes.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post that went viral the same morning, his teenage 
daughter, Hafsa, quoted him as saying, “Let my building burn, justice 
needs to be served, put those officers in jail.”</p>
<h2>Why We Wrote This</h2>
<p>A neighborhood in Minneapolis, heavily damaged during protests a year
 ago, is trying to rebuild in a way that embodies ideals of diversity 
and equality, potentially offering a new model for urban redevelopment.</p>
<p>His words resonate a year later as more than an expression of 
forgiveness. Mr. Islam has helped form a neighborhood collective called 
Longfellow Rising that intends to rebuild the triangular, three-block 
zone that included Gandhi Mahal to further elevate – and celebrate – the
 neighborhood’s racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity.</p>
<p>The discussions that gave shape to Longfellow Rising yielded a 
governing principle that people of color would form the heart of the 
initiative and guide its progress. “I’m not interested in going back to 
‘normal,’” says Meena Natarajan, artistic and executive director of 
Pangea World Theater and a member of the collective’s board. “I think we
 can build a better community, a better city.”</p>
<p> Minneapolis</p>
<p>Former customers might regard the empty dirt lot where the Indian 
restaurant once stood as a burial plot for an immigrant’s dream. In 
2008, eight years after moving to Minneapolis and a dozen after arriving
 in America, Ruhel Islam realized the aspiration he had carried with him
 from his native Bangladesh. Defying the Great Recession, he opened 
Gandhi Mahal in the Longfellow neighborhood on the city’s south side, 
his path through the economic gloom lit with energy and optimism.</p>
<p>Mr. Islam’s restaurant soon gained a loyal following and citywide 
reputation for its vibrant cuisine and inviting ambience. In the dead of
 winter, when all lies fallow on the Minnesota tundra, he harvested 
peppers, spinach, tomatoes, and herbs from an aquaponics garden he built
 in the basement. Praise for his chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, and
 other classic Indian dishes spread beyond Minneapolis, eliciting 
satiated raves from Guy Fieri, who visited Gandhi Mahal in 2016 for his 
Food Network show “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.”</p>
<p>The restaurant’s success added to the gradual renaissance of 
Longfellow. The neighborhood of 5,000 residents, located a 10-minute 
drive from downtown Minneapolis, began to grow in size and diversity in 
the 1990s after stagnating for two decades as white residents departed 
for the suburbs. A steady flow of immigrants from Africa, Latin America,
 and South Asia settled in Longfellow and adjacent neighborhoods to 
raise families and re-imagine their future.</p>
<h2>Why We Wrote This</h2>
<p>A neighborhood in Minneapolis, heavily damaged during protests a year
 ago, is trying to rebuild in a way that embodies ideals of diversity 
and equality, potentially offering a new model for urban redevelopment.</p>
<p>Little reason existed for residents or business owners to wonder if 
the area’s revival would continue – until last May, when in the span of 
four days, a quarter century of progress went up in flames.</p>
<p>A bystander’s video captured Derek Chauvin, then a Minneapolis police
 officer, kneeling on the neck of George Floyd as two other officers 
held him down and a fourth stood watch. Mr. Floyd’s death on Memorial 
Day ignited protests that exploded into riots, and as vandals wrought 
destruction across the city, their rage crested in Longfellow. </p>
<p>The four officers worked out of the 3rd Precinct station, a block 
from Gandhi Mahal, and during the first two nights of unrest, Mr. Islam 
opened his space for medics to treat injured protesters. The next night,
 rioters set fire to the police building and dozens of businesses in 
Longfellow, and by dawn, his restaurant lay in ashes.</p>
<p>The grace he showed in the face of personal loss earned him 
recognition far beyond the renown of Gandhi Mahal. In a Facebook post 
that went viral the same morning, his teenage daughter, Hafsa, quoted 
him as saying, “Let my building burn, justice needs to be served, put 
those officers in jail.”</p>

 met by Minnesota state troopers during a protest against racial 
inequality on May 29, 2020, in the wake of the George Floyd killing in

<p>His words resonate a year later as more than an expression of

<p>The initiative exemplifies a model of redevelopment known as 
inclusive design that emphasizes public involvement and community 
cohesion. The racial justice movement has drawn attention to the concept
 as cities attempt to redress chronic economic and social inequities 
between minority and white residents.</p>
<p>The nonprofit group in Minneapolis consists of business and 
landowners, faith leaders, economic developers, and other community 
partners inspired by dual desires to stave off gentrification and 
promote economic equity for people of color. The effort to transform an 
area known to locals as Downtown Longfellow will seek to support and 
attract minority business owners, expand affordable living options, and 
create public and private spaces that embody ideals of racial justice 
and social equality.</p>
<p>The conviction of Mr. Chauvin in April on charges of second- and 
third-degree murder and manslaughter defused the lingering unease in 
Minneapolis without resolving the racial disparities brought to light by
 last year’s upheaval. Mr. Islam describes Longfellow Rising as a chance
 to set an example for the city by rooting the neighborhood’s renewal in
 the soil of unity. In his view, rather than a mass grave of ruined 
ambitions, his empty lot and those nearby represent a community garden 
where a shared vision of hope will flourish. </p>
<p>“We want people to come here to heal and grow through community, 
through art, through food,” he says. “I feel change happening, and I 
believe we can come up with something extraordinary.”</p>
<p>The protests that cascaded across Minneapolis revealed a solidarity 
between Longfellow’s merchants and residents. Downtown shopkeepers 
handed out bottled water and hand sanitizer to demonstrators and posted 
signs in windows calling for an end to racial injustice. Residents 
sought to keep watch over small businesses when riots erupted and later 
returned with brooms and trash bins to help store owners clear away 
debris and salvage belongings.</p>
<p>“This has long been an area where neighbors look out for each other. 
The unrest solidified that bond,” says Ingrid Rasmussen, lead pastor at 
Holy Trinity Lutheran Church and a member of Longfellow Rising’s board 
of directors. Church volunteers ran a distribution site to hand out 
food, clothing, and other donated goods for weeks after the disorder, 
and since early spring, Holy Trinity has flown a Black Lives Matter flag
 above its complex.</p>
<p>“There’s a sense we’ve never been so connected,” she says. “Out of tragedy has arisen a sense of responsibility to one another.”</p>
<p> <span>Ann Hermes/Staff</span> </p>
<p>“There’s a sense we’ve never been so connected. Out of tragedy has 
arisen a sense of responsibility to one another,” says Ingrid Rasmussen,
 lead pastor at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Rioters damaged or destroyed 1,500 businesses across Minneapolis and 
St. Paul, inflicting an estimated $500 million in losses. The casualty 
list in Longfellow ranged from grocery, drug, and department stores to 
cafes, coffee shops, and restaurants, along with the post office, a 
medical clinic, and an apartment building under construction.</p>
<p>The neighborhood’s downtown nestles in one crook of the intersection 
where Minnehaha Avenue meets Lake Street, a major commercial artery in 
South Minneapolis. Across the intersection, Target and a pair of grocery
 stores, Aldi and Cub Foods, have reopened since completing repairs. 
Construction has started on an AutoZone shop, a Wendy’s restaurant, and 
the apartment complex, all of which burned down last spring.</p>
<p>The recovery of corporate-owned businesses contrasts with the 
struggle of independent merchants to rebuild or finish repairs. The 
limited emergency funding provided by the city to small businesses in 
Minneapolis – about $7 million to date – forced many owners to pay for 
cleanup and removal of rubble. High construction costs and an uncertain 
economic climate jeopardize their ability to move forward.</p>
<p>“It’s been a disappointing response from city officials,” says Chris 
Montana, who with his wife, Shanelle, co-owns Du Nord Craft Spirits, 
five blocks from Longfellow’s downtown. Their warehouse flooded after 
vandals set a fire that tripped the sprinkler system. “We need allies. 
We need public officials to stick up for us.”</p>
<p>The state Legislature has proved less obliging than the city, with 
Republican lawmakers opposing a $300 million relief package for Twin 
Cities businesses, contending that Minneapolis officials mishandled the 
crisis a year ago. In the meantime, Longfellow has relied on its own 
resources and communal goodwill, much as occurred during the protests, 
when police pulled back as the neighborhood burned.</p>
<p>The Montanas established a recovery fund for Longfellow businesses 
that collected $750,000 in donations, and they distributed grants of 
$5,000 to $15,000 to dozens of recipients. The money enabled a 
Latino-owned barbershop in downtown to reopen and defrayed cleanup costs
 for a damaged restaurant run by a Somali family.</p>
<p>“But it’s nowhere near enough to meet the need,” says Mr. Montana, 
one of the country’s few Black distillery owners. He plans to launch a 
small-business incubator in the coming months to encourage minority 
ownership. “We want to see people of color running their own businesses 
and owning their own property. That’s how we can keep the neighborhood 
from gentrifying.”</p>
<p>Longfellow’s ethnic restaurants, tree-lined streets, and lower cost 
of living relative to most of Minneapolis had attracted a mix of young 
families, downtown workers, and retirees. The prospect of losing 
business owners of color who had nurtured the community’s reawakening 
surfaced as an early concern among neighborhood leaders after the 
protests.</p>
<p>Their initial conversations acted as a catharsis. In time, they 
recognized that the unwanted devastation and lack of city and state 
support presented an opportunity to recast the area’s destiny. </p>
<p>The discussions that gave shape to Longfellow Rising yielded a 
governing principle that people of color would form the heart of the 
initiative and guide its progress. Meena Natarajan, artistic and 
executive director of Pangea World Theater and a member of the 
collective’s board, likens the work to mounting a stage production – 
with a community cast of thousands.</p>
<p>“The first question you always have to answer in theater is, ‘What 
does it mean to create a sense of belonging?’ You have to create shared 
understanding to build trust in one another,” she says.</p>
<p>The liberal reputation of Minneapolis shrouds historical disparities 
in income, education, and housing in a city where white residents make 
up 60% of the population of 440,000. Ms. Natarajan, who emigrated with 
her husband from India to the United States in 1987, considers 
Longfellow Rising an effort to interrupt a status quo that consigns 
people of color to the cultural and socioeconomic margins.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in going back to ‘normal,’” she says. “I think we can build a better community, a better city.”</p>

<p>“I’m not interested in going back to ‘normal.’ I think we can build a
 better community, a better city,” says Meena Natarajan, executive 
director of the Pangea World Theater, standing in front of a door that 
the theater had built near a renewal project in the Longfellow 
neighborhood. </p>
<p>The coalition’s members joined forces to, in effect, hit “pause” on 
the typical redevelopment process that occurs in the wake of disaster 
and prioritizes reflexive replication of the past. The deliberate pace 
of planning has allowed the group to solicit and integrate public 
feedback and to focus beyond the coming year to the decades ahead.</p>
<p>The board hired a local design firm to assist with mapping out a new 
future for Downtown Longfellow by gathering ideas from residents, 
business owners, and other community members during a series of 
workshops this spring. The sessions served as a listening tour as 
participants dreamed out loud about resuscitating the area.</p>
<p>“So much about real estate tends to be, ‘You gotta act fast,’” says 
Jamie Schwesnedl, who co-owns Moon Palace Books, located a block from 
the barricaded, unoccupied police station. “That usually means you end 
up with a Subway shop, a cellphone store, a check-cashing place – maybe a
 Foot Locker if you’re lucky.” He explains that Longfellow Rising, 
instead of settling for “something that’s not terrible,” aspires to 
cultivate change on a generational scale.</p>
<p>“There’s this energy behind rebuilding and creating space for 
businesses owned by people of color and to have a cooperative approach,”
 says Mr. Schwesnedl, who serves on the coalition’s board. During last 
year’s protests, he rebuffed police officers who tried to commandeer his
 parking lot for use as a staging point, and he and his employees later 
posted a huge storefront sign that read “Abolish The Police.”</p>
<p>“This is a chance to build something in harmony with the memory of 
what happened here,” he says, “and to live the values of racial and 
social equality, not just talk about it.”</p>
<p>Longfellow Rising’s design plan strives to balance the version of 
downtown that fell to the flames with a new iteration that would rise 
from the ashes. The result could heal the neighborhood’s landscape and 
herald another renaissance.</p>
<p> Mr. Islam will rebuild Gandhi Mahal and add a food bank, an outdoor 
garden, and a shared community space to promote food justice and 
sustainable agriculture. Mr. Schwesnedl, who leases a pair of vacant 
lots next to his bookstore from his parents, will explore developing the
 properties with affordable housing and retail space for</p>
<p>minority-owned businesses.</p>
<p>Ms. Natarajan and Mr. Islam intend to collaborate on building a 
permanent home for Pangea World Theater on a lot adjacent to his 
restaurant where the offices of a nonprofit organization burned down. 
The multicultural theater company has earned acclaim for staging 
productions that examine themes of peace, human rights, and social 
justice, and Ms. Natarajan suggests that Pangea can provide emotional 
release for a community ruptured by collective trauma.</p>
<p>“What art gives us is an opportunity to come together to better 
understand each other,” she says, “and from that comes growth and 
compassion.” In that spirit, Longfellow Rising has commissioned a local 
Native American artist, Angela Two Stars, to conceive an interactive 
public artwork that will stand across from the police station. The tile 
installation will metamorphose from a cocoon into a butterfly over a 
period of months to symbolize the neighborhood’s ongoing transformation.</p>
<p>“Artists and the arts are a central force in the rebuilding of 
community,” Ms. Natarajan says. “People of color and communities of 
color are fighting to be heard, and we have the power to amplify those 
voices in our neighborhood.”</p>
<p>The coalition’s working proposal would establish a downtown plaza and
 other outdoor gathering spaces, improve pedestrian safety and access to
 public transit, and shift the area toward solar energy. The group’s 
emphasis on equity and sustainability wins praise from Minneapolis City 
Councilman Cam Gordon, who credits Longfellow’s business owners for 
persevering in the face of scarce public assistance following the riots.</p>
<p>“As a member of city government, it’s kind of unbelievable to me that
 we couldn’t do more to help them. I feel like we failed them,” says Mr.
 Gordon, whose ward includes Longfellow. He regards the nonprofit 
initiative as a possible blueprint for mending neighborhoods across the 
Twin Cities. “It’s a careful, thoughtful approach that shows local 
businesses and institutions can come together and be intentional about 
racial and social equality. It makes me hopeful.” </p>
<p>The strategy of inclusive design has infused life into languishing 
neighborhoods in Dallas, Detroit, Oakland, and elsewhere. An alliance of
 residents, community activists, and city planners in Pittsburgh banded 
together more than a decade ago to save a predominantly Black 
neighborhood hollowed out by urban renewal. The group received a $30 
million federal grant in 2014 to build 350 units of mixed-income 
housing.</p>
<p>The funding required for that kind of ambitious project explains, in 
part, why inclusive design remains rare. The economic inequities between
 minority and white residents in large cities parallel a similar 
imbalance in the business world that extends to access to bank loans.</p>
<p>The struggle to obtain capital thwarts minorities from owning 
businesses and property, and complicates their efforts to rebuild in the
 event of a calamity.</p>
<p>“There is no margin for most business owners of color,” says Henry 
Jiménez, executive director of the Latino Economic Development Center in
 St. Paul. “If you get wiped out, whether it’s by a hurricane or riots, 
rebuilding is extremely difficult.”</p>
<p>In Longfellow, where neighborhood leaders worry about gentrification 
sweeping away minority businesses, two factors enhance the prospects of 
rescuing the downtown. A handful of Longfellow Rising’s board members 
own their properties, and Holy Trinity Lutheran Church has offered to 
act as a short-term land bank.</p>
<p>The church’s willingness to hold on to properties for as long as 24 
months will give more time to business and land owners to line up 
financing, reducing the threat of foreclosure. Ms. Rasmussen describes 
the rationale for the decision in simple terms.</p>
<p>“We want to build back together,” she says. “We’re neighbors.”</p>

<p>Ruhel Islam, owner of the Gandhi Mahal restaurant that was burned 
down a year ago, waves to neighbors passing in front of his takeout 
business, Curry in a Hurry, on April 21, 2021, in the Longfellow 
neighborhood of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Ade Alabi moved to Minneapolis more than 30 years ago to work as an 
engineer. The Nigerian émigré later tapped his life’s savings to enter 
the real estate business, and in January last year, he acquired a 
century-old brick building next to Gandhi Mahal for $2.8 million. The 
32,000-square-foot space housed several minority-owned businesses, 
including a Latin nightclub, a Mexican restaurant, and a 
Spanish-language radio station.</p>
<p>In March, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down much of public life, and 
two months later, police killed Mr. Floyd. The building burned to the 
ground the same night as Mr. Islam’s restaurant.</p>
<p>After several months of waiting in vain for city aid, Mr. Alabi 
relates, he spent almost $500,000 from an insurance payout of $3 million
 on demolition and cleanup services. He estimates the cost of rebuilding
 would exceed $9 million.</p>
<p>“It’s a difficult situation and you feel unsure what to do,” says Mr.
 Alabi, a Longfellow Rising board member. He recalls the large 
gatherings for weddings and quinceañeras – a traditional Latin American 
celebration to mark a girl’s 15th birthday – that filled his building’s 
banquet hall.</p>
<p>“Yes, you can sell. But this was a place so important to the Latino 
and Hispanic communities,” he says. “I want to bring that back, to have 
events that make people happy. I want businesses run by people of color 
that are for people of color. Would another owner want that?”</p>
<p>The lack of city assistance pits his best intentions against 
financial reality, and with the uncertain timeline of Longfellow Rising,
 his lot and others could remain vacant over the summer. The scenario 
concerns Melanie Majors, executive director of the Longfellow Community 
Council, a nonprofit advocacy group.</p>
<p>“People talk about the need to heal. But driving through a wasteland 
doesn’t help people feel better,” she says. The boarded-up 3rd Precinct 
station intensifies the ambient discomfort. “The thing sits there as a 
horrible reminder of what happened and why it happened, and nobody from 
the city is telling us what they’re planning to do. It’s an abdication 
of responsibility.”</p>
<p>Still, as the city’s long year draws to an end, there are glimmers of
 a new dawn. A private-public fund unveiled in April will funnel $30 
million to damaged neighborhoods for redevelopment projects. The Lake 
Street Council, a nonprofit advocacy group for businesses along the 
thoroughfare, has distributed $8 million to hundreds of merchants and 
property owners from a recovery fund amassed through individual and 
corporate donations.</p>
<p>“All of Minneapolis is having a reckoning,” says Russ Adams, who 
manages the council’s recovery initiatives. “There’s a need for both 
urgency and patience.”</p>
<p>For Mr. Islam, who absorbed the demise of his restaurant with 
uncommon equanimity, staying busy eases his anxiety. A few months after 
Gandhi Mahal burned down, he opened Curry in a Hurry, a delivery and 
takeout spot. He has turned his frustration over the city’s sluggish 
response into motivation to revive his adopted neighborhood. He is 
determined to see Longfellow rising. </p>
<p>“The city isn’t going to do it for us,” he says. “So we’ll do it and tell the city, ‘We did it.’”</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Dear Reader,</p>
<p class="rm-manual">About a year ago, I happened upon this statement 
about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming 
heading of “do things that don’t interest you”:</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes 
social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, 
articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an 
insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a 
Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years 
earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie 
outside the box we are currently in.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke 
about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being 
global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran 
muffin of journalism.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going 
to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that 
too-small box that most human beings think they live in.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s
 hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not 
only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re 
known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any 
time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to 
bridge divides. We’re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere 
and saying, “You are bigger and more capable than you realize. And we 
can prove it.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">If you’re looking for bran muffin journalism, you 
can subscribe to the Monitor for $15. You’ll get the Monitor Weekly 
magazine, the Monitor Daily email, and unlimited access to 
CSMonitor.com.</p>
