<p>Rachel del Guidice: Reports continued to emerge saying that North 
Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is in critical condition after a recent 
surgery. I’m joined in a bonus episode of The Daily Signal Podcast by 
Bruce Klinger, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation who 
covers Northeast Asia, to discuss the situation. Bruce, it’s great to 
have you on The Daily Signal Podcast.</p>
<p>Bruce Klingner: Well, thanks for having me.</p>
<p> del Guidice: Well, thank you for being with us. We’ve all seen 
reports coming out this week that North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong Un, 
is in critical condition after recent surgery. Can you tell us what you 
make of all of these reports?</p>
<p> Klingner: Well, with anything in North Korea, it’s always hard to 
discern what is going on. Even when I was at the CIA, we had difficulty 
getting as much information as we would like. </p>
<p>It seems, though, that the rumors are overblown. We’re still waiting 
for more definitive information, but it seems that it’s all based on one
 single-source report, which simply said that Kim Jong Un had heart 
surgery, and he was recuperating in a villa. The next thing we knew is 
that CNN had a pretty sensationalist headline of “Kim Is In Grave 
Condition,” even though the wording of the article didn’t seem to back 
up the headline. </p>
<p>And then that just led to a frenzy, where some media even reported he
 was brain-dead, though they later deleted that tweet. So right now, the
 South Korean presidential Blue House is downplaying the reports. They 
say they haven’t seen anything different or unusual in Pyongyang.</p>
<p>People with sources in North Korea are saying that life in Pyongyang,
 the capital, does seem to be normal. Even some schools resuming after a
 [COVID-19] shutdown. North Korean broadcasting is normal, and even 
today they announced that in Kim’s name, greetings were sent to the 
Cuban president. </p>
<p>Now, we tend to be fairly cautious when we’re longtime Korea 
watchers. We’ve seen a lot of rumors in the past of not only Kim, but 
his father and grandfather before him, had a number of reports where 
they supposedly died and then they actually hadn’t. That said, we always
 are vigilant for what could be going on in North Korea. Both the 
grandfather and the father died, we didn’t know that they had died for a
 bit of time. </p>
<p>Even U.S. intelligence was reliant on official announcements. So, 
right now, I think the rumors are overblown, but that said, we have to 
remain vigilant for what could happen if there’s either a death or 
long-term sickness of Kim Jong Un, the leader.</p>
<p>del Guidice: Well, Bruce, given that added context, CNN had reported 
that Kim Jong Un had missed the celebration of his grandfather’s 
birthday on April 15th, and there were reports circulating even very 
recently this week saying this adds to speculation that can be more 
significant, because he’s missed something that he would never 
ordinarily miss. What would your response to that be?</p>
<p>Klingner: Well, that anniversary, which is the anniversary of the 
birth of Kim Il Sung, the grandfather, who was the founder of North 
Korea, is a very important holiday. So, that did raise questions even 
before these latest rumors. </p>
<p>That said, the celebrations this year were more muted perhaps because
 of concern about [COVID-19] and the impact of having large crowds 
together. And in the past, both Kim and his father have missed certain 
events that were seen to be very important at the time, but then they 
came out of isolation, and whether they were recovering from a health 
issue or had just chosen not to go. </p>
<p>So, it’s an indicator, but I don’t think it’s a critically important indicator.</p>
<p>del Guidice: If Kim Jong Un were to pass away or be in a prolonged 
critical condition that would make him unable to retain his previous 
position, what would his possible successors, and who would they be?</p>
<p> Klingner: Well, we’d be in unprecedented territory, as we were both 
when the grandfather and the father died. The North Korean Constitution 
still doesn’t have any stipulations for formal succession, so we don’t 
know who would take the ring of power. </p>
<p>Up until a few years ago, the common assessment was that this very 
Confucian, very traditional Korean culture would never allow a woman to 
become the ruler. Therefore, any Kim family member that was a woman 
would be ineligible. </p>
<p>That said, Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, in the last two years has 
gained a lot of prominence, a lot of authority, and so she may be the 
front-runner right now to take over from Kim, if he were to become 
incapacitated.</p>
<p>She may be the only one he really trusts. What we’ve seen is, since 
Kim came into power in 2011, he’s replaced even the most senior level of
 leaders, the minister of defense, at least six times; the chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at least six times. </p>
<p>So, no one really has a great deal of authority, perhaps except for 
the sister. So, she may be right now the most likely to succeed him, as 
unrealistic or as unlikely as that seemed even a year or so ago.</p>
<p> del Guidice: If she or someone else were to take the reins, do you 
think there’s any hope for a revolution or a good political outcome in 
North Korea, if Kim Jong Un were to die?</p>
<p> Klingner: Well, a lot of people would predict, as after the death of
 the father, Kim Jong Il, that this could lead either to an explosion in
 the sense of North Korea lashing out at South Korea or the U.S., or an 
implosion-of-regime collapse, civil war, loss of control over nuclear 
weapons. </p>
<p>But as we’ve seen with the previous leadership successions, I think 
the regime would do the most it could to maintain its stability and its 
existence. So, whether people around the sister or some alternative 
nominee, I don’t think necessarily that it’s going to lead to an 
explosion or an implosion.</p>
<p>That said, there’s really no indications that the regime is going to 
change its policies. There’s no soft-liner or secret person in North 
Korea that’s going to do a Jeffersonian democracy. So, I think the 
regime would continue, regardless of who’s in charge. And the policies 
are likely to remain, both the socialist domestic economic policies, and
 the very strong threatening foreign and security policies. </p>
<p>They made clear they don’t want to give up their nuclear weapons. 
They see that as central to their security, and they’ve really shut the 
door on negotiations with Washington and South Korea about not only 
nuclear programs, but really any kind of diplomatic dialogue.</p>
<p>del Guidice: … If Kim Jong Un were to die, would the United States’ 
position with North Korea change at all? I know Fox has reported that 
the U.S. is working on a contingency plan right now in case he were to 
die. So, what do you think this type of plan could possibly look like?</p>
<p> Klingner: Well, the U.S. along with our allies, South Korea and 
Japan, have a number of contingency plans—everything from responding 
with full-scale invasion by the North, to a number of other, not only 
lower-level military attacks or security threats, but also unrest or 
collapse in the North. </p>
<p>So, there’s a range of plans, and certainly, the Pentagon would be 
revising or updating them now, if they hadn’t already. But if there was 
uncertainty in the leadership in the North, I don’t think that the U.S. 
or its allies would be well-advised to try to rush in, in our own 
invasion. </p>
<p>It’s a country that has a million-man army, it’s got 60 or more 
nuclear weapons. It’s got missiles that can [reach] not only South Korea
 [and] Japan, but the continental U.S. So, unless we felt threatened by 
the loss of authority, it’s not something we want to rush into North 
Korea, potentially initiating a war with a nuclear-armed state.</p>
<p>del Guidice: Well, Bruce, speaking of nuclear weapons, do you think 
the U.S. faces more or less danger of a nuclear attack from North Korea 
if Kim Jong Un dies or is sick than we did before?</p>
<p> Klingner: Well, the biggest concern would be if there was a loss of 
control by the regime and then it devolved into different factions 
fighting for control. </p>
<p>And then we’d be very nervous about who was controlling the nuclear 
weapons and whether they had firm control of them. So, any kind of 
change in the North will cause a great deal of concern and even fear 
amongst military and intelligence circles. </p>
<p>Oftentimes, the alert status will go up or the readiness level will 
go up just in case there’s some kind of consequences from an ill-done 
change in leadership. So, we would be very concerned, and we would 
probably have our missile-defense forces and others on a higher state of
 alert or readiness levels.</p>
<p>del Guidice: Fox News is also reporting that there’s a likelihood of a
 humanitarian crisis if Kim Jong Un dies, and that the plan would rely 
heavily on China to step in and manage a situation on the ground inside 
North Korea, partly due to China’s proximity and all the logistical 
challenges that the U.S. faces providing humanitarian assistance. What’s
 your perspective here on this?</p>
<p> Klingner: Well, over the years, the U.S. has repeatedly tried to 
reach out to the China to discuss contingencies in case of humanitarian 
disaster or collapse. And Beijing has always been very reluctant to 
discuss plans. </p>
<p>The South Korean government has repeatedly emphasized that the Korean
 Peninsula is Korean, and that South Koreans in conjunction with the 
North Korean people should be the determiners of their fate. </p>
<p>So, we don’t know what issues might be a catalyst for China going in,
 either to put in place someone that they would like to replace Kim Jong
 Un or just to prevent a huge outflow of refugees across the 
Chinese-North Korean border. </p>
<p>So, it’s something that we want to be discussing with Beijing ahead 
of time, but unfortunately Beijing has often been very reluctant to 
discuss sort of mutual or joint plans.</p>
<p>del Guidice: How is the North Korean media portraying the situation 
right now? I know you said, obviously there is no free press there, so 
are they talking about it? And if they are, how are they talking about 
it?</p>
<p> Klingner: They’re not talking about it at all. The broadcasting 
today is normal. They are just having normal news issues on their TV and
 print media. So, they aren’t indicating any kind of concern or worry, 
which either indicates that the reports are false or overblown, or just 
as happened when the father and the grandfather died, the media didn’t 
report anything, even though the leader may have already been dead or 
had a stroke, until the regime decided to announce it. </p>
<p>And then they switched to 180 degrees to, “the Leader has passed on.”
 So, the North Korean media is an indicator, but also not necessarily an
 all-inclusive indicator.</p>
<p>del Guidice: Well, during an interview in Bloomberg, former U.S. 
Secretary [of Defense] Leon Panetta had said that if it is true that Kim
 Jong Un is unwell, it could be a serious security threat to the U.S., 
because the Kim family has been the sole regime in North Korea for over 
60 years. What is your perspective there?</p>
<p> Klingner: Certainly, North Korea has been a threat ever since its 
creation in the late 1940s. It has a very large military, not only 
conventional forces, but nuclear and missile, and even biological and 
chemical weapons. And they also have proliferated nuclear and missile 
technology. </p>
<p>They’re committing crimes against humanity, against their own people,
 as well as engaged in a lot of illicit activities, including in the 
U.S. financial system. So, it really is a multispectrum threat to the 
United States and our allies.</p>
<p> But, right now the situation is stable. It’s not necessarily good. 
We continue to be threatened by them, but it’s stable. Our forces 
overseas are part of the deterrence to prevent North Korea from going 
too far to intimidate ourselves or our allies. </p>
<p>If there is a leadership change, successful or unsuccessful, there 
will be that concern of what could go wrong or what might a new leader 
do, especially if the situation is deteriorating. So, North Korea is a 
threat, both when it’s stable and when it’s unstable.</p>
<p>del Guidice: So, if Kim Jong Un were to die, what would the next steps for the country be?</p>
<p> Klingner: Well, we’d have to see who consolidated power; whether 
they did consolidate power. I wouldn’t envision some major announcement 
of change in their policy. I think instead they would try to adhere [to]
 the policies of the past, which have been sort of threatening to their 
own citizens, as well as to the neighbors. </p>
<p>So, there’s no person or group we can point to that would be similar 
to a Nelson Mandela or Aung San Suu Kyi, or [Vaclav] Havel in 
Czechoslovakia. And there’s no government in exile. There’s no 
alternative leadership that we could see, other than what’s already in 
the country.</p>
<p> Some might think or hope that the people would rise up against the 
regime, but they’ve been cowed for so many decades, the security 
services are so pervasive and brutal in their enforcement of North 
Korean control over the people. So, we’re not sure that there would be 
any kind of uprising against the regime. And if it was, it could become 
quite bloody if the regime is pushing back against the citizens.</p>
<p>del Guidice: Well, Bruce, thank you so much for sharing your 
perspective and for joining us today on The Daily Signal Podcast. We 
appreciate it.</p>
<p>Klingner: Well, thanks for having me.</p>
<p>del Guidice: And thanks for listening to today’s bonus episode. We do
 appreciate your patience as we record remotely during these weeks. </p></article>
