<h1 class="rm-manual">VX Exit: Final Projectiles Transferred for Destruction</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">By <a href="https://www.defensemedianetwork.com/author/u-s-army-press-release/" rel="author">U.S. Army Press Release</a> <span>- May 6, 2021</span> </p>

<p>The United States is one step closer to an international treaty goal,
 as Blue Grass Chemical Activity (BGCA) chemical crews supported 
delivery of the last of the nation’s stockpiled VX projectiles for 
destruction.</p>
<p>“Our chemical crews and support elements have really risen to this 
challenge,” said Lt. Col. Edward Williams, BGCA commander. “Not only did
 they accomplish this objective during a pandemic, but under the threat 
of severe weather and a February ice storm as well.”</p>
<p>Part of the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Activity, BGCA safely and 
securely stores the nation’s chemical weapons, one of two remaining 
stockpile locations, and supports delivery of them for destruction. This
 week marks a BGCA milestone when the last of nearly 13,000 VX 
nerve-agent-filled projectiles stored on Blue Grass Army Depot (BGAD) 
were delivered to the Blue Grass Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant.</p>
<p>Crews of trained toxic material handlers began moving munitions 
mid-2019 at the start of the ongoing H-mustard projectile campaign. The 
experienced chemical crews, inventory specialists, Quality Assurance 
Specialist/Ammunition Surveillance inspectors and monitoring personnel 
ensure each delivery is performed safely and in accordance with all 
governing regulations.</p>

<p>“It really is a team effort, not just between the governmental 
agencies and contractors, but also within the BGCA,” said David 
Velazquez, director of chemical operations. “We’ve been moving munitions
 for nearly two years now. From the monitoring of the earth-covered 
magazines by monitoring systems operators, the accountability of the 
ammunition by inventory specialists, to the loading of the ammunition by
 the toxic material handlers, each component is an integral element to 
our organizational success.”</p>
<p>Nichole Mego, lead inventory management specialist, noted the importance of one of those components, inventory management.</p>
<p>“Our main role is accountability,” she said. “We verify which 
munitions are being transported from the igloo and ensure the correct 
munitions are selected before the enhanced on-site container is loaded.”</p>
<p>Following munitions verification, inventory specialists ensure 
documentation is complete and correct before conducting a full inventory
 of the munitions remaining in the earth-covered magazine.</p>
<p> Munitions accountability is crucial for BGCA to maintain compliance 
with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons which 
enforces the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).</p>
<p>This international treaty bans the use and production of chemical 
weapons and directs disposal of remaining stockpiles. With the VX 
projectiles delivered for destruction, the U.S. is one step closer to 
meeting its treaty goal.</p>
<p>BGCA continues to support delivery of mustard munitions to BGCAPP for
 destruction. The next destruction campaign is slated to begin in fall 
2021. Chemical weapons destruction at BGAD is scheduled to be complete 
by the end of 2023.</p>
