<p>In her first TV interview, we speak with Emily Wilder, the young 
reporter fired by the Associated Press after she was targeted in a 
Republican smear campaign for her pro-Palestinian activism in college. 
Wilder is Jewish and was a member of Students for Justice in Palestine 
and Jewish Voice for Peace at Stanford University before she graduated 
in 2020. She was two weeks into her new job with the AP when the 
Stanford College Republicans singled out some of her past social media 
posts, triggering a conservative frenzy. The AP announced Wilder’s 
firing shortly thereafter, citing unspecified violations of its social 
media policy. “Less than 48 hours after Stanford College Republicans 
began to post about me, I was fired,” says Wilder. “I was not given an 
explanation for what social media policy I had violated.” Over 100 AP 
journalists have signed an open letter to management protesting the 
decision to fire Wilder, which came just days after Israel demolished 
the building housing AP offices and other media organizations in Gaza. 
Journalism professor Janine Zacharia, a former Jerusalem bureau chief 
for The Washington Post who taught Wilder at Stanford, says the episode 
is an example of how much pressure news organizations face on Middle 
East coverage. “I am very aware, perhaps more than most, to the 
sensitivities around the questions of bias and reporting on the 
conflict,” says Zacharia. “In this case it wasn’t about bias.”</p>

<p class="rm-manual">This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: The Associated Press news 
service is facing growing criticism for firing a young reporter after 
she was targeted by a right-wing smear campaign for her pro-Palestinian 
activism while she was a college student at Stanford.</p>
<p>Emily Wilder is Jewish. She was a member of Students for Justice in 
Palestine and also the group Jewish Voice for Peace at Stanford 
University before she graduated in 2020. She was an intern at The 
Arizona Republic before the AP hired her for an entry-level role in 
Phoenix, and was two weeks into her new job when the Stanford College 
Republicans began highlighting some of her past tweets. Their campaign 
was then amplified by right-wing media and politicians, including 
Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton. The AP says it fired Wilder for 
violating its social media policy. The decision came just days after 
Israeli forces bombed the building housing the AP’s office in Gaza.</p>
<p>Ten senior AP executives stood by the decision to fire Emily Wilder, 
noting in a leaked memo to editorial staff, quote, “We did not make it 
lightly,” referring to the decision. The AP’s executive editor, Sally 
Buzbee, did not sign the memo. She begins her new job next month as 
executive editor at The Washington Post. She’s making history as the 
first woman executive editor of The Washington Post. She told <span>NPR</span> she has, quote, “handed over day-to-day operations” at AP, so, quote, “I was not involved in the decision at all.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, journalists at the AP protested Wilder’s firing in an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19srByafx4z79bMRm4buo5u7Fm1bj5EShTkj1gdGUzTg/view">open letter</a>
 Monday, writing, quote, “It has left our colleagues — particularly 
emerging journalists — wondering how we treat our own, what culture we 
embrace and what values we truly espouse as a company,” unquote.</p>
<p>For more, we go to Phoenix, Arizona, to speak with Emily Wilder in 
her first television broadcast interview. We’re also joined by Janine 
Zacharia, who was Emily Wilder’s journalism professor at Stanford 
University. She’s the former Jerusalem bureau chief for The Washington 
Post.</p>
<p>We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Emily, why don’t you just take us through what happened to you?</p>
<p><span>EMILY</span> <span>WILDER</span>: Absolutely. Well, first of all, thank you so much for having me.</p>
<p>Last Monday, a group from my alma mater, the Stanford College 
Republicans, began to post online past posts that I had made on social 
media, in an attempt to expose my history of activism for Palestinian 
human rights while I was an undergraduate at Stanford University, and in
 an attempt to link AP to Hamas. In the next two days, I began to 
receive a lot of harassment, a lot of pretty heinous harassment, as well
 as prominent Republicans on the internet began to lambaste me, 
including Senator Tom Cotton and Ben Shapiro.</p>
<p>I was reassured during this time by my editors that I would not face 
repercussions for my past activism and that they just wanted to support 
me while I was facing this smear campaign. But less than 48 hours after 
the Stanford College Republicans began to post about me, I was fired. 
The reason given was a supposed social media violation sometime after I 
joined AP on May 3rd. I was not given an explanation for what social 
media policy I violated or what tweet had violated policy, and I still 
have not received an explanation.</p>
<p><span>JUAN</span> GONZÁLEZ: And, Emily, when you were originally 
hired, what were you told by the Associated Press of what its social 
media policy was for its reporters?</p>
<p><span>EMILY</span> <span>WILDER</span>: I was told that reporters must not share opinions online, must not show bias in coverage.</p>
<p><span>JUAN</span> GONZÁLEZ: And you were covering — what were you covering while you were at the AP?</p>
<p><span>EMILY</span> <span>WILDER</span>: Well, I was hired as a news 
associate on the West Desk, which covers the western United States, 14 
states in the western United States. And my position is not actually a 
reporting position; it was an entry-level kind of apprenticeship, an 
editorial and production apprenticeship. And so, I was concerned with 
assisting coverage in the western United States.</p>
<p><span>JUAN</span> GONZÁLEZ: So, in effect, why would these folks at 
Stanford target you? It seems almost nonsensical they would go after you
 in this concerted and campaign-like manner.</p>
<p><span>EMILY</span> <span>WILDER</span>: Well, first of all, this is 
not my first encounter with this group. During my time at Stanford, they
 built a reputation as kind of bullies. They antagonized really any 
student they disagreed with. And I was in their crosshairs more than 
once. So they knew my name, and I guess they did not forget about me. 
And I can’t say for certain why they did what they did, but perhaps they
 learned that I had joined a national news organization at a moment that
 that news organization was under public scrutiny, and they took it as 
an opportunity to both smear me and smear the Associated Press.</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: On Monday, the union 
representing Washington Post reporters — now, of course, Emily was 
working for the AP, but the union representing Washington Post reporters
 tweeted, quote, “Solidarity with the staff of the @AP and Emily Wilder.
 We hope management provides swift answers on her termination and 
clarifies the newsroom’s social media practices,” unquote. The AP said 
in a memo to staff Monday it plans to review its social media policies. 
Now, the significance of The Washington Post writers’ union expressing 
solidarity is that Sally Buzbee, the executive editor of AP, is going to
 become the first woman executive editor of The Washington Post, 
beginning in June, which brings us to our next guest, Janine Zacharia, a
 professor at Stanford University who taught Emily Wilder. You were The 
Washington Post bureau chief in Jerusalem, is that right, about a decade
 ago?</p>
<p><span>JANINE</span> <span>ZACHARIA</span>: That’s correct.</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: So, can you talk about this controversy?</p>
<p><span>JANINE</span> <span>ZACHARIA</span>: So, I want to speak about 
it on two levels. I want to speak personally, as Emily’s instructor at 
Stanford, what this has been like, and then I want to speak in the macro
 about what I think is really happening here.</p>
<p>So, personally, I want to say that when Emily called me to tell me 
that she had been fired by the AP, I literally was shocked. I was really
 shocked, because — and I really didn’t know what to say. And I said to 
Emily, “Close your laptop. I need to call you back,” because I really 
need to think about what’s happening here, what we’re going to do and 
how am I going to help my brilliant former student continue with a 
career in journalism, because, yes, I spent most of my career, close to 
two decades, reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I started my
 career as a young woman in Jerusalem in an earlier incarnation, in the 
’90s, for Reuters. So I am very aware, perhaps more than most, to the 
sensitivities around the questions of bias and reporting on the 
conflict.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as was mentioned, in this case it wasn’t about bias. 
And it wasn’t even about, I don’t think, social media policies, because 
if you review what Emily posted since she started at the AP, there was 
one tweet that mentioned a mild opinion about the question of 
objectivity on reporting on the conflict and the language we use, and an
 editor could have come to her and said, “I think you should take down 
that tweet, because it expresses an opinion in violation of our social 
media policies. Doesn’t mean you can’t have these opinions, but you 
can’t broadcast them on social media.” But I think that the bigger issue
 in this case, if you read the letter of her dismissal, was that it 
mentions you cannot have any conflict that could be perceived as a bias 
or leading to accusations of bias. Something to that effect was the 
language.</p>
<p>And so, when the Stanford College Republicans documented some of her 
pro-Palestinian activism in college, I think they got a little spooked, 
because it was in the context, as Emily mentioned, of Israel’s strike on
 the Gaza bureau and Hamas, and people who wanted to defend that strike 
were trying to accuse AP of knowingly sharing a building with Hamas — 
when Hamas rules the Gaza Strip for 15 years; they’re everywhere — and 
this was a way to continue to fuel that narrative: “Look, you hired this
 news associate who has pro-Palestinian views.” And so, it really was a 
full-on disinformation campaign against not only Emily, but the AP. 
These are actors who are not interested in having a serious conversation
 about how we cover the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They want to take 
down credible, fact-based news organizations.</p>
<p><span>JUAN</span> GONZÁLEZ: And, Janine Zacharia, what are some of 
the unusual pressures that reporters who are covering the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict have to deal with, especially here in the 
United States?</p>
<p><span>JANINE</span> <span>ZACHARIA</span>: You know, I think the 
number-one one is this perception of — there’s one — there’s a couple, 
OK? First of all, it’s a conflict of dueling narratives. And when you 
are trying to do objective reporting on the conflict, you know, you do —
 and this is the way it is — you try and figure out what’s going on, 
what do people say happened at that checkpoint, what happened right now 
with the bombing of the building, whatever, and you evaluate the 
information that’s given to you.</p>
<p>You know, if you take a walk in my inbox from 2009, 2010, 2011, when I
 was there for The Washington Post — you know, social media was still in
 its infancy, but I received so much hate mail. Nothing like what 
happened to Emily now could have happened to me, because there were no 
Twitter mobs back then, really. “You’re pro-Zionist.” “You’re 
pro-Palestinian.” “You’re this.” “You’re that.” And it could be very 
intense.</p>
<p>You know, I remember when I covered — there was an incident of what 
was called the flotilla. The Mavi Marmara was an aid shipment going to 
Gaza, and I was in the Gaza Strip for The Washington Post. And I got 
woken up around this time, 4 or 5 a.m., and I was told that the 
Israelis, <span>IDF</span>, had killed — or maybe it was the Navy or 
whatever, whoever — there was images of them dropping onto this Turkish 
aid ship — had killed nine people. And so I started writing for The 
Washington Post. I was doing radio. And I got a call that night from a 
very senior Israeli official yelling about this A1 story I had written 
for The Washington Post. And the Israelis hadn’t — the Israelis hadn’t 
released any information. It was like we were trying to — it was hard, 
in other words. So you do your best to cover this conflict as best as 
you can.</p>
<p>And what I do at Stanford is take people like Emily, brilliant 
students who care about the world, who have deep social conscience, who 
study history, who know what’s going on in the world, and I try to train
 them to channel that social conscience into accountability journalism. 
And what’s so distressing to me about this incident is Emily shouldn’t 
have to and can never erase who she was — right? — before joining the 
AP. And if they decide that because she was a pro-Palestinian activist, 
attacked by a student group, amplified by a right-wing smear campaign 
against her, then they’re going to — what does this mean? Does this mean
 that any student who was an activist in college — which is what 
students do, they’re activists in college — can’t become a journalist? 
You know, what happens if they’re activists on abortion or climate 
change? Or is this specifically about Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
because of the pressures that these news organizations feel?</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: I wanted to read what Ari Paul, who wrote about Emily Wilder for <span>FAIR</span>,
 later wrote on Facebook. He said, “She was not some famous firebrand. 
She wasn’t appointed to some high-level post like Jerusalem 
correspondent. She’s a college grad who had a low-level job at a 
domestic bureau. But it’s clear that right-wing organizations are 
keeping tabs on all sorts of college activists and keeping track of 
where they end up working. And the right is clearly organized to follow 
and stalk them and ruin their lives, or at least attempt to.” Emily, can
 you comment on this? And talk about what the Associated Press said to 
you before you joined. I mean, it wasn’t a secret that you were part of —
 you were a Jewish student, you were part of Jewish Voice for Peace, and
 also you were part of the group for justice in Palestine.</p>
<p><span>EMILY</span> <span>WILDER</span>: I think that that post is 
absolutely right, especially considering my post was in the western 
United States. My beat was totally unrelated to the Middle East. Like 
Janine said, yes, I have opinions about the Israel-Palestine conflict as
 a citizen of the world, but also as a Jewish American who grew up in a 
Jewish community. And, yes, I have history of activism on that issue. 
Neither of those facts prevent me from being able to do fair, credible, 
fact-based reporting, especially when the beats are entirely unrelated 
to the Middle East.</p>
<p>But also, I want to take it a step further and say that the values 
that led to my activism, the values of compassion and justice that 
compelled me to speak out loudly and advocate for Palestinian human 
rights, those values are powerful assets in my reporting. And I don’t 
think newsrooms should try to get me to yield those values. And I really
 hope that I can continue to channel those values in accountability 
journalism, like Janine said.</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: I also want to point out that more than a hundred Associated Press employees signed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19srByafx4z79bMRm4buo5u7Fm1bj5EShTkj1gdGUzTg/view">letter</a>
 in support of you, Emily, that read, in part, quote, “Wilder was a 
young journalist, unnecessarily harmed by the AP’s handling and 
announcement of its firing of her. We need to know that the AP would 
stand behind and provide resources to journalists who are the subject of
 smear campaigns and online harassment.”</p>
<p>I also wanted to ask both Emily and Professor Zacharia about this 
timing of when this happened. You know, I was watching — while Sally 
Buzbee said she’s not involved with day-to-day now at AP because she’s 
going over to The Washington Post to head that news organization, she 
was on television talking about the bombing of the AP offices in Gaza, 
talking about calling for an investigation, and the intimidation this 
meant for the fact that there would be fewer voices reporting out of 
Gaza, and how critical that was. Emily, if you could talk about this? 
And then I’d also like to ask Janine Zacharia to go broader, both of 
you, on the coverage of Israel and Palestine. There was just a major 
petition that was signed by many to Canadian journalism organizations 
talking about the fact that they’re not even supposed to use the word 
“Palestine.”</p>
<p><span>EMILY</span> <span>WILDER</span>: I can’t really speak to which
 executives within the Associated Press were involved in the decision to
 fire me, partly because I received so little information when I was 
fired. And still I have received so little information. But I agree with
 you, the timing is really important to the story here. I mean, it’s a 
perfect storm. We have the event in Gaza with the AP office a couple 
days ago. We have — people have made links between my treatment and the 
treatment of other journalists, like Chris Cuomo on <span>CNN</span>. 
And this is also happening within a moment that newsrooms are reckoning 
with this question about social media objectivity, past activism, 
diversity of life experiences. And I think that that’s why, you know, my
 former colleagues at the Associated Press — that’s partially why they 
felt so compelled to speak out. And seeing that is really encouraging 
and uplifting as a young journalist.</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: I should also point out that — and a number of others have done this — Wolf Blitzer, a main anchor on <span>CNN</span>, formerly worked for <span>AIPAC</span>,
 the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. He hasn’t been fired or 
prevented from reporting on Israel and Palestine. Professor Janine 
Zacharia, would you like to comment?</p>
<p><span>JANINE</span> <span>ZACHARIA</span>: You know, I just — there’s
 so many things that are upsetting about all this. But, you know, if 
you’re going to go down the road of — in general, of, “OK, well, Emily 
was with Jewish Voice for Peace, and Wolf Blitzer was for <span>AIPAC</span>,”
 the answer has to be, you know, judge your reporters based on their 
work. Right? Because it’s insane to think that journalists don’t have 
passions and opinions, because the very people who go into journalism, 
as you very well know, Amy, are people who are passionate and have 
opinions about things in the world. And so, it’s just — that’s 
distressing.</p>
<p>And also, I just want to echo something that Emily said about how 
they still haven’t told her really what’s going on. To me, as her 
instructor, as someone who maybe feels like I entrusted my young student
 with them, this is shocking to me that they didn’t do more to sort of 
talk to her about it. And I think it’s because it really wasn’t about 
social media policy.</p>
<p>And this is something that the AP and other news organizations really
 need to think about. Who are we going to let work in our newsrooms? How
 are we going to deal with — I mean, if you have, for example, a whole 
generation of students who went to Black Lives Matter protests last 
summer, and then they come and take my journalism class at Stanford or 
another university, and they say, “You know what? I want to be a 
journalist,” and their lives live on TikTok and Instagram and all that, 
are all these journalists not — are these students not going to be able 
to be journalists now? I mean, are there not top managers in news 
organizations who were in anti-Vietnam protests in the ’60s, and their 
lives live on in Instagram?</p>
<p>Or is this specific to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Which, as 
you noted, the coverage is shifted the very week that Emily got caught 
up in this. You had the bombing of the AP bureau in Gaza. You had a very
 visceral reaction by the American public to the Israeli attacks in 
Gaza, in a way that you did not have in 2014 when 2,200 Palestinians 
were killed. You didn’t see this kind of reaction. You had, on the A1 of
 The New York Times on Sunday, a story about the brutality of life under
 Israeli occupation. These are all very unusual. Look on The New York 
Times today in terms of a letter from Gaza that really calls into 
question a lot of the Israeli narrative about Hamas and what’s really 
happening in Gaza. I mean, there’s just — there’s a major shift going 
on.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I think that Emily, in a way, the reason that she’s
 seeing a lot of support is — I was worried. I wanted to make sure she 
had support. And you’re seeing that because it’s coming at that moment. 
Thank God, because I can’t tell you again how distressing this has been 
for me as her instructor and someone who cares so deeply about her.</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: A major —</p>
<p><span>JUAN</span> GONZÁLEZ: And, Emily —</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: Go ahead, Juan.</p>
<p><span>JUAN</span> GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, Emily, I wanted to ask you: How has
 this, the last few days, shaped your view of journalism and what you 
want to do as a journalist?</p>
<p><span>EMILY</span> <span>WILDER</span>: Yeah, it’s really rocked my 
perspective, honestly, I mean, obviously. You know, I wanted to join the
 AP because — while, like everybody on this Earth, I do have opinions, 
and those opinions fuel my passion for journalism, I wanted to join the 
AP because I am capable at doing fact-based accountability journalism. 
That is what I really excelled at at The Arizona Republic, and that’s 
why the AP hired me. And they were aware that I cared about the world. 
They were aware that I had a commitment to justice and marginalized 
communities. So, I thought I would be welcome in a newsroom like AP.</p>
<p>But, you know, I was also aware of this broader history, that I’m 
just one example in, of media institutions unfairly applying these rules
 about objectivity and social media haphazardly, when expedient, in a 
way that generally comes down hardest on journalists of color, 
journalists who have ever spoken out on Israeli policy, and in a way 
that just reinforces status quo politics. So I was aware of that, and I 
was witnessing these shifts in the industry. I thought I’d be welcome.</p>
<p>But now I know that I — this experience, I guess, could have made me 
question my commitment to those values that compel me to do journalism, 
but I will not yield them. And now I know that I need to channel them 
into journalism in a team, in an organization, that is similarly 
aligned.</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: It’s interesting, when you 
follow the money, as journalists are supposed to do. The Stanford 
Review, a conservative publication, was co-founded over 30 years ago by 
the venture capitalist and conservative philanthropist Peter Thiel, who 
went on to speak at Trump’s first Republican National Convention. He 
didn’t contribute a lot to Republican senators, but he did contribute to
 the one who attacked you, Emily, and that was Arkansas Republican 
Senator Tom Cotton, and also has a lot of ties to the Stanford College 
Republicans.</p>
<p>But I also wanted to thank you for a <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2020/07/10/maryvale-family-blames-gov-ducey-fathers-death-covid-19/5395440002/">piece</a>
 that you did in The Arizona Republic that Juan and I followed up on, 
that you broke for them, which became a major national story. And that’s
 the story of Kristin Urquiza, whose father, Mark Anthony Urquiza, was a
 supporter of Donald Trump and died after believing the president’s 
assurances that the coronavirus pandemic was under control. He died of <span>COVID</span>. In October, we <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2020/10/6/kristin_urquiza_father_trump_coronavirus">spoke</a>
 to Kristin Urquiza, after you highlighted her in your piece in The 
Arizona Republic about losing her father. And I just want to play that 
clip for you.</p>
<p><span>KRISTIN</span> <span>URQUIZA</span>: My dad, first and 
foremost, was great and did not deserve to die alone in a hospital with 
just a nurse holding his hand. He was also a lifelong Republican who was
 politically aware. He watched television news programming fairly 
regularly, read the newspaper, and engaged me as a young kid in 
politics, which is kind of where I got my interest in the world around 
me from. He was a Trump supporter and voted for Trump and believed him 
in what he had to say.</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: So, that’s Kristin Urquiza 
talking about losing her father. But, you know, you had major impact as a
 young reporter at The Arizona Republic. And if also you could go back 
to commenting on Peter Thiel?</p>
<p><span>EMILY</span> <span>WILDER</span>: Yeah, that story was really 
formative in my time at The Arizona Republic. It was pretty early on in 
my time at the Republic. And it represents exactly the kind of 
journalism that I excel at and that I want to continue doing, which is 
highlighting the undertold, underrepresented or suppressed stories of 
certain communities and linking those experiences to a larger 
investigative context, to a larger — to the situation that we’re in, 
where communities of color are the most at risk for <span>COVID</span>-19.
 So, I was really grateful to have been a part of that and to have 
broken such an important story. And, you know, that’s what I — I try to 
continue to do impactful storytelling like that.</p>
<p>And in terms of the connection with Peter Thiel, yes, this 
organization does have powerful and wealthy connections in the 
conservative ecosystem. But I also want to make sure that people 
understand that this is just a group of college-aged trolls, honestly, 
and they did not have to become relevant. They should not have — the 
Associated Press should not have felt threatened by them. I truly 
believe they would have gone away — they would have spun their wheels on
 this and gone away, if the Associated Press had not fired me and had 
not sort of empowered them and empowered their bullying, empowered their
 disinformation.</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: And finally, Professor Janine 
Zacharia, what are you going to teach your students, as they come back 
to Stanford now, about what this means for journalism? In the end, 
because of Emily’s outspokenness and bravery in taking this on instead 
of slinking away, do you think journalism will advance in this country, 
and particularly around the Israel-Palestine issue?</p>
<p><span>JANINE</span> <span>ZACHARIA</span>: Well, I scrapped my class 
in foreign correspondence on Thursday that I had planned, and we’re 
devoting it to this, because it’s so important, obviously. Emily is a 
peer and a friend of many of the students in my current class, who have 
been very traumatized by this whole thing, wondering, again, you know, 
whether they have a future in journalism, reaching out to me quite 
shell-shocked. And so, I feel the need as their instructor to talk about
 what’s happened.</p>
<p>But I don’t know what to say, you know, truthfully, Amy, because what
 I do, as someone who started at Reuters and worked at The Washington 
Post, the conventional media, you know, what I train them to do, I don’t
 know — I just don’t know what to say right now. I’m still processing it
 all. But what I will do is hold up Emily as an example of what I 
believe they all should do, is use their brilliance and channel their 
convictions into amazing reporting that gets picked up by Amy Goodman 
and others. She had another story, by the way, about wait times for <span>COVID</span>
 testing, that was featured on Rachel Maddow, as an intern. Right? So, 
in the end, you know, I’ll stress that this is really the AP’s loss, and
 whoever hires her next is going to be so very fortunate.</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: Maybe she’ll be Sally Buzbee’s first hire at Washington Post —</p>
<p><span>JANINE</span> <span>ZACHARIA</span>: That would be nice.</p>
<p><span>AMY</span> <span>GOODMAN</span>: — and then follow in your 
footsteps. Emily — I want to thank you both for being with us, Emily 
Wilder, fired by AP, which has fired up the journalism community, not 
only in the United States, and others for more just reporting around the
 world, and Janine Zacharia, Emily Wilder’s journalism professor at 
Stanford University who is the former Washington Post Jerusalem bureau 
chief.</p>
