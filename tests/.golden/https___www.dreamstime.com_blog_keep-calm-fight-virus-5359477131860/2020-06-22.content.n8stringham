<p>Dear Dreamstimers,</p>
<p>2020 has presented us with a unique challenge, which few of us can 
compare to previous experiences. The global extension of Covid-19 seems 
to underscore how one virus can contaminate countries and continents 
based solely on our social organisms and connections. But while it may 
seem, these days, that our weakness is in our numbers, we know that to 
be false.</p>
<p>We are and will continue to be, stronger together. It is also 
together that we will overcome this crisis, and learn how to better care
 for ourselves and those near us.</p>
<p>We each have a distinct and important role to play these days and we 
know you, our community, are graphic, video, written and social 
communicators. That is why your impact can be extraordinary and your 
contribution hugely positive.</p>
<p>It’s not only essential to wash our hands, but it’s also vital to 
communicate kindly and accurately. Here's how we can make the world a 
calmer place.</p>
<p>Relay timely information</p>
<p>Timelines are important, especially in a context like ours. As events
 are unfolding day by day, hour by hour, it’s vital that everybody knows
 the correct date for any &amp; all information. This helps us all keep 
an accurate track of what’s changing and what our “now” is like.</p>
<p>This isn’t a good time to recycle outdated content and present it as current information.</p>
<p>Present trustworthy information</p>
<p>We’re all specialized in a particular craft or business, but we’re 
not all specialists. When it comes to guiding and saving lives, advice 
should come from experts - exactly as it was shared by them. Too many 
opinions and biases can not only clutter a fast-moving environment, they
 can also trigger effects that you may never anticipate.</p>
<p>Mental fortitude is as important and as vulnerable as physical 
fortitude right now. Help your audience with facts from reputable 
sources and name your sources. One vetted source is <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries" rel="nofollow"> Worldometers</a></p>
<p>Help your government and local authorities broadcast official information</p>
<p>Each country is facing different circumstances and challenges. Each 
nation needs guidance and assurance now. Use your communication skills 
for the greater good and resort to governmental sources for public 
health announcements and recommended actions.</p>
<p>Your greatest help now, reaching thousands and millions of people 
around the world, can be to make official information user-friendly and 
compelling for everybody in the room.</p>
<p>You can do that by using clear, informative graphics and turning stats into actionable bits of wisdom.</p>
<p>Say no to fake news</p>
<p>Fake news is the covid-19 of our global conversations. It’s weakening
 our faith, our trust in those who can actually bring positive change, 
and ultimately isolating us on conflicting sides. More than ever, we 
need a common and factual ground.</p>
<p>Fight for your right and our right to honest information and guides.</p>
<p>Keep calm and keep your audience calm too</p>
<p>Uncertainty is something we will probably never get used to. An 
overflow of exaggerated headlines or graphics, severely pessimistic 
infographics or content that’s screaming instead of discussing can 
double the negative effects of our actual problems.</p>
<p>Each of us is a broadcaster in our family, group of friends or 
neighbors. We all impact the noise and it’s only up to us to make that 
impact a good one. Choose your words, your photographs, illustrations or
 graphics wisely and think about how you want your readers to feel. Be 
responsible, be positive, be an active part of the solutions we all need
 right now.</p>
<p>Covid-19 continues to ravage nations and to dramatically change our 
way of life and our self-reliance. Countries like China and Italy are 
examples of the extent to which this virus can impact our daily lives. 
It takes a common effort to prevent and heal the body, the mind, and the
 spirit of an entire world.</p>
<p>Join us in honest, positive communications with the world and let’s start dreaming again soon.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Team Dreamstime</p>

Positive information will help all, in this time of world crisis. 
Negative info. will do more harm, and no good at all.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">In the past two days, all I've been receiving on my
 social media accounts, are alarming news about the Covid pandemic. The 
clutter has gotten to such an extent that my family members have begun 
becoming paranoid about the entire situation. We have taken precautions,
 have stopped visiting the outside, and are obeying a strict lockdown - 
yet, a level of apprehension still manifests ("What will happen to my 
family?" "Am I possibly infested?" "What will become of my family after I
 pass?")Simply put, If you have taken the required precautions, you 
would most likely be fine. If you have the coronavirus, panicking wont 
help. One must maintain a sense of levelheadedness through all of this 
no matter what. </p>

<p class="rm-manual">Your appeal to "keep calm" really hits it home for 
me. People have started panic buying and fighting each other for basic 
necessities during this coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic - makes me long 
for a time when things were normal. A part of me wonders if this is the 
new normal!~Sanjeev Nanda</p>

in Europe are badly affected. And it gets worser day by day. So it's 
necessary to pay attention to everybody and follow the instructions. So 
Dreamstimer, take good care of yourselves!</p>

<p class="rm-manual">As we know, Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, 
according to the WHO (as of this writing), globally, has claimed more 
than 8000 people - a shroud of doubt has thus appeared over the medical 
infrastructure of major developed countries of the world! Indian 
Pharmaceutical Industry, one of the biggest in the field, has also 
braced for a deadlier impact in the weeks to come. According to 
statistics provided by The Wall Street Journal, a major publication, 
based in the US, the world has almost 3 months of stocked medicines and 
API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) to run on. Many industry 
leaders, like Sanjeev Nanda, and his Pharmaceutical enterprises, based 
in Russia, Singapore, and the UAE, are projected to show a sharp decline
 in medical output, within the first two months.Market Indicators, such 
as the DOW, NIFTY, etc. suggest that the global Pharma industry is 
steadily developing cold feet under the threat of the novel coronavirus.
 Quoting ISHVAN Pharmaceuticals CEO, Sanjeev Nanda - "Things would get 
bad, before they turn any good."</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Thanks for some great, common sense tips in this 
time. To put a light note on things: as photographers, at least during 
our time at home we can catch up on editing and posting photos from the 
last several months that have piled up. Or, we can concentrate on 
shooting the plants and animals in our own backyard. Take up 
macrophotography during this time at home. And pray for others. William </p>
