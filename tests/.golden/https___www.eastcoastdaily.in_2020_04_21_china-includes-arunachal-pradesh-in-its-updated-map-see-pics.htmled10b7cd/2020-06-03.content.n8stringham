<h1 class="rm-manual">China includes Arunachal Pradesh in its updated map ; See Pics</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><span> <span>Apr 21, 2020, 02:21 pm IST</span></span></p>
<p>China has included parts of Arunachal Pradesh within its 
international boundaries, an updated version issued by Sky Map has 
revealed.</p>
<p>Sky Map, China”s authority on digital maps, is constructed and 
operated by a unit directly under Beijing”s National Surveying and 
Mapping Geographic Information Bureau. Recently, Sky Map users 
discovered that it has updated the country”s map with the latest 
national borders, including India”s Arunachal Pradesh, a DW media report
 said.</p>
<p>Arunachal Pradesh, a hill state in the Northeast bordering Tibet, was
 part of British India in 1913-14 and formally included in India when 
the McMohan Line was established as the border between India and Tibet 
in 1938.</p>
<p>China continues to consider Arunachal Pradesh a part of Tibet, which it occupied in 1951.</p>
<p>The map of China, until now, is based on the 1989 edition of the Sky 
Map of its national borders. Though since then, China has successively 
solved its border issues with Russia and Central Asian countries, but 
none of them have been reflected in the map.</p>
<p>However, as per a DW news report in Chinese, some users noticed that 
Sky Map has now updated the geographic information at the “county” 
level. “The county boundaries of some counties clearly transcend the red
 colour marked 1989 edition of the national border, especially in Tibet 
area bordering Bhutan and India,” the report said.</p>
<p>China has claimed its sovereignty over Tibet “counties bordering 
India and Bhutan from east to west — “Chayu county, Medog county of 
Linzhi city, Cuona county, Luoza county of Shannan city, Kangma county, 
Yadong county of Xigaze city”.</p>
<p>Chayu, Medog, and Cuona counties are divided by the McMahon Line with
 the northern parts in China and the southern parts in India. “Longzi 
County in Shannan City does not theoretically border India, but the 
McMahon Line runs through the county from southwest to northeast, with 
Chinese control in the west and Indian control in the east.”</p>
<p>However, China calls Indian area and part of Chayu county, Motuo 
county of Nyingchi city and Longzi county and Cuona county of Shannan 
City, “South Tibet”.</p>
<p>As per the updated Sky Map, “the southern boundary of Chayu county is
 roughly the same as the boundary in 1989, the southern part of Motuo 
county has contracted northward, and the southern boundary of Cuona 
county also roughly coincides with the boundary in 1989. The Longzi 
county does not border India at all, as Beijing advocates. Cuona county 
of Shannan city not only borders with India but also borders with 
Bhutan.”</p>
<p>“China-Bhutan border dispute area, Mulasading, is located in Cuona 
County-south of the McMahon Line. Mulasading originally belonged to 
Tibet and was managed by the Tawang Temple. In 1949, India and Bhutan 
signed the Permanent Peace and Friendship Agreement to transfer 
Mulasading to Bhutan. In the latest Sky Map, the border of Cuona County 
in the Mulasading region is south of the 1989 edition of the national 
border.”</p>
<p>“In addition to Tibet, the borders of Tashkurgan County in the 
Kashgar region of Xinjiang have also changed. The northwestern part of 
the border is more than the 1989 edition. According to the 2011 border 
agreement between China and Tajikistan, this extra part is 1,158 square 
kilometers east of the Sarekole Mountains,” the report said.</p>
