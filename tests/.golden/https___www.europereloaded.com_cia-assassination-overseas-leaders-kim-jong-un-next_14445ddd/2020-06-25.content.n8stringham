<h2 class="rm-manual">CIA and the Assassination of Leaders Overseas</h2>
<h3 class="rm-manual">VLADIMIR PLATOV</h3>
<p>The history of the US Central Intelligence Agency is replete with 
numerous examples of political assassinations, not only in the US, but 
also of leaders of countries Washington disagrees with. So today, the 
CIA has actively begun developing various methods for the deliberate 
elimination of the US’s newest political opponent, North Korean leader 
Kim Jong-un, involving not only special forces in this task, but also 
the special services of countries that cooperate closely with the CIA.</p>
<p>Evidence of this, in particular, can be found in the $310,000 of the 
country’s defense budget for 2018, officially laid out by the South 
Korean government – the cost of eliminating North Korea’s leader Kim 
Jong-un. These funds will be spent on training and equipping a special 
“decapitation unit” dedicated to the North Korean leadership, the 
creation of which became known on December 1. The squad will include 
about one thousand commandos, whose task in the event of a war will be 
to find and kill Kim Jong-un and other top leaders of the neighboring 
state. As a source in the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea 
told the newspaper Korea Herald, the squad’s special equipment will 
include drones, suicide bombers, reconnaissance drones and even heavy 
grenade launchers. The structure and training plans of the squad are 
classified, but according to the information of the South Korean media, 
the soldiers of the new squad will train according to methodology used 
by the US special purpose team SEAL Team Six, which assassinated Osama 
bin Laden.</p>
<p>At the same time, it should be remembered that an attempt to create a
 special squad in South Korea in 1968 with similar goals ended in 
tragedy. At the time, 31 South Korean criminals were promised a pardon 
if the squad they formed killed Kim Il-sung. The group underwent 
intensive training, during which three people were killed, and in the 
end they were sent on rubber boats to the DPRK, but halfway were 
recalled. The prisoners were not released, the exhausting training 
continued, and the date of the new operation was set. In 1971, members 
of the squad rebelled, killed their instructors, tried to get to Seoul 
and, when they were blocked by the army, blew themselves up with 
grenades. The four survivors were later executed. In 2003 the South 
Korean film “Silmido” was made about this tragic episode.</p>
<p>Such radical plans to get rid of political opponents are hardly 
surprising, especially when these plans are developed and supervised by 
the CIA, which is adept in these matters. And it’s no wonder that even 
the director of the US Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo 
(pictured), spoke in October at the Foundation for Defense of 
Democracies forum in Washington, saying that if the CIA liquidates the 
leader of the DPRK, Kim Jong-un, he would not acknowledge involvement of
 American agents in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kim-jong-un-north-korean-leader-dies-not-going-talk-cia-director-mike-pompeo-a8012721.html">assassination</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that in order to maintain their dominance, the US 
stops at nothing, including the murders of undesirables. During the 50s 
and 60s, they killed the largest number of foreign leaders and public 
figures who were fighting not for communism, but for their countries’ 
national independence. Then came a certain lull, connected both with the
 policy of “détente” and with scandalous exposures of the CIA’s 
activities by the Senate Commission of F. Church in 1975. The 
committee’s conclusions about the illegal activities of American 
intelligence services (in particular, evidence of murders and numerous 
attempts on the lives of foreign statesmen) led to the adoption by US 
President G. Ford of an order banning “officially sanctioned” murders of
 foreign leaders. However, in 1981 this presidential decree was 
overturned by Reagan, and the list of victims began to grow rapidly once
 again.</p>
<p>After numerous media discussions, longstanding interest is not 
letting up in the secret of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez’s 
fast-developing infection and subsequent death with a new form of 
biological weapon: a cancer virus and the American special services’ 
involvement in this.</p>
<p>However, another highly strange and inexplicable fact (other than the
 special operation of the US special services) is that, besides Hugo 
Chavez, a number of other Latin American leaders, clearly disliked by 
Washington, “unexpectedly” fell ill with cancer all at the same time. 
Among them were Argentine President Nestor Kirchner (succeeded by 
Christine Kirchner), Brazilian President I. Lula da Silva (after whom 
Dilma Roussef came to power), and Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo 
(who was overthrown during the CIA’s coup d’état in 2012; shortly 
thereafter he was diagnosed with cancer). It is also curious that after 
the conservative and pro-American president of Colombia, Juan Manuel 
Santos began peace talks with the partisans of the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia (FARC), he also “unexpectedly” contracted cancer.</p>
<p>Venezuelan writer Luis Brito Garcia counted more than 900 attempts on
 the life of Cuban leader Fidel Castro organized by the CIA. And in the 
last years of his life, Castro also suffered a mysterious oncological 
bowel disease, which struck him after the 2006 “People’s Summit” in the 
Argentine city of Cordoba.</p>
<p>We also recall the very strange death of former Palestinian President (PLO) Yasser Arafat, who suffered … leukemia in 2004.</p>
<p>It is also not unreasonable to cite WikiLeaks’ revelations that in 
2008 the CIA asked its embassy in Paraguay to collect biometric data, 
including DNA, of all four presidential candidates. With knowledge of a 
person’s DNA code, it is easy to develop an oncogene for each 
individual. And if we assume that such data were obtained on the eve of 
the elections in Brazil, then Dilma Roussef’s cancer, contracted in 
2009, fits perfectly into this theory.</p>
<p>So, in addition to forceful options for eliminating political 
opponents (as, in particular, happened with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 
or Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi), it is unlikely that the CIA would be 
above infecting them with cancer viruses. Moreover, similar experiments 
have been conducted for a long time in the secret laboratories of the 
CIA, where they became a “military trophy of the American special 
services” based on the brutal concentration camp human experimentation 
of Josef Mengele, and before that “on the experience” of the American, 
Cornelius “Doctor Death” Rhoads. This pathologist from the Rockefeller 
Institute of Medical Research started work in Puerto Rico and became a 
“pioneer” in virtually all areas of the creation of new technologies for
 killing people, from chemical and biological methods to radiation. With
 funding from the Rockefeller Institute, he conducted experiments in 
Puerto Rico in the early 30s infecting people with cancer cells, which 
work was conducted inside a secret “Building No. 439″.</p>
<p>Is cancer the effect of a new weapon of the American intelligence 
agencies, fitting in well with the “modus vivendi” of the agonizing 
North American empire? We note only that the disease affected only those
 politicians whose political direction was contrary to the dominant 
position of the United States.</p>
<p>The US is on the edge of economic collapse and remains afloat only 
because it can launch a printing press to re-credit its economy, 
constantly growing its military budget and secret CIA operations. 
Therefore, it is entirely logical to assume that “the craftsmen of 
Langley” found new quick and inexpensive methods of effectively 
eliminating opponents. The most important advantage of these methods is 
that they leave no traces, are disguised as cancer or a heart attack, 
and eliminate the possibility of exposure and direct liability.</p>
