<p>Being the trendy, social media maven that I am (sarcasm definitely 
intended), Iâ€™ve gotten up and running on Tik Tok. Besides being a 
wonderful way to give Donald Trump the finger in 2020 â€“ it has been 
really fun to see how creative a lot of people around the world can be.</p>
<p>And then there are all the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sweet_margs/video/6952185318623808774?sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6952230111199643142&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;is_copy_url=0">really cute women and their sexual innuendos.</a> ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>There is also on the platform, some excellent spoken political 
commentary â€“ which is a feat unto itself when you consider the average 
TikTok poster has only about 90 seconds to get a point across.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some people manage to get the job done. Like this guy 
pointing out the Hegelian Hell, our Boomer and Gen X selfish pigs are 
leaving for the younger generation.</p>

<p>Pretty much sums it up.</p>
<p>Our systems and institutions punch us down, instead of lifting us up. <a href="https://eand.co/when-were-vulnerable-we-need-support-our-systems-exploit-us-instead-659fe020a857">Why is it </a>that the average American lives <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjPk-Hm0IPwAhX3EFkFHV9dBmoQFjAAegQIAhAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2020%2F12%2F11%2Fmajority-of-americans-are-living-paycheck-to-paycheck-since-covid-hit.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw0XulSYrV_5FbK9WaWj3bVs">paycheck to paycheck now</a>
 â€” and has precisely zero chance of moving up the socioeconomic ladder, 
but an almost sure chance of moving down it? Think about what the above 
really means. It isnâ€™t just that Americans pay too much for basic 
things, so much that theyâ€™re left indebted and weary and powerless. Itâ€™s
 that thereâ€™s a very specific pattern to the way that Americans are 
exploited by their systems and institutions. They are punched down, over
 and over again, at the precise moments they have already been knocked 
down â€” and need someone to help lift them back up. Is it any wonder 
thereâ€™s no upward mobility, soaring depression, a sense of fatalism and 
futility, falling living standards, and an imploded middle, when 
everybodyâ€™s being punched down, at the critical turning points they need
 lifting up?</p>
<p>A good question â€“ one that a fair number of Americans donâ€™t want to answer. </p>
