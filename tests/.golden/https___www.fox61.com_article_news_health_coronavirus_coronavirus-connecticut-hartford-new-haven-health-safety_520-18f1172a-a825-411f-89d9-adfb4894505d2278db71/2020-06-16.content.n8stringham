that can remain open, such as healthcare, food, financial industries, 
public transportation and childcare services.</p>
<p>Others will have to close by 8 p.m. Sunday.</p>
<p>The governor is calling this his “Stay Safe, Stay Home” initiative. The plan recommends that state residents do the following:</p>
<p>1. Effective at 8PM on Sunday, March 23, all non-essential businesses statewide should close;</p>
<p>2. Non-essential public community gatherings of individuals of any 
size for any reason should be canceled (e.g. parties, celebrations or 
other social events) are canceled or postponed at this time;</p>
<p>3. If you must leave your home, do not travel in groups - groups must be limited to workers providing essential services;</p>
<p>4. Everyone should keep at least six feet away from each other whenever possible;</p>
<p>5. Businesses and entities that provide other essential services 
should implement rules that help facilitate social distancing of at 
least six feet;</p>
<p>6. Individuals should limit outdoor recreational activities to 
non-contact and avoid activities where they come in close contact with 
other people;</p>
<p>7. Individuals should limit use of public transportation to when 
absolutely necessary and should limit potential exposure by spacing out 
at least six feet from other riders;</p>
<p>8. Sick individuals should not leave their home except to fill 
critical needs or to receive medical care, and only after a telehealth 
visit to determine if leaving the home is in the best interest of their 
health;</p>
<p>9. Young people should also practice social distancing and avoid contact with vulnerable populations; and</p>
<p>10. Use precautionary sanitizer practices such as using soap and 
water, hand sanitizer, or isopropyl alcohol wipes. Washing hands with 
soap and water for at least 20 seconds works best.</p>

<p>"The officers were on personal leave and traveled to Spain, which was
 not on the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) list of countries with a
 coronavirus advisory at that time. Despite the fact that Spain was 
still not included in CDC advisories at the time of their return, the 
City of Hartford and the Hartford Police Department asked those officers
 not to return to work for a fourteen-day period. A fifth officer was in
 contact off-duty with one of the officers prior to receiving the test 
results, and that officer is now at home and will be tested. At this 
point, none appear to have significant symptoms and are self-isolated at
 home."</p>
<p>City officials are also working to provide shelter for the homeless population who may need to be isolated. </p>

<ul>
<li>CEO Of UConn Health Andrew Agwunob said: "It's not just about testing today, but also research tomorrow (regarding COVID-19)."</li>
<li>The partnership between UConn Health, Hartford Healthcare, and 
Jackson Laboratories should be able to provide a new ability to test 150
 tests a day. The capacity for testing by Jackson Labs is expected to 
increase in a short time as more employees are hired and equipment is 
sent in. </li>
<li>Jackson Labs say they are also developing mice to send to other 
medical science labs to test for vaccines and medications for therapies.
 </li>
<li>It was stated the more people stay home, practice social distancing,
 the easier a time it will be for medical professionals and labs to ramp
 up their medical supplies and testing capabilities. </li>

online course delivery for classes held at the Storrs campus, regional 
campuses and the School of Law. It is expected that this will remain the
 case until at least Monday, April 6. If this is extended, the 
university will communicate that well in advance. All faculty need to 
provide this option to their students. No faculty members should cancel 
their courses. Students will be graded and given credit as they normally
 would. The provost and deans will work with their faculty to develop 
individualized accommodation plans for courses such as labs, law 
clinics, internships and clinical placements that are not amenable to 
online delivery.</li>
<li> <span>UConn</span> Health will issue separate guidance to its students, faculty and staff by close of business Thursday, March 12.</li>
<li>All students who are able to remain at home or elsewhere following 
spring break should do so. For those residential students who will 
remain at <span>UConn</span> during spring break or have no alternative 
but to return to campus following spring break, Student 
Affairs/Residential Life will work directly with them to assess needs 
and ensure accommodation. The Rec Center will be closed, as will other 
facilities. A dining facility and other essential services will remain 
open.</li>
<li> Effective Saturday, March 14, employees on the Storrs campus, 
regional campuses, and law school who are able to telecommute should 
plan to work from home, with the approval of their supervisor, until at 
least Monday, April 6. Employees must speak to their supervisors in 
advance to confirm they both agree that the employee is able to 
telecommute. Further guidance will be provided within the next 24 hours.
 Employees who cannot telecommute should report to work as scheduled.</li>
<li> Also effective Saturday, March 14, no events larger than 100 people
 will be permitted on any campus. This includes all events, meetings and
 performances, which should be canceled or postponed if they involve 
more than 100 people. Extension faculty who work regularly with groups 
of people throughout the state on programming may continue to do so, 
provided the group is fewer than 100 people. </li>
<li> With respect to intercollege athletics, competitions may continue. 
However, spectators will not be permitted to attend, per guidance from 
the NCAA, including for tournament games.</li>

<p>Mayor Ganim announces all city senior centers to close out of 
abundance of caution to protect Bridgeport’s most vulnerable population </p>
<p>Mayor Ganim announced today that all city Senior Centers will close 
until further notice out of an abundance of caution to prevent seniors 
and our older population from contracting and suffering severe effects 
of the Coronavirus. After careful assessment of the present situation 
regarding COVID-19, effective tomorrow, Thursday, March 12, 2020, all 
City of Bridgeport Senior Centers will be closed until further notice. 
This decision to close the centers was made after diligent consideration
 of our most vulnerable populations being in the category of higher 
risk. Early data suggests older people are more likely to contract 
COVID-19 due to lower immune systems and they are more likely to have 
underlying health conditions. <a href="https://www.bridgeportct.gov/coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer">More &gt;&gt;</a></p>
