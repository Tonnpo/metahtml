<h4 class="rm-manual"><a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/6136348167001">Sen. Barrasso on preventing a coronavirus pandemic</a></h4>
<p>Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso weighs in on Democratic criticism of Trump's coronavirus response.</p>
<p>A woman in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/japan">Japan</a> tested positive for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus">coronavirus</a> for the second time on Wednesday, as the country grips with 190 cases separate from the Diamond Princess <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/cruises">cruise ship</a> outbreak, according to multiple reports.</p>
<p>The tour bus guide in her 40s first tested positive in late January 
and was released from the hospital after recovering. She was readmitted 
after having a sore throat and chest pains, according to the local 
government.</p>
<p>It's a first known case of a second positive test in Japan, which 
prompted Health Minister Katsunobu Kato to inform Japan's central 
government of the need to review previous patient lists and monitor the 
condition of those previously discharged, according to Reuters.</p>

<p>“Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant and with 
minimal symptoms, and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its 
way into the lungs,” said Philip Tierno Jr., professor of microbiology 
and pathology at NYU School of Medicine, according to the news 
organization.</p>
<p>The virus can reportedly spread without symptoms showing up, which 
forces officials to play catch up and makes it far more difficult to 
manage.</p>
<p>Health officials analyzed the implications of a patient testing 
positive after having an initial recovery. Second positive tests have 
been reported in China.</p>
<p>“I’m not certain that this is not bi-phasic, like anthrax,” Tierno 
Jr. said in regards to the disease being able to go away before 
reappearing.</p>

<p>With the 2020 Summer Olympic games scheduled in July, Toyko has urged
 large gatherings of people to be stopped or limited over the next two 
weeks to contain the virus, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-japan/japan-coronavirus-clouds-gather-as-woman-tests-positive-for-second-time-idUSKCN20L0BI">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>“The Olympics should be postponed if this continues ... There are 
many people who don’t understand how easy it is to spread this infection
 from one person to another," Tierno Jr. said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-japan/japan-pm-abe-says-to-ask-all-schools-to-close-for-most-of-march-idUSKCN20L161">announced</a> on Thursday the government would close all schools for a month to help contain the virus.</p>

<p>Another death was also reported in northern Hokkaido, which brings 
the total killed by the virus in Japan to eight. Four have died from the
 cruise ship, which has roughly 704 cases.</p>
