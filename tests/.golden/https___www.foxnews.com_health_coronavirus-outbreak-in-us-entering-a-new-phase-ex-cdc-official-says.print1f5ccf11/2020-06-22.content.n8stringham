<h1 class="rm-manual">Coronavirus outbreak in US 'entering a new phase,' ex-CDC official says</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">By Alexandria Hein</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus">novel coronavirus</a>
 has spread to at least 34 states in the U.S. and Washington, D.C., and 
each official who has confirmed cases in their home state has warned 
that more illnesses are likely to come, especially as more test kits are
 made available.</p>
<p>“The outbreak is entering a new phase, from mostly travel-related 
cases to domestic transmission,” Dr. Robert Amler, dean of the School of
 Health Sciences and Practice at New York Medical College and former 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) chief medical officer, 
told Fox News. “This puts our preventative measures to the test – how 
good a job can every one of us do to minimize the spread of the virus?”</p>

<p>On Monday, the CDC said none of its employees had tested positive for
 COVID-19, but discussed a series of guidelines for those who are 
considered to be most vulnerable to the virus, including the elderly and
 those with weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>Dr. Nancy Messonnier, CDC director of the center for the National 
Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the guidelines 
include avoiding large gatherings, staying close to home, and 
stockpiling medications and groceries. In addition, caregivers should 
devise a plan for how to provide care for patients should they contract 
the illness.</p>
<p>“As the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the U.S.
 will at some point in time this year or next be exposed to the virus, 
and there’s a good chance many will become sick,” Messonnier said.</p>

<p>She also asked for people to understand the need for “personal 
responsibilities” to protect those who are older and considered at risk 
for complications and to listen to local government officials regarding 
event cancellations and other guidance.</p>
<p>“We’re looking both at risk of exposure and risk of the individuals,” she said.</p>
<p>Some of those responsibilities include using good personal judgment before traveling.</p>

<p>“Domestic travelers should use good judgment,” Amler said, 
“considering the importance of the trip and the expected level of virus 
activity at the destination.”</p>
<p class="">As far as mass transit goes, Amler said the risk of boarding
 buses and trains each day is “not well characterized” yet, but for 
riders and those who must continue commuting, “the basic rules always 
apply – social distancing and avoidance of contact with people who are 
coughing, sneezing, etc.”</p>
