<h4><a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/6006625869001">White House outlines four goals in talks with North Korea's Kim Jong Un</a></h4>
<p>Only eight months after the first <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/us-north-korea-summit">U.S.-North Korea summit</a>, President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">Trump</a> and North Korean leader <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kim-jong-un">Kim Jong Un</a> met again on Wednesday in Vietnam but walked away from negotiations about 24 hours later.</p>
<p class="">A lunch and signing ceremony that had been scheduled for 
Thursday was canceled and Trump departed for Washington several hours 
ahead of schedule. Trump remained non-committal about a third summit.</p>
<p class=""><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-to-meet-with-north-koreas-kim-jong-for-social-dinner">TRUMP SHAKES HANDS WITH NORTH KOREA'S KIM JONG UN AT START OF HANOI SUMMIT</a> </p>
<p>Read on to see what happened in Vietnam and how the relationship 
between Trump and Kim has evolved since their historic meeting in June.</p>
<h3>Feb. 27: No deal</h3>
<p>Trump told reporters he was unable to reach a deal with North Korea 
because Kim wanted U.S. sanctions to be completely removed before he 
promised to shut down North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility.</p>
<p>“It was about the sanctions,” Trump said. “Basically, they wanted the
 sanctions lifted in their entirety, and we couldn’t do that. They were 
willing to denuke a large portion of the areas that we wanted, but we 
couldn’t give up all of the sanctions for that.”</p>
<p>Despite the lack of progress, the president said he trusted Kim's 
promise he would not resume nuclear and missile testing, but that the 
current U.S. sanctions would stay in place.</p>
<h3>Feb. 26: Meeting again</h3>
<p>Trump and Kim shake hands at the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi in Vietnam ahead of their second summit.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to be with Chairman Kim," Trump said at the time. "I 
thought the first summit was a great success and I think this one, 
hopefully, will be equal or greater than the first."</p>
<h3>Feb. 8, 2019: Trump tweets details about the summit</h3>
<p>After aides met in North Korea to discuss a second summit, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094031561861881856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-confirms-details-of-second-summit-with-north-korea-touting-its-potential-as-economic-powerhouse">Trump tweeted</a> to confirm that it would be happening on Feb. 27 and 28 in Hanoi.</p>
<p>He tweeted later that day that he is hopeful for North Korea’s success in the future.</p>
<p>“North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, will become a 
great Economic Powerhouse. He may surprise some but he won’t surprise 
me, because I have gotten to know him &amp; fully understand how capable
 he is. North Korea will become a different kind of Rocket - an Economic
 one!” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094035813820784640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-confirms-details-of-second-summit-with-north-korea-touting-its-potential-as-economic-powerhouse">he wrote</a>.</p>
<h3>Feb. 5, 2019: Trump announces second summit at State of the Union</h3>
<p>During his State of the Union address, Trump announced he and Kim 
would meet for a second summit at the end of February in Vietnam.</p>
<p>"As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-to-announce-new-kim-summit-during-state-of-the-union-address">he said</a>. "Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months."</p>

<p>North Korean envoy <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-to-meet-north-korean-official-in-the-oval-office-in-possible-prelude-to-2nd-nuclear-summit">Kim Yong Chol visited the Oval Office</a>
 on Jan. 18 for 90 minutes to discuss denuclearization and a second 
summit. He brought a letter from the North Korean leader to Trump.</p>
<p>The next day, Trump confirmed plans were underway for a second summit at the end of February.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korean-media-confirm-kim-jong-un-is-on-train-to-2nd-summit">NORTH KOREAN MEDIA CONFIRM KIM JONG UN IS ON TRAIN TO 2ND SUMMIT</a></p>
<p>Trump also responded to Kim’s letter, which North Korean media reported as a “good personal letter,” the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-to-announce-new-kim-summit-during-state-of-the-union-address">KCNA said</a>, according to Yonhap News.</p>
<p>“He spoke highly of President Trump for expressing his unusual 
determination and will for the settlement of the issue with a great 
interest in the second DPRK-U.S. summit,” the news outlet added.</p>
<h3>Jan. 1, 2019: Kim says he's willing to meet with Trump again</h3>
<p>In a New Year’s speech, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/kim-jong-un-says-hes-willing-to-meet-trump-at-any-time-in-new-years-message">Kim said he was prepared to meet with Trump</a>,
 though he threatened “an alternative course” if the U.S. "continues to 
break its promises and misjudges our patience by unilaterally demanding 
certain things and pushes ahead with sanctions and pressure."</p>
<h3>December 2018: Trump confirms a second summit</h3>
<p>As he returned to the U.S. from the G20 summit in Argentina in 
December, Trump told reporters there would be a second summit with North
 Korea by the end of January or February, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-northkorea/trump-says-next-meeting-with-north-koreas-kim-likely-in-early-2019-idUSKCN1O103Q">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p>“We're getting along very well," he reportedly said. "We have a good relationship with Kim."</p>
<p>Trump also said he planned to invite North Korea's leader to the U.S. at some point.</p>
<h3>Sept. 25, 2018: South Korean president meets with North Korean leaders to discuss a second summit</h3>
<p>South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with North Korean leaders in 
Pyongyang in September to discuss denuclearization and a second summit 
with Trump.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-could-meet-with-kim-jong-un-by-years-end-south-korean-president-tells-fox-news">He told Fox News’ Bret Baier</a> that he felt he had “ascertained Chairman Kim’s commitment to complete denuclearization.”</p>
<p>“If the United States could take corresponding measures, then I 
believe we will be able to expedite North Korea by further 
denuclearization measures,” Moon said.</p>

<p>At the time, Moon said he believed a second summit could happen by the end of 2018.</p>
<h3>Sept. 29, 2018: North Korean leaders say the country doesn’t trust the US</h3>
<p> When they met in June 2018, Kim and Trump signed a statement 
promising to work towards denuclearization, but without a specific plan.

<p>About three months after the first summit between Kim and Trump, 
North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho complained to the United 
Nations that the U.S. was not responding to North Korea’s “significant 
goodwill measures” to denuclearize the country, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-assembly-northkorea-idUSKCN1M90JF">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p>“Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our 
national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will 
unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” he told the U.N.</p>
<h3>June 12, 2018: First summit ends positively, but with few specific details</h3>
<p>Trump and Kim began their historic summit with a handshake on the morning of June 12, 2018, in Singapore.</p>
<p>After one-on-one talks, expanded discussions with their aides and a “working lunch,” <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/read-full-document-signed-donald-trump-kim-jong/story?id=55828930">the two world leaders signed a statement</a>
 promising to establish a better relationship between the two nations 
and work towards denuclearization - without any specifics about how 
denuclearization would be accomplished.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/north-korea-dragging-feet-on-pledge-to-turn-over-american-remains-as-2nd-summit-looms">NORTH KOREA DRAGGING FEET ON PLEDGE TO TURN OVER AMERICAN REMAINS, AS 2ND SUMMIT LOOMS</a></p>
<p>"We had a really fantastic meeting, a lot of progress, really very 
positive," Trump said. "I think better than anybody could have expected.
 Top of the line, really good. We’re going right now to a signing.”</p>
<h3>March 2018 - June 1, 2018: US and North Korean leaders go back and forth on meeting</h3>
<p>In the months leading up to the first summit between Trump and Kim, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-kim-summit-from-the-invitation-to-the-cancellation-a-timeline">the leaders continued to go back and forth on whether they would meet</a>.
 Though Trump accepted Kim’s invitation to meet in early March, the date
 and location of the meeting (June 12 in Singapore) weren’t set until 
May.</p>
<p>However, North Korean leaders threatened to cancel the talks midway through May and Trump himself said he would back out.</p>
<p>Leaders from both sides eventually said they would be willing to talk
 after South Korean president stepped in to talk with North Korean 
leaders and aides from both North Korea and the U.S. met in North Korea,
 Singapore and New York City to finalize details ahead of the actual 
summit.</p>
<p>The summit was officially confirmed again by Trump on June 1 after he
 received a personal letter from Kim, delivered by a North Korean 
official to the White House.</p>
