<p>“Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational Battle Station.” – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7-tskP0OzI">Emperor Palpatine, Return of the Jedi</a></p>
<p>Analysis: This week Microsoft took a series of dramatic steps against the recent <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-fireeye-confirm-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/">SolarWinds supply chain attack</a>.
 In the size, speed and scope of its actions, Microsoft has reminded the
 world that it can still muster firepower like no one else as a 
nearly-overwhelming force for good.</p>
<p>Through four steps over four days, Microsoft flexed the muscle of its
 legal team and its control of the Windows operating system to nearly 
obliterate the actions of some of the most sophisticated offensive 
hackers out there. In this case, the adversary is believed to be <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/">APT29</a>, aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozy_Bear">Cozy Bear</a>,
 the group many believe to be associated with Russian intelligence, and 
best known for carrying out the 2016 hack against the Democratic 
National Committee (DNC).</p>
<h4 class="rm-manual">FOLLOW-UP: <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/microsoft-says-internal-probe-finds-malicious-solarwinds-code-no-sign-impact-yet/">Microsoft says internal probe finds malicious SolarWinds code, no sign of further impact yet</a>
</h4>
<p>While details are continuing to emerge, the SolarWinds supply chain 
attack is already the most significant attack in recent memory. 
According to <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory">SolarWinds</a>, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/13/customers-protect-nation-state-cyberattacks/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/global-intrusion-campaign-leverages-software-supply-chain-compromise.html">FireEye</a>, and <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/">the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a>
 the attackers compromised a server used to build updates for the 
SolarWinds Orion Platform, a product used for IT infrastructure 
management. The attackers used this compromised build server to insert 
backdoor malware into the product (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Behavior:Win32/Solorigate.C!dha&amp;ThreatID=2147771132">called Solorigate</a> by Microsoft or <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">SUNBURST</a> by FireEye).</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory/faq">SolarWinds</a>,
 this malware was present as a Trojan horse in updates from March 
through June 2020. This means any customers who downloaded the Trojaned 
updates also got the malware. While not all customers who got the 
malware have seen it used for attacks, it has been leveraged for broader
 attacks against the networks of some strategically critical and 
sensitive organizations.</p>
<p>Those attacked <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/solarwinds-said-no-other-products-were-compromised-in-recent-hack/">include</a>
 FireEye, the US Treasury Department, the US Department of Commerce’s 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the 
Department of Health’s National Institutes of Health (NIH), the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS), and the US Department of State.</p>
<p>Everyone who has worked on this case directly has spoken to the 
sophisticated nature of the attack. The breadth, strategic importance 
and security expertise of the victims bear this out. While nearly every 
attack is called “sophisticated” by victims who try and shield 
themselves from criticism, the security community is nearly unanimous in
 its verdict that the term is merited in this case.</p>
<p>The speed, scope and scale of Microsoft’s response were 
unprecedented. Specifically, Microsoft did four things over the course 
of four days that effectively undid the work of the attackers.</p>
<p>1) On Dec. 13, the day this became public, Microsoft <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/">announced</a>
 that it removed the digital certificates that the Trojaned files used. 
These digital certificates allowed Microsoft Windows systems to believe 
that those compromised files were trustworthy. In this single act, 
Microsoft literally overnight told all Windows systems to stop trusting 
those compromised files which could stop them from being used.</p>
<p>2) That same day, Microsoft announced that it was updating Microsoft 
Windows Defender, the antimalware capability built into Windows, to 
detect and alert if it found the Trojaned file on the system.</p>
<p>3) Next, on Tuesday, Dec. 15, Microsoft and others <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-and-industry-partners-seize-key-domain-used-in-solarwinds-hack/">moved</a> to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole">sinkhole</a>”
 one of the domains that the malware uses for command and control (C2): 
avsvmcloud[.]com. SInkholing is a legal and technical tactic to deprive 
attackers of control over malware. In Sinkholing, an organization like 
Microsoft goes to court to wrest control of a domain being used for 
malicious purposes away from its current holder, the attacker.</p>
<p>When successful, the organization can then use its ownership of that 
domain to sever the attacker’s control over the malware and the systems 
the malware controls. Sinkholed domains can also be used to help 
identify compromised systems: when the malware reaches out to the 
sinkholed domain for instructions, the new owners can identify those 
systems and attempt to locate and warn the owners. Sinkholing is a 
tactic that was first used in big attacks in the 2008-2009 battle 
against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker">Conficker</a> and has been a standard tactic in Microsoft’s toolkit for years, including most recently against <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-and-other-tech-companies-orchestrate-takedown-of-trickbot-botnet/">TrickBot</a>.</p>
<p>4) Finally, today, Wednesday, Dec. 16, Microsoft basically changed 
its phasers from “stun” to “kill” by changing Windows Defender’s default
 action for Solorigate from “Alert” to “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/15/ensuring-customers-are-protected-from-solorigate/">Quarantine</a>,”
 a drastic action that could cause systems to crash but will effectively
 kill the malware when it finds it. This action is important, too, 
because it gives other security companies license now to follow suit 
with this drastic step: Microsoft’s size and leadership of its platform 
give cover to other security companies that they wouldn’t otherwise 
have.</p>
<p>Taken together, these steps amount to Microsoft first neutralizing 
and then killing the malware while wresting control over the malware’s 
infrastructure from the attackers. By the end of this week, the 
attackers will be left with barely a fraction of the systems under their
 control.</p>
<p>They may still have access to compromised networks through other 
means: that’s what incident responders are likely working on now. And 
there’s no undoing whatever they did while the infiltration went 
unnoticed for months. But still, these actions together come as close to
 obliterating an attack as we’ve seen, which is all the more notable 
because of the likely attackers.</p>
<p>In the end, this all reminds us how much power Microsoft has at its 
disposal. Between its control of the Windows operating system, its 
robust legal team, and its position in the industry, it has the power to
 change the world nearly overnight if it wants to. And when it chooses 
to train that power on an adversary, it really is the equivalent of the 
Death Star: able to completely destroy a planet in a single blast.</p>
<p>Fortunately these days, Microsoft is sparing in its use of its power. But as I’ve noted before, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/pluton-processor-microsoft-shows-strength-proves-trustworthy-computing-still-matters/">we should never mistake Microsoft’s gentleness for weakness</a>.</p>
<p>And anyway, what’s the point in having a Death Star if you don’t get to use it (for good) sometimes?</p>
