<p class="rm-manual"> by <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/author/martin/">Martin Brinkmann</a> on March 11, 2021 in <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/category/linux/" rel="category tag">Linux</a>, <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/category/software/" rel="category tag">Software</a> - <a href="#snhb-snhb_ghacks_bottom-0"> 17 comments </a></p>
<p>Each year, the free archiver 7-Zip gets updated to a new version. The
 developer of the application has released two alpha previews of this 
year's 7-Zip 21 version. Reason enough to take a look at the new version
 of 7-Zip and the changes and improvements compared to the previous 
versions of the file archiver.</p>
<p>The latest alpha release is available on the 7-Zip project site. Just <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" rel="external noopener noreferrer">download</a> the 32-bit, 64-bit or 64-bit ARM64 version of the program from the site and run the installer after the download.</p>
<p>One of the main changes, introduced in the second alpha release, 
7-Zip 21.01, is that a command line version of 7-Zip for Linux has been 
released. The release is not included in the main packages for Windows; 
the download site lists two downloads for the command line version for 
Linux that are for 32-bit/64-bit and 64-bit ARM Linux devices.</p>
<p>A readme file is included that explains core functionality of the 
command line version. The Linux version includes all changes from the 
latest 7-Zip version for Windows.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/history.txt" rel="external noopener noreferrer">full changelog</a>
 is relatively short. The first alpha version, released in January 2021,
 made internal code changes, fixed several unspecified bugs, and added 
Tajik and Uzbek localizations.</p>
<p>The latest release, 7-Zip 21.01 alpha, released on March 9, 2021, 
includes several improvements. Next to the Linux command line version, 
it is addressing a long-standing bug in 7-Zip that dates back to version
 18.02.</p>
<p>Previous versions of 7-Zip had sometimes issue extracting ZIP 
archives with xz compression; this bug is fixed in the latest alpha 
release of 7-Zip and will find its way into the next stable release of 
the application as well.</p>
<p>Speed of the ARM64 version of 7-Zip has been improved in the release 
according to the release notes. Last but not least, several bugs were 
fixed that were not mentioned specifically.</p>
<p>The alpha version ran stable and without issues on the test system; 
most users may want to wait until the final version is released. Those 
on Linux may give the new command line version a go on the other hand.</p>
<p>Now You: which file archiver do you use? (via <a href="https://www.deskmodder.de/blog/2021/03/10/7-zip-21-01-behebt-unter-anderem-ein-problem-aus-der-version-18-02-bis-21-00/" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Deskmodder</a>)</p>
