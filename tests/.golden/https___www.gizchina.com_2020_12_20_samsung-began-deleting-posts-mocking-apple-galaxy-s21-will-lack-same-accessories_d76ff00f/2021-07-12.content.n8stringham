<h1 class="rm-manual">Samsung Began Deleting Posts Mocking Apple, Galaxy S21 Will Lack Same Accessories</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span> <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/author/argam/" rel="author follow noopener noreferrer">Argam Artashyan</a> </span> <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2020/12/20/samsung-began-deleting-posts-mocking-apple-galaxy-s21-will-lack-same-accessories/" rel="bookmark follow noopener noreferrer">December 20, 2020</a> </p>
<p>Among the many arguable things in the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2020/10/27/apple-iphone-12-pros-vs-cons-see-our-final-verdict/" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">iPhone12</a>
 series this year, the cancellation of the power adapters and earphones 
is probably the most widely ‘ridiculed’ point. On the other hand, Apple 
and Samsung are the closest rivals. And every move each of them makes, 
will be criticized by another one undoubtedly. In this regard, when the 
iPhone 12 was out and we found no charger and headphones inside the box,
 Samsung began joking on this. However, it seems the Galaxy S21 seems to
 be preparing to follow in the footsteps of the iPhone 12. Moreover, 
Samsung officials seem to have deleted previous posts mocking Apple.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Samsung was still mocking Apple for launching the 
iPhone 12 without a charger, and announced that ‘Our Galaxy phone can 
provide you with everything you need, from the basic charger to the best
 camera, battery, performance, and memory.’ From this point of you, we 
have been thinking that Samsung will focus on what Apple has ‘missed’ 
and will bring a 120Hz screen as well as the charger. We were naïve.</p>

<p>Now, as we can see, Samsung has deleted their Facebook posts mocking 
Apple. This has become a strong evidence of its decision to <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2020/12/08/samsung-galaxy-s21-will-not-come-with-a-charger-or-headphones/" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">imitate Apple</a>.
 It is worth noting that Brazil and the European market are facing this 
situation. It is unclear whether other markets will follow up on this 
decision.</p>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy S21 Features</h3>
<p>In other aspects, according to previously exposed news, the new 
Samsung Galaxy S21 series will still have the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+ 
and Galaxy S21 Ultra three models. They all will adopt a center-opening 
full-screen design. The S21 and S21+ will sport a flat/straight screen 
design, while the S21 Ultra will use a curved screen. In addition to the
 new Snapdragon 888 chip, selected markets will get a version equipped 
with its own brand new Samsung Exynos 2100 mobile platform.</p>

<p>The new Samsung Galaxy S21 series flagship will be unveiled on 
January 14 next year. Of course, the selling point is the chip Qualcomm 
Snapdragon 888 and Samsung Exynos 2100 based on 5nm process. But it will
 come with an improved camera, faster charging, and other highlights as 
well.</p>

<h4 class="rm-manual">Argam Artashyan</h4>
<p class="rm-manual">Back in 2010, he was dismissed from his position as
 a lecturer at the university. This made him get another job at his 
friend’s digital marketing company as a blog writer. After a few years, 
when he was thinking the article writing is his mission, Google pushed 
the Panda update and affected the company and websites he was working 
at. (Un)fortunately and surprisingly, he got an offer to head a large 
knitting factory. In 2016, he got his Ph.D. and resumed teaching at the 
University … and writing tech-related articles following his passion.</p>
