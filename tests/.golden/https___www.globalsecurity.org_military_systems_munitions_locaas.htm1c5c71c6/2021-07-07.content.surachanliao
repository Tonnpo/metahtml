<h2 class="rm-manual">Low Cost Autonomous Attack System (LOCAAS)</h2>
<p>As of 07 January 1998 ACC approved a new acquisition strategy for the
 Small Bomb System (SBS) program. This strategy involves integrating the
 SBS on the F-22, F-22X and JSF and also includes combining the SBS and 
the Low Cost Autonomous Attack System (LOCAAS) efforts into a single 
program. This new program has been designated Miniature Munition 
Capability and has a planned start date for FY03. Implementation details
 of the new strategy are still being developed. </p>
<p> The LOCAAS is envisioned as a miniature, autonomous powered munition
 capable of broad area search, identification, and destruction of a 
range of mobile ground targets. LOCAAS is a low-cost LADAR sensor 
coupled with a multimode warhead and a maneuvering airframe to produce a
 high performance submunition. The warhead can be detonated as a long 
rod penetrator, an aerostable slug, or as fragments based on the 
hardness of the target. The LADAR allows target aimpoint and warhead 
selection to be determined automatically. The powered LOCAAS uses small 
turbojet engine which is capable of powering the vehicle for up to 30 
minutes. Powered LOCAAS has a 33 sq. nm search area. On 17 December 1998
 the Air Force Research Laboratory, Eglin AFB awarded Lockheed Martin of
 Dallas TX a $32,942,000 Other-Transaction-for-Prototype contract to 
provide for the Powered Low Cost Autonomous Attack Submunition 
(P-LOCAAS) advanced technology demonstration.This program includes 
system design, concept definition, fabrication and test of a LOCAAS 
prototype. An Other Transaction is a special acquisition method to 
develop prototype projects for which most procurement laws and the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation do not apply, thus allowing greater 
flexibility in meeting government requirements. Expected contract 
completion date is 10 December 2001. </p>
<p>The Munition Directorate Assessment and Demonstrations Division of 
the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) planned to pursue a procurement
 of an Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) program for the Powered 
Low Cost Autonomous Attack System (LOCAAS). The anticipated contract 
value of this effort is $12-14M between FY99-02. The purpose of the ATD 
is to demonstrate that a low cost, [NTE $30K average unit production 
cost (AUPC), not including the cost of dispensers/dispensing 
mechanisms], system can be produced using a Multi-Mode Warhead, solid 
state Laser Radar (LADAR) seeker with Autonomous Target Recognition 
(ATR), and INS/GPS midcourse guidance and that these components can be 
integrated into an air vehicle powered by a miniature turbojet engine. </p>
<p> The overall objective of the ATD is to provide an affordable 
standoff (minimum 90 miles) miniature munition to autonomously search 
for, detect, identify, attack, and destroy theater missile defense, 
surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems (i.e. SEAD) and interdiction/armor 
targets of military interest. The system will be capable of 
discriminating between classes/types of targets and between targets and 
non-combatants. The Powered LOCAAS system will be designed so as to be 
produced for less than $30,000 AUPC based on production of 12,000 units 
in 1994 base year dollars. </p>
<p> The basic strategy contemplated for the ATD is a four phased program. </p>
<p> Phase I may consist of no more than two fully qualified contractors 
competing for downselect. This is a 6-12 month effort consisting of 
three main tasks. (1) Concept Definition: Which consists of a complete 
requirements flow down for entire munition system and address all 
munition performance requirements as well as mission planning 
dispense/delivery concepts. (2) System Design: A Detailed design for the
 entire munition, to include tactical safe/arm device (or function) and 
warhead interface. Munition design must be compatible with TMD (SUU-64, 
66, 4 LOCAAS/TMD) dispense and be form/fit compatible with ATACMS and 
MLRS. In order to verify a dispensable design, sufficient level details 
must be provided for the TMD dispense system. (3) Preliminary Seeker 
Captive Test: Operate a tactical seeker testbed in accordance with the 
concept definition and system design. All proposed scan modes and 
decision logic must be implemented in both hardware and software 
(including ATR). The ability to autonomously identify targets in all 
three target groups (Attack Ops, SEAD, Armor/Interdiction) must be 
demonstrated. The ATR must be demonstrated in real time operation using a
 representative flight processor. </p>
<p> Phase II is a 2-year effort that will consist of three major tasks. 
(1) Tactical Seeker Fabrication &amp; Qualification: Fabricate a form 
factored seeker for captive flight test. Seeker optics and gimbals 
should be essentially identical to those fabricated for flight test, 
with the exception of any modifications necessary to ensure extended use
 under captive flight test. (2) KHILS Seeker Fab &amp; Installation 
Support: Fabricate tactical seeker (for delivery to AFRL's KHILS 
facility) will include mass balance gimbals/gimbal control system, PCE 
board, and flight processor (optical elements will consist of mass 
balance mockups). (3) Tactical Seeker captive Test: Test will 
demonstrate performance of seeker under full range of tactical 
scenarios. A minimum of three, 4-week test sequences in different 
geographical locations will be conducted, covering the full spectrum of 
LOCAAS targets and background settings. Performance vs. Known (deployed 
or soon to be deployed) countermeasure will be evaluated. Specific exit 
criteria will be established for selected missions and the LADAR/ATR 
performance will be judged against these criteria. </p>
<p>Phase III is a 2-year 6-month effort to be run in parallel with Phase
 II. This phase will consist of 2 major tasks. (1) Tactical Munition 
Fabrication: Fabricate flight test articles to support a control flight 
test and three powered, guided flight tests with inert warheads. 
Sufficient number of warheads shall be fabricated to demonstrate 
tactical level performance, including end-to-end fire train. (2) 
Tactical Munition Qualification: Qualification test for entire range of 
test environments. </p>
<p> Phase IV is the culmination of Phases I - III and shall conduct up to four guided flight tests as discussed above. </p>
