<p>A twin-seat variation of China's J-20 stealth fighter jet and a J-20 
version equipped with a domestically made engine have been spotted for 
the first time in official videos recently released by its developer and
 the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force, only days before the 10th
 anniversary on Monday of the aircraft's maiden flight.</p>
<p>The twin-seat variation of the J-20 could be used for electronic 
warfare, command of wingman drones or bombing, and the domestic engine 
means the J-20 is no longer reliant on Russian engines, analysts said on
 Sunday.</p>
<p>Depicted by computer-generated imagery, four twin-seat J-20 
variations were seen flying in formation in a video released by 
state-owned Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), the developer of the
 aircraft, on Friday, in celebration of the 10th anniversary on Monday 
of the original aircraft's maiden flight.</p>
<p>This is the first time the twin-seat J-20 has been featured in an 
official promotional source, although media reports had speculated about
 its existence for years. It will also make the J-20 variation the 
world's first twin-seat stealth fighter jet, media reported.</p>
<p>By adding another seat to the cockpit, the aircraft could, in 
exchange for some level of stealth capability and maneuverability, carry
 a second pilot designated for more complicated tasks such as electronic
 warfare, command of wingman drones or tactical bombing, a Chinese 
military analyst told the Global Times on Sunday, requesting anonymity.</p>
<p>This means the twin-seat J-20 could spawn more variations that are 
equipped with devices corresponding to these tasks, the analyst 
predicted. </p>
<p>AVIC's video did not elaborate on the twin-seat J-20 or its designed functions.</p>
<p>In a separate video, released on Tuesday by the People's Liberation 
Army (PLA) Air Force for its pilot recruitment program, Chinese media 
outlets identified a J-20 that is equipped with domestically developed 
WS-10C engines instead of imported Russian engines.</p>
<p>This is also the first time the PLA Air Force has confirmed that a 
J-20 equipped with a domestically made engine has entered service, 
Passion News, a media outlet under k618.cn, a news portal run by the 
Communist Youth League of China Central Committee, reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Designed with stealth capability, the WS-10C engines provide more 
powerful thrust than the Russian engines previously used on the J-20, 
since the Chinese engines use full authority digital engine control 
technology and improved afterburners, the Passion News report said.</p>
<p>Domestic engines will not only let the J-20 become stronger, but also
 enable the mass production of the aircraft without the limitation of 
imported engines, analysts said, noting that the J-20 will eventually 
use the WS-15, an even more powerful domestically developed engine.</p>
