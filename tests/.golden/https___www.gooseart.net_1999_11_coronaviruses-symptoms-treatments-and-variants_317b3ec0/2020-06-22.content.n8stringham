<p>Coronaviruses are viruses, belonging to the subfamily Coronavirinae 
in the family Coronaviridae, that typically affect the respiratory tract
 of mammals, including humans – they are associated with the common 
cold, pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The virus 
may also affect the gut. A coronavirus was first isolated in 1937 – it 
was an avian infectious bronchitis virus which had (and still has) the 
ability to seriously devastate poultry stocks. According to the Health 
Protection Agency (HPA), UK, it can also infect the uro-genital tract of
 chickens, and eventually spread to various organs in its body. Over the
 last 70 years, scientists have found that related coronaviruses can 
infect mice, rats, dogs, cats, turkeys, horses, pigs and cattle. What 
are human coronaviruses? Coronavirus symptoms and treatments What is the
 novel coronavirus (NCoV)? NCoV transmission Symptoms of NCoV infection 
How many human coronaviruses are there? SARS Human coronaviruses (HCoV) 
were first identified in the 1960s from the naval cavities of patients 
with the common cold. Approximatley 30% of common colds are caused by 
two human coronaviruses – OC43 and 229E. Coronaviruses are thus called 
because of their crown-like projections on their surfaces. “Corona” in 
Latin means “halo” or “crown.” Coronaviruses… <a href="file:///go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjU2NTIxLnBocA==" rel="nofollow">Read full this story</a></p>
