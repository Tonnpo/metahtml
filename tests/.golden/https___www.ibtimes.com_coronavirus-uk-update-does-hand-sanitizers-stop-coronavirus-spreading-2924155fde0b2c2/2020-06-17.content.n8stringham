<h1 class="rm-manual">Coronavirus UK Update: Does Hand Sanitizers Stop Coronavirus From Spreading</h1>

<h3 class="rm-manual">KEY POINTS</h3>
<ul class="rm-manual">
<li class="rm-manual">Coronavirus has now claimed many lives around the world with the numbers steadily increasing</li>
<li class="rm-manual">Many are trying to find ways and means on how to effectively prevent the virus from spreading</li>
<li class="rm-manual">One doctor has answered whether using a hand sanitizer can prevent its spread</li>
</ul>
<p>The fear and anxiety that the coronavirus has brought to different 
nations in the world are still present. Health agencies would give 
advice on how people can protect themselves from the disease, which 
originated from Wuhan, China. In the said country, people wear masks. 
The WHO advises proper hygiene, especially washing hands with soap and 
water every time.</p>
<p>Since water is not readily available 24/7, such as when you are at a 
location where there’s just no viable water source, people are now 
asking if they can use hand sanitizers instead. One doctor has answered 
this pervading question.</p>
<p>Keeping Hands Clean</p>
<p>Using Hand Sanitizers</p>
<p>The doctor, however, emphasized that since washing with soap and 
water can be impractical if you’re traveling, your best option is to use
 a hand sanitizer. Make sure that you use it thoroughly. Before handling
 food, it would be best to use a sanitizer.</p>
<p>A Corroborative Opinion</p>
<p>Another expert, Professor Stephen Turner from a prestigious 
university in Australia, said that hand sanitizers are indeed among the 
most effective ways to stop the spread of the virus. He added that it is
 definite if it is a good quality kind of sanitizer.</p>
<p>Coronavirus has already caused quite a stir all over the world. From 
the time that the news of the virus broke out up to present, the death 
toll has already reached more than 1,770 as of writing, with the numbers
 continue rising.</p>
<p>The most number of deaths were in China. Outside the origin country, 
Japan came in second with 251, followed by Singapore with 58. The UK has
 already reported a casualty, as well as other non-Asian countries. 
While there is still no known cure for the virus, the WHO, including 
health agencies of different countries, is working on the double to find
 how to beat the deadly virus.</p>
