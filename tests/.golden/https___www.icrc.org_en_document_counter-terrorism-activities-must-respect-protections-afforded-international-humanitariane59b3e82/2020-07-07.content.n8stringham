<p>Mr. Chair,</p>
<p>Terrorism negates the fundamental principle of humanity. It is 
contrary to many underlying principles and core objectives of 
international humanitarian law (IHL). The ICRC condemns acts of 
terrorism and is deeply distressed by the devastating impact of these 
acts on communities and individuals.</p>
<p>States and international organizations have reacted by developing a comprehensive and multi-layered counter-terrorism framework.</p>
<p>The ICRC does not challenge the legitimacy of States to take the 
measures necessary to ensure their security and eliminate terrorism. 
Nevertheless, Member States must be clear and firm about the need for 
counter-terrorism activities to be conducted with full respect for the 
protections afforded to all individuals by international law, in 
particular IHL and human rights law.</p>
<p>Importantly, these bodies of international law must be respected when
 individuals are arrested and detained in connection with terrorism. 
Their designation as so-called "foreign terrorist fighters," or the 
nature of the acts they may have committed, may in no way be invoked as a
 justification for the non-observance of the legal protections they are 
entitled to under international law, notably IHL, when applicable. 
Independent and neutral monitoring mechanisms, such as the International
 Committee of the Red Cross, should be granted access to these 
individuals, so that they can assist detaining authorities in ensuring 
that detainees are treated humanely and in conformity with applicable 
international law and standards.</p>
<p>In relation to the counter-terrorism measures taken against "foreign 
fighters" and their families, the ICRC is particularly concerned by the 
situation of children. Children affected by such measures, even those 
accused of crimes, are first and foremost victims. In this regard, the 
General Assembly has called upon Member States to ensure that children 
associated or allegedly associated with armed groups should be treated 
primarily as victims, as it did in the 2018 Resolution on the Rights of 
the Child. Children must be detained only as a last resort and they must
 be treated with due consideration for their age and individual 
vulnerabilities. The ICRC encourages States to find solutions that are 
in the best interest of these children, notably by ensuring that they 
are not separated from their parents and siblings, and by giving due 
consideration to their repatriation, when in the best interest of these 
children.</p>
<p>Mr. Chair,</p>
<p>On various occasions since 2011, the ICRC has underscored the 
potential adverse effects on humanitarian action of certain 
counter-terrorism measures taken by States, both internationally and 
domestically.</p>
<p>Humanitarian activities undertaken by impartial humanitarian 
organizations, including those in favor of wounded and sick fighters, 
must never be considered as a form of unlawful support to non-State 
actors or individuals designated as terrorists or criminalized under 
international, regional or domestic laws. The ICRC recalls that such 
activities are an integral part of the humanitarian mandate assigned to 
impartial humanitarian organizations by the State parties to the Geneva 
Conventions of 1949 and their 1977 Additional Protocols.</p>
<p>In the ICRC's view, sanctions regimes and criminal laws dealing with 
terrorism should exclude from their scope of application activities that
 are exclusively humanitarian and impartial. Such exclusions – also 
known as "humanitarian exemptions" – and other mitigating measures, 
would be in line with the letter and spirit of IHL and therefore 
compatible with States' obligations under that body of law. Failure to 
exclude these activities from criminal laws dealing with terrorism would
 lead to the negation of the notion of neutral, independent and 
impartial humanitarian action and jeopardize the mission of impartial 
humanitarian organizations to protect and assist people affected by 
armed conflict, particularly in areas where non-State armed groups 
designated as terrorist are active. These are areas in which the needs 
of the population are often more acute.</p>
<p>In this regard, the ICRC welcomes the recent inclusion of paragraphs 
regarding humanitarian activities in counter-terrorism Security Council 
Resolutions 2462 and 2482. These paragraphs urge all States to "take 
into account" the potential effect of counter-terrorism measures on 
"exclusively humanitarian activities" carried out by "impartial 
humanitarian actors" in a manner consistent with IHL. We further welcome
 the readiness of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED) and
 others to explore and report upon this issue in 2020.</p>
<p>Mr. Chair, thank you very much.</p></article>
