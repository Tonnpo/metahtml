        </head><body><article><p>The launch of one or more unidentified 
missiles from North Korea has been detected by the Japanese coast guard 
and the South Korean military, mere hours after Pyongyang said it would 
resume denuclearization talks with the US.</p>
<p>At least one projectile was launched from Wonsan in the Kangwon 
province, eastward into the sea, Yonhap news agency reported on 
Wednesday citing South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. The projectile was
 not identified.</p>
<p>This is the first missile test since the launch of two unidentified 
projectiles on September 10, and the 11th missile launch since May, when
 Korea resumed testing after the failure of talks with the US in 
Vietnam.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the US State Department announced the resumption of talks
 with North Korea at staff level, with the US delegation being led by 
special envoy Stephen Biegun. This follows the June meeting between US 
President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the 
Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.</p>
<p> Trump’s Bold Move In North Korea</p>
<p> Peter in Chicago called in to compare North Korea to Venezuela. Alex agrees that North Korea has incentive to <a href="https://banned.video/watch?id=5c746b4038c608001f11068c" rel="noopener">strike a deal with Trump</a> and benefit their country.</p>
<p>Trump and Kim met in Hanoi in February for a second summit dedicated 
to denuclearizing the Korean peninsula and maybe even ending the Korean 
War, kept frozen since the 1953 armistice. However, the summit abruptly 
ended when the US rejected North Korean proposal for a partial lifting 
of sanctions as a gesture of goodwill.</p>
<p>While South Korea and Japan have been alarmed at the uptick in missile tests, Trump has dismissed it as business as usual.</p>
<p>“He likes testing missiles,” he said of Kim after the August 24 test,
 adding that the North Korean leader “has been pretty straight with me –
 and we’re going to see what’s going on.”</p>
