 elite Revolutionary Guard said it has brought down an Israeli stealth 
drone above the Natanz uranium enrichment site in the center of the 
country.</span></p> <p><span>"A spy drone of the Zionist regime (Israel)
 was brought down by a missile... This stealth drone was trying to 
approach the Natanz nuclear zone," the corps said in a statement on its 
official website </span>sepahnews.com<span>.</span></p> <p>This act 
demonstrates a new adventurism by the Zionist regime... The 
Revolutionary Guard and the other armed forces reserve the right to 
respond to this act," the statement added.</p> <p><span>An Israeli spokesman told AFP in Jerusalem on Sunday that the military does </span><span>"not address foreign media reports".</span></p> <p>Natanz
 is Iran's main uranium enrichment site, housing more than 16,000 
centrifuges. Around 3,000 more are at the Fordow plant, buried inside a 
mountain and hard to destroy.</p> <p>Israel has often threatened to attack Iranian nuclear installations.</p> <p>Iran
 and the P5+1 powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia, the United 
States and Germany -- reached a six-month interim agreement under which 
Iran suspended part of its nuclear activities in return for a partial 
lifting of international sanctions.</p> <p>In July, that deal was 
extended by four months, until November 24, to give the two sides more 
time to negotiate a final accord aimed at ending 10 years of tensions 
over Iran's nuclear program.</p> <p>The sides remain split on how much uranium enrichment Iran should be allowed to carry out.</p> <p>Washington
 wants Tehran to slash its program by three-quarters, but Iran wants to 
expand enrichment ten-fold by 2021, chiefly to produce fuel for its 
Bushehr nuclear power plant.</p> <p>Israel, which Iran considers its 
sworn enemy, opposes any agreement allowing Tehran to keep part of its 
uranium enrichment program saying Iran would use the material to make an
 atomic bomb.</p> <p>Iran has repeatedly vowed to wipe Israel off the map.</p> <p>In
 2010, the Israeli Air Force launched an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), 
dubbed "Eitan," "Heron TP" or "Heron 2", which can stay in the air 24 
hours and can reach Iran. </p> <p>“The ‘Eitan’ marks a technological 
breakthrough and a new level in the Air Force's ability to operate 
against threats, near and far, in its <span>every day</span> missions and during emergencies,” IDF spokesmen said.</p> <p>Military
 officials declined to say whether the new UAV was designed for use 
against Iran and did not specifically mention the Islamic Republic, but 
foreign <span>news services</span> noted that the Eitan can fly as far as Iran. </p> <p>"The
 launching of this airplane is another substantial landmark in the 
development of unmanned aerial vehicles.” Maj.-Gen. Nehushtan said. 
“They have gone from the humble beginning of their development, with 
initial operational results during the first Lebanon war, to the 
substantial and professional apparatus that now accompanies almost any 
air force operational frame work.”</p> <p>The Eitan was grounded for much of 2012 following a mysterious crash during test flights.</p> </article> </td> </tr>
