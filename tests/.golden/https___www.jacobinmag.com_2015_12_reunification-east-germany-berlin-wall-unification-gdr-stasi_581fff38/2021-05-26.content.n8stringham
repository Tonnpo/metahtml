<p>This fall marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of German reunification,
 the culmination of what the dominant narrative of the period calls the 
“Peaceful Revolution,” beginning with the popular uprisings in 
October–November 1989. In East German vernacular, this radical break 
with the Stalinist dictatorship is known as the Wende (“turn”), but in 
the political sense carries a meaning more akin to “change.”</p>
<p>Neither of these framings quite capture the contradictions of 
reunification and the way in which they prefigured similar developments 
in the process of European unification.</p>
<p>The political transformation of East Germany occurred at a remarkable
 speed — within a year the Stalinist political system of the German 
Democratic Republic (GDR) had not only collapsed, but been united with 
the West German state. This political unification was followed by an 
equally fast economic unification, which sparked an unprecedented wave 
of deindustrialization over the next three or four years.</p>
<p>Thus Germany experienced its own type of the <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/the-misery-of-the-mezzogiorno/a-18667335">Mezzogiorno effec</a>t:
 the new federal states of the East became in many ways analogous to 
southern Italy, characterized by high unemployment, low or even negative
 economic growth, and financial dependence on subsidies from the rest of
 the country. Not surprisingly, more than <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/two-million-fewer-people-in-former-east-since-german-reunification/a-18749892">two million</a>
 (out of a pre-Wende population of seventeen million) easterners have 
left the region since reunification, a number approaching the amount of 
refugees who fled the country before the construction of the Berlin Wall
 in 1961.</p>
<p>Unique to the East German experience was the population’s integration
 into the West German welfare system, which helped to soften the social 
consequences of reunification compared to the rest of the former Eastern
 Bloc. Of course, the necessary increases in state welfare payments 
reunification entailed were financed by taxpayers in both the East and 
the West, while the major beneficiary of the whole process was West 
German capital, for whom reunification opened up a whole national 
economy to both buy up and sell consumer goods to.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it is tempting to dismiss the reunification process as
 a coup by the West German ruling class, in which naïve Easterners were 
simply duped. This narrative is not only overly simplistic, it also 
obscures the fact that a large part of East German workers, employees, 
and pensioners who opposed the Stalinist dictatorship regarded national 
“unity in freedom” as historical progress and hoped for a better life 
than what they had in the GDR.</p>
<p>Instead, German unification should be seen as a deeply contradictory 
process, similar to that of nineteenth-century German unification in 
1871, as theorized by Karl Marx or August Bebel. Both welcomed 
liberation from local tyrannies and the fostering of national unity as 
progressive for its time, without ignoring their reactionary character 
and the classes under whose hegemony these processes were carried out.</p>
<p>Thus, East Germans today enjoy democratic freedoms and cultural 
modernization, but are subjected to internal colonization as well as 
mass unemployment — a contradiction that also applies to the radical 
changes that occurred in other parts of Eastern Europe.</p>
<h1>East Germany at the Crossroads</h1>
<p>East German society in 1989 faced a new beginning. The majority of 
the population still consisted of blue- and white-collar workers, but 
four decades of political repression had erased any collective 
traditions of independent working-class activity. A kind of 
welfare-dictatorial compromise, in which the masses accommodated 
themselves to the regime in exchange for rising living standards and a 
certain level of personal autonomy, had fostered internal stability and 
an absence of visible social conflict.</p>
<p>The younger generation had never witnessed a strike or other forms of
 (non-state-directed) collective political agency, while the working 
class itself remained atomized. As a consequence, the political 
opposition that began to emerge in the 1970s developed primarily within 
marginal subcultural milieus, insulated from the majority of the 
population. In autumn 1989 these oppositional currents encountered the 
majority for the first time, while the masses were rediscovering 
political self-activity and self-organization at a very fast pace.</p>
<p>Some historians argue that the ruling <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Socialist-Unity-Party-of-Germany">Socialist Unity Party’s (SED)</a> dictatorship imploded inevitably out of the destabilizing effects of former Soviet leader <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mikhail-Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev’s</a>
 reforms and mass emigration to the West. Though these factors certainly
 played a role, they alone do not explain why such a well-established <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1984-12-01/nomenklatura-soviet-ruling-class">nomenklatura</a> and their armed regime liquidated itself in a matter of eight weeks.</p>
<p>The swift resignation of the regime was not voluntary, but occurred 
under pressure from the street, which was fed by the discontent in the 
factories. Thus the “fall of the wall” was the result of a spontaneous 
democratic mass movement, centered upon mass demonstrations developing 
at breathtaking speed.</p>
<p>Between October 7 and the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/world-history/fall-of-the-berlin-wall-timeline-of-a-year-of-wonder-when-the-unthinkable-became-the-unstoppable-9821984.html">fall of the wall</a>
 on November 9, a German “October revolution” was carried out. In these 
weeks not only Erich Honecker, the all-powerful general secretary of the
 SED, but also the central committee and the nominal government were 
forced to resign.</p>
<p>The movement’s first major breakthrough, a <a href="https://vimeo.com/112118083">successful demonstration</a>
 of seventy thousand in the city of Leipzig on October 9, was enabled by
 a split within the leadership. While Honecker wanted to deploy tanks 
against the protestors, a majority in the Politburo favored political 
solutions — a policy of “dialogue,” through which they hoped to wear 
down the opposition. But the strategy failed, and the demonstrations 
grew.</p>
<p>In the week before the fall of the wall, the Stasi recorded over 1.3 
million participants in demonstrations and other protests across the 
country. Altogether somewhere between 2.5 and 5 million citizens, almost
 a third of the country’s population, participated directly in the 
movement. Even more were involved in the transformations of institutions
 and factories.</p>
<p>Unlike the democratic movements in the other Eastern Bloc states, the
 revolutionary wave in East Germany penetrated deep into a majority of 
the country’s smaller towns and villages, and lasted much longer, into 
February 1990.</p>
<p>The mass involvement of workers, artists, and engineers gave this 
movement the character of an authentic people’s movement. The well-known
 slogan from the period, Wir sind das Volk! (“We are the people!”), was 
an expression both of the heterogeneous composition of the movement 
itself as well as of how participants perceived themselves.</p>
<p>The resignation of the old guard and the fall of the wall brought 
political freedom and democratic rights to the citizens of the GDR, 
while the so-called “roundtable” negotiations between the SED and 
representatives of the opposition led to the first democratic elections 
on March 18, 1990. Most importantly, these negotiations led to the 
adoption of a new draft constitution of the GDR and the drawing up of a 
“social charter” outlining the social rights of citizens that were to be
 defended in negotiations with the West.</p>
<p>These roundtable negotiations, which occurred not only on the federal
 but also the regional and municipal levels, temporarily constituted 
what socialists would describe as a situation of dual power, held on the
 one hand by the existing ruling state apparatus, but contested from 
below by the self-organization of the masses.</p>
<p>This process marked, in my opinion, the beginnings of a kind of 
red-green citizens’ democracy — a social, ecological, and antifascist 
republic. In this new GDR, which I call the second GDR, plebiscitary and
 ecological rights were enshrined next to democratic and social rights 
such as women’s rights, which the West German trade unions, women’s 
movement, and other social movements had advocated for decades.</p>
<p>These rights included a plurality of property forms in a mixed 
economy, certain trade union and environmental rights, a liberalized 
abortion law, and the inclusion of participatory ballot measures in 
national elections. And, of course, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/why-berlin-cannot-forget-the-stasi-2002600.html">despised Stasi</a>
 was unequivocally abolished. Because the East German people were 
increasingly demanding unification, many resolutions of the roundtable 
took an all-German perspective into account.</p>
<p>What was emerging in the East was not socialism, but a kind of 
radical-democratic republic, spurred on by the demands of the mass 
movement and inspired at least partially by previous developments in 
West German social movements. Nevertheless, the democratic revolution 
remained fragile, as the opposition lacked a coherent political force 
capable of converting the movement into durable forms of state power.</p>
<p>Following the fall of the wall, East German employees turned their 
attention to the workplaces, to the caste of party bureaucrats who 
administered the GDR’s economy. As the revolution spread into the 
factories, workplace-level party organs and party-directed militias were
 dissolved. Employees began to organize initiatives for independent 
unions and shop councils, albeit to a limited extent.</p>
<p>After the fall of the wall and the revolutionary penetration of state
 institutions and factories the SED government collapsed. At the 
beginning of December a younger generation of reformers around the 
figure of Gregor Gysi (now a prominent leader of the European Left 
Party) took over the party in a kind of palace coup. Throughout this 
period, the popular desire to abolish and eliminate the Stasi remained a
 constant theme.</p>
<h1>The Reversal</h1>
<p>A crucial aspect of the shift in mood among workers after the fall of
 the wall was the emergence of an unregulated market economy in the 
East. The state economic managers liberated from central control began 
to act in an independent, capitalist manner.</p>
<p>Many East German employees were frightened of the prospect of a 
capitalist system run by the old SED nomenklatura, whom they distrusted.
 Faced with this stark reality, many employees, even workers, opted for 
the efficient and rationally organized capitalism of West Germany, in 
which trade unions were well-established, powerful entities, instead of 
the uncertainties that a capitalist GDR presented.</p>
<p>The first demands for reunification surfaced at demonstrations in 
November 1989. But a public opinion poll in December 1989 revealed that 
even at this stage over two-thirds of those polled favored a democratic,
 independent GDR. This mood would reverse dramatically in the weeks to 
follow.</p>
<p>Beginning in December, the situation of dual power that had emerged 
in the previous weeks was disrupted by the start of electoral campaigns 
for the upcoming elections in March. At this point, West German parties 
began to actively intervene in East German politics.</p>
<p>The newly established Social Democratic Party of the GDR and the 
oppositional group “Democratic Awakening,” which suffered a split 
following its decision to orient itself toward the West German Christian
 Democrats, quickly linked up with the political machines of their 
Western counterparts and began occupying the political spaces opened up 
by the revolution.</p>
<p>The SED, now renamed the SED-PDS (PDS standing for “Party of 
Democratic Socialism”) and outfitted with a new leadership, launched a 
political counteroffensive in the form of a campaign against the 
perceived danger of a far-right revival in East Germany.</p>
<p>This campaign succeeded in uniting the still strong but 
disintegrating apparatus of the SED, together with well-known Stalinist 
party members and officers from the secret police. Appropriately enough,
 it was connected with a campaign for a new secret service with the old 
personnel. Even at this time a circle of Stasi officers in the 
Thuringian city of Gera publicly called for a counterrevolutionary coup 
d’etat.</p>
<p>The SED-PDS campaigned backfired. An anti-socialist wave rose and 
conquered the masses, even the workers. Rather than rallying East German
 workers around a vision of an independent and democratic GDR, the 
opposite occurred: the majority of East German society unified against a
 possible return of the old East German apparatus. This is the point at 
which the conservative current became hegemonic.</p>
<p>East Germany’s majority turned to the only force that seemed capable 
of guaranteeing political stability, economic prosperity, democracy, and
 the prevention of the return of the SED government: the West German 
government, led by Christian Democrat Helmut Kohl. Many East German 
workers also perceived the Kohl government as the safest bet to ensure a
 swift introduction of the <a href="http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=3071">West German Deutschmark</a>.</p>
<p>The conservative-neoliberal forces deployed the tried and tested 
conservative slogan of “No experiments!” and changed the existing slogan
 of “We are the people!” into the slogan “We are one people!” to 
galvanize public opinion against the possibility of a radical 
democratic, social, and ecological GDR as an alternative to West 
Germany. Though most people taking up the slogans probably did not 
realize it at the time, they had adopted the language of conservative 
and German nationalist forces.</p>
<p>As political and social questions became closely entwined with those 
of the free-market economy and fears of the old regime’s possible 
return, Kohl and the West German political establishment exploited this 
opportunity to consolidate hegemony over the movement in the East. This 
consolidation found expression in the outstanding victory of the 
conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the first <a href="http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-03-20/news/9001300423_1_rapid-unification-social-democrats-east-germany">democratic elections</a> on March 18, 1990.</p>
<p>The majority of workers voted for the CDU and continued to do so in 
following elections. The oppositional organizations of the citizens’ 
movement, which had authentically represented the masses at the 
beginning of the revolution, failed miserably. Divided into three 
competing lists, their combined vote total barely reached 10 percent.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the 1989 revolution could have had a different 
outcome. Crucial to the failure of the movement, however, were the 
weaknesses of the GDR opposition. On the one hand it had neither the 
will nor the ability to pick up the power that had been “lying on the 
streets,” so to speak, in November and December. Instead, it pursued a 
negotiated solution through the institutions of the roundtable, in which
 it was outmaneuvered.</p>
<p>Additionally, most of the opposition vastly underestimated the 
importance of the employees and even the workers, but also workplace 
activity to the potential success or failure of the revolution. Nor was 
the opposition able to relate positively to the genuine desire of the 
majority of East Germans for national reunification or articulate a 
coherent alternative to solve the ongoing economic and social crisis 
going on in the country, which gave additional momentum to the forces of
 West German conservatism and reaction.</p>
<p>Lastly, the opposition greatly overestimated the danger posed by the 
decrepit and seriously weakened SED apparatus, blinding it to the much 
greater danger posed by West German capital and its patriotic campaign.</p>
<h1>Workers Left Behind</h1>
<p>The abandonment of independent East German “social experiments” in 
favor of “proven German capitalism” in the form of national unity and 
radical privatization policies gave German reunification a decidedly 
reactionary character. Unification was accompanied by an outright defeat
 and demoralization of the West German left and the dramatic 
fragmentation of German society under the weight of neoliberalism. The 
total collapse of the East German economy was the result.</p>
<p>Following the initial popular, democratic uprising, many East German 
workers operated as a kind of “counterrevolution from below” against the
 incipient East German citizens’ democracy, many under the tutelage of 
the West German bourgeoisie. This specific form of counterrevolution did
 not restore the SED dictatorship. Instead, it eliminated the remnants 
of the Stalinist “revolution from above” post-1945, such as state-owned 
enterprises, and also eliminated the revolutionary structures of the 
1989 uprising in favor of West German capital.</p>
<p>Although historical analogies are often problematic, the counterrevolutionary alliance of 1990 is comparable to that of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Thermidorian-Reaction">Thermidor</a>
 against the revolutionary Montagnards in France, or perhaps even more 
appropriately to the bottom-up alliances between peasants and the urban 
bourgeoisie in the Russian revolution. 1990 constituted, if you will, a 
“Thermidor from below.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we find remnants of the revolutionary events of 1989 in
 the self-activity of the East German population today, such as the 
so-called Monday demonstrations against the austerity measures and 
increased sanctions against the unemployed instituted by the Social 
Democratic–Green coalition in 2003–4.</p>
<p>Ultimately, developing an analysis of the East German revolution does
 not only carry implications for the question of German unity or the 
restoration of the capitalist system as an abstract case. German 
reunification was intrinsically linked to a fundamental shift in the 
social and political balance of forces in Germany and to the victory of 
neoliberalism more generally — a phenomenon which has affected all 
levels of society in a dramatic way.</p>
<p>The reactionary sea change in German society was thoroughgoing and 
complete. The majority of East German jobs were not modernized as 
promised, but instead liquidated by mass privatization. Thus East German
 workers never reached the goal they sought to achieve through 
reunification, namely the West German–style welfare capitalism of the 
Bonn Republic.</p>
<p>In a sense, the fall of the GDR brought with it the end of the Bonn 
Republic and thus the European postwar constellation as a whole. Late 
twentieth-century Germany was marked most significantly not by the end 
of Soviet empire in the East, but rather by that of welfare capitalism 
in the West.</p>
