<h1 class="rm-manual">Three North Korean Military Hackers Indicted in Wide-Ranging Scheme to Commit Cyberattacks and Financial Crimes Across the Globe</h1>
<p>Indictment Expands 2018 Case that Detailed Attack on Sony Pictures 
and Creation of WannaCry Ransomware by Adding Two New Defendants and 
Recent Global Schemes to Steal Money and Cryptocurrency from Banks and 
Businesses while Operating in North Korea, China</p>
<p>Note: <a href="file:///opa/video/three-north-korean-military-hackers-indicted-scheme-commit-cyberattacks-and-financial">Audio </a>and <a href="file:///opa/page/file/1369691/download">Transcript </a>of the February 17, 2021 press call is available on our videos page.</p>
<p>A federal indictment unsealed today charges three North Korean 
computer programmers with participating in a wide-ranging criminal 
conspiracy to conduct a series of destructive cyberattacks, to steal and
 extort more than $1.3 billion of money and cryptocurrency from 
financial institutions and companies, to create and deploy multiple 
malicious cryptocurrency applications, and to develop and fraudulently 
market a blockchain platform.</p>
<p>A second case unsealed today revealed that a Canadian-American 
citizen has agreed to plead guilty in a money laundering scheme and 
admitted to being a high-level money launderer for multiple criminal 
schemes, including ATM “cash-out” operations and a cyber-enabled bank 
heist orchestrated by North Korean hackers.</p>
<p>“As laid out in today’s indictment, North Korea’s operatives, using 
keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency 
instead of sacks of cash, are the world’s leading bank robbers,” said 
Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers of the Justice Department’s 
National Security Division. “The Department will continue to confront 
malicious nation state cyber activity with our unique tools and work 
with our fellow agencies and the family of norms abiding nations to do 
the same.”</p>
<p>“Today's unsealed indictment expands upon the FBI’s 2018 charges for 
the unprecedented cyberattacks conducted by the North Korean regime,” 
said the FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. “The ongoing targeting, 
compromise, and cyber-enabled theft by North Korea from global victims 
was met with the outstanding, persistent investigative efforts of the 
FBI in close collaboration with U.S. and international partners. By 
arresting facilitators, seizing funds, and charging those responsible 
for the hacking conspiracy, the FBI continues to impose consequences and
 hold North Korea accountable for its criminal cyber activity."</p>
<p>“The scope of the criminal conduct by the North Korean hackers was 
extensive and long-running, and the range of crimes they have committed 
is staggering,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison for the 
Central District of California. “The conduct detailed in the indictment 
are the acts of a criminal nation-state that has stopped at nothing to 
extract revenge and obtain money to prop up its regime.”</p>
<p>“This case is a particularly striking example of the growing alliance
 between officials within some national governments and highly 
sophisticated cyber-criminals,” said U.S. Secret Service Assistant 
Director Michael R. D’Ambrosio. “The individuals indicted today 
committed a truly unprecedented range of financial and cyber-crimes: 
from ransomware attacks and phishing campaigns, to digital bank heists 
and sophisticated money laundering operations. With victims strewn 
across the globe, this case shows yet again that the challenge of 
cybercrime is, and will continue to be, a struggle that can only be won 
through partnerships, perseverance, and a relentless focus on holding 
criminals accountable.”</p>
<p>The hacking indictment filed in the U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles alleges that Jon Chang Hyok (전창혁), 31; Kim Il (김일), 27; and Park
 Jin Hyok (박진혁), 36, were members of units of the Reconnaissance General
 Bureau (RGB), a military intelligence agency of the Democratic People’s
 Republic of Korea (DPRK), which engaged in criminal hacking. These 
North Korean military hacking units are known by multiple names in the 
cybersecurity community, including Lazarus Group and Advanced Persistent
 Threat 38 (APT38). Park was previously charged in a <a href="file:///opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and">criminal complaint</a> unsealed in September 2018. </p>
<p>The indictment alleges a broad array of criminal cyber activities 
undertaken by the conspiracy, in the United States and abroad, for 
revenge or financial gain. The schemes alleged include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cyberattacks on the Entertainment Industry: The destructive 
cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014 in 
retaliation for “The Interview,” a movie that depicted a fictional 
assassination of the DPRK’s leader; the December 2014 targeting of AMC 
Theatres, which was scheduled to show the film; and a 2015 intrusion 
into Mammoth Screen, which was producing a fictional series involving a 
British nuclear scientist taken prisoner in DPRK.</li> <li>Cyber-Enabled
 Heists from Banks: Attempts from 2015 through 2019 to steal more than 
$1.2 billion from banks in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Mexico, Malta, 
and Africa by hacking the banks’ computer networks and sending 
fraudulent Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication 
(SWIFT) messages.</li> <li>Cyber-Enabled ATM Cash-Out Thefts: Thefts 
through ATM cash-out schemes – referred to by the U.S. government as 
“FASTCash” – including the October 2018 theft of $6.1 million from 
BankIslami Pakistan Limited (BankIslami).</li> <li>Ransomware and 
Cyber-Enabled Extortion: Creation of the destructive WannaCry 2.0 
ransomware in May 2017, and the extortion and attempted extortion of 
victim companies from 2017 through 2020 involving the theft of sensitive
 data and deployment of other ransomware.</li> <li>Creation and 
Deployment of Malicious Cryptocurrency Applications: Development of 
multiple malicious cryptocurrency applications from March 2018 through 
at least September 2020 – including Celas Trade Pro, WorldBit-Bot, 
iCryptoFx, Union Crypto Trader, Kupay Wallet, CoinGo Trade, Dorusio, 
CryptoNeuro Trader, and Ants2Whale – which would provide the North 
Korean hackers a backdoor into the victims’ computers.</li> <li>Targeting
 of Cryptocurrency Companies and Theft of Cryptocurrency: Targeting of 
hundreds of cryptocurrency companies and the theft of tens of millions 
of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency, including $75 million from a 
Slovenian cryptocurrency company in December 2017; $24.9 million from an
 Indonesian cryptocurrency company in September 2018; and $11.8 million 
from a financial services company in New York in August 2020 in which 
the hackers used the malicious CryptoNeuro Trader application as a 
backdoor.</li> <li>Spear-Phishing Campaigns: Multiple spear-phishing 
campaigns from March 2016 through February 2020 that targeted employees 
of United States cleared defense contractors, energy companies, 
aerospace companies, technology companies, the U.S.Department of State, 
and the U.S. Department of Defense.</li> <li>Marine Chain Token and 
Initial Coin Offering: Development and marketing in 2017 and 2018 of the
 Marine Chain Token to enable investors to purchase fractional ownership
 interests in marine shipping vessels, supported by a blockchain, which 
would allow the DPRK to secretly obtain funds from investors, control 
interests in marine shipping vessels, and evade U.S. sanctions.</li> </ul>
<p>According to the allegations contained in the hacking indictment, 
which was filed on Dec. 8, 2020, in the U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles and unsealed today, the three defendants were members of units 
of the RGB who were at times stationed by the North Korean government in
 other countries, including China and Russia. While these defendants 
were part of RGB units that have been referred to by cybersecurity 
researchers as Lazarus Group and APT38, the indictment alleges that 
these groups engaged in a single conspiracy to cause damage, steal data 
and money, and otherwise further the strategic and financial interests 
of the DPRK government and its leader, Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>Money Launderer Charged in California and Georgia</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors today also unsealed a charge against Ghaleb 
Alaumary, 37, of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, for his role as a money 
launderer for the North Korean conspiracy, among other criminal schemes.
 Alaumary agreed to plead guilty to the charge, which was filed in the 
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Nov. 17, 2020. Alaumary was a 
prolific money launderer for hackers engaged in ATM cash-out schemes, 
cyber-enabled bank heists, business email compromise (BEC) schemes, and 
other online fraud schemes. Alaumary is also being prosecuted for his 
involvement in a separate BEC scheme by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for 
the Southern District of Georgia.</p>
<p>With respect to the North Korean co-conspirators’ activities, 
Alaumary organized teams of co-conspirators in the United States and 
Canada to launder millions of dollars obtained through ATM cash-out 
operations, including from BankIslami and a bank in India in 2018. 
Alaumary also conspired with Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, aka “Ray Hushpuppi,” 
and others to launder funds from a North Korean-perpetrated 
cyber-enabled heist from a Maltese bank in February 2019. Last summer, 
the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles <a href="file:///usao-cdca/pr/nigerian-national-brought-us-face-charges-conspiring-launder-hundreds-millions-dollars">charged Abbas in a separate case</a> alleging that he conspired to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from BEC frauds and other scams.</p>
<p>Accompanying Mitigation Efforts</p>
<p>Throughout the investigation, the FBI and the Justice Department 
provided specific information to victims about how they had been 
targeted or compromised, as well as information about the tactics, 
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the hackers with the goals of 
remediating any intrusion and preventing future intrusions. That direct 
sharing of information took place in the United States and in foreign 
countries, often with the assistance of foreign law enforcement 
partners. The FBI also collaborated with certain private cybersecurity 
companies by sharing and analyzing information about the intrusion TTPs 
used by the members of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>In addition to the criminal charges, the FBI and the Department of 
Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in
 collaboration with the U.S. Department of Treasury, today released a 
joint cybersecurity advisory and malware analysis reports (MARs) 
regarding North Korean cryptocurrency malware. The joint cybersecurity 
analysis and MARs highlight the cyber threat North Korea – which is 
referred to by the U.S. government as HIDDEN COBRA – poses to 
cryptocurrency and identify malware and indicators of compromise related
 to the “AppleJeus” family of malware (the name given by the 
cybersecurity community to a family of North Korean malicious 
cryptocurrency applications that includes Celas Trade Pro, WorldBit-Bot,
 Union Crypto Trader, Kupay Wallet, CoinGo Trade, Dorusio, CryptoNeuro 
Trader, and Ants2Whale). The joint cybersecurity advisory and MARs 
collectively provide the cybersecurity community and public with 
information about identifying North Korean malicious cryptocurrency 
applications, avoiding intrusions, and remedying infections.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney’s Office and FBI also obtained seizure warrants 
authorizing the FBI to seize cryptocurrency stolen by the North Korean 
hackers from a victim in the indictment – a financial services company 
in New York – held at two cryptocurrency exchanges. The seizures include
 sums of multiple cryptocurrencies totaling approximately $1.9 million, 
which will ultimately be returned to the victim.</p>
<p>Jon, Kim, and Park are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit
 computer fraud and abuse, which carries a maximum sentence of five 
years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 
bank fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.</p>
<p>In relation to the case filed in Los Angeles, Alaumary has agreed to 
plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, 
which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations and 
the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty 
beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>The investigation of Jon, Kim, and Park was led by the FBI’s Los 
Angeles Field Office, which worked closely with the FBI’s Charlotte 
Field Office. The U.S. Secret Service’s Los Angeles Field Office and 
Global Investigative Operations Center provided substantial assistance. 
The FBI’s Cyber Division also provided substantial assistance.</p>
<p>The investigations of Alaumary were conducted by the U.S. Secret 
Service’s Savannah Field Office, FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, and the
 U.S. Secret Service’s Los Angeles Field Office and Global Investigative
 Operations Center. The FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division also 
provided substantial assistance.</p>
<p>The case against Jon, Kim, and Park is being prosecuted by Assistant 
U.S. Attorneys Anil J. Antony and Khaldoun Shobaki of the Cyber and 
Intellectual Property Crimes Section, with substantial assistance from 
Trial Attorney Scott Claffee of the Department of Justice National 
Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Antony and Shobaki are also prosecuting the 
case against Alaumary, in which the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the 
Southern District of Georgia and the Criminal Division’s Computer Crimes
 and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) provided substantial 
assistance. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Antony and Shobaki, along with 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Galatzan of the Asset Forfeiture 
Section, also obtained the seizure warrants for cryptocurrency stolen 
from the financial services company in New York.</p>
<p>The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs provided 
assistance throughout these investigations, as did many of the FBI’s 
Legal Attachés, as well as foreign authorities around the world. 
Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance.</p>
