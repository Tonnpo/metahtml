<p>SAN ANTONIO — For Christian Gutierrez, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/10/coronavirus-texas-poses-challenges-people-without-insurance/">preparing for a coronavirus outbreak</a> is as much a financial consideration as it is a health one.</p>
<p>At what point should the Houston-area Latin dance instructor cancel 
his classes and forego his bread-and-butter income? If he feels sick 
with flu-like symptoms, should he take the over-the-counter cough 
medicine he’s stocked up on, or should he pay out of pocket to see a 
doctor about COVID-19 testing?</p>
<p>Gutierrez, 40, is one of roughly 5 million Texans who don’t have health insurance. Texas has the highest share of <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-267.pdf">uninsured residents</a> of any state, with nearly 18% of people lacking health coverage, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>“People, sometimes, when they cannot afford health care or access to 
health care, they most likely are wanting to treat themselves at home or
 not go see the doctor because of the cost itself,” Gutierrez said. 
“You’ve still got to pay the mortgage, you’ve still got to pay the car 
bill and all the other things just associated with living.”</p>
<p>Public health experts say the state’s uniquely large uninsured 
population is complicating efforts to contain the disease because 
financial constraints could prevent millions of people from seeing 
doctors to get tested or treated — or could make it difficult for them 
to stay home from work even if they feel ill.</p>
<p>With the number of known cases of coronavirus infection in the U.S. 
surpassing 500 this weekend, a growing chorus of experts is warning 
about the vulnerability of millions of Americans who lack health care 
and are unable to take paid sick time off of work. Texas, where 
Republican leaders have for years <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/02/27/texas-medicaid-expansion-would-help-homeless-advocates-say/">opposed expanding</a> state-funded health insurance coverage to the poor, is home to a disproportionate share of them.</p>
<p>“One of the greatest challenges ahead is to make sure that the 
burdens of COVID-19, and our response measures, do not fall unfairly on 
people in society who are vulnerable because of their economic, social, 
or health status,” nearly 800 scientists, doctors and lawyers recently 
wrote in an <a href="https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/center/ghjp/documents/final_covid-19_letter_from_public_health_and_legal_experts.pdf">open letter</a> to the Trump administration.</p>
<p>It is “critical for policymakers to ensure comprehensive and 
affordable access to testing, including for the uninsured,” the experts 
wrote. “Control efforts will be less effective if some fail to seek 
appropriate diagnosis or care due to large out-of-pocket costs or 
copays.”</p>

<p>That complicates public officials’ and health care workers’ ability 
to respond to an infectious disease epidemic in several ways. Most 
immediately, people without health insurance appear less likely to get 
tested.</p>
<p>“As the coronavirus spreads, health coverage, access, and 
affordability issues are going to become more pronounced,” Larry Levitt,
 the Kaiser Family Foundation’s executive vice president for health 
policy, <a href="https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/1236306627076079616?s=20">wrote</a> Saturday.</p>
<p>“How do people who are uninsured or underinsured afford not only 
testing, but treatment too?” he wrote. “It will expose the inadequacies 
and inequalities in our health system.”</p>
<h3>Testing capacity limited in Texas</h3>
<p>Ten public health labs in Texas are operational or soon coming online
 to test nose and throat swabs for the presence of genetic material from
 the new strain of the coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2. (COVID-19 is 
the disease caused by the virus.) The U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention has said that anyone can receive a test for the virus as 
long as a doctor agrees.</p>
<p>A problem for Texas, experts said, is that a significant portion of 
its massive uninsured population likely does not have a primary care 
doctor to make that call.</p>
<p>And the state’s testing capacity is limited. Texas officials <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/05/texas-coronavirus-tests-capacity-remains-limited-labs-are-running/">said</a>
 last week that the largest public health lab could handle a maximum of 
26 tests per day. Federal guidance recommended that doctors “use their 
judgment” when deciding if a patient merits testing and said they should
 consider symptoms as well as travel history and the possibility of 
close contact with people who tested positive for the coronavirus 
disease.</p>
<p>In San Antonio, where hundreds of cruise ship passengers and other 
travelers have been sent for quarantine at Lackland Air Force Base, 
Mayor Ron Nirenberg <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/09/san-antonio-mayor-calm-coronavirus-fears-says-city-needs-more-tests/">said</a> this week that his city "needs a heck of a lot more testing, and we're requesting that ASAP."</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence, picked by President Donald Trump to lead the federal government’s response to the disease, has <a href="https://apnews.com/0be2e3b52733ec84aadb201ab9555230">said</a>
 it will be “weeks” before testing becomes widely available to the 
public, as it is in other affected countries such as South Korea.</p>
<p>Insufficient testing — particularly among uninsured Texans — could 
hamper the government's understanding of the scope of an outbreak.</p>
<p>“Any social, political, health-related pressure that makes people 
less likely to talk to people in charge about the fact that they might 
be infected significantly reduces the effectiveness and efficiency of an
 outbreak investigation,” said Dennis Perrotta, a former Texas state 
epidemiologist.</p>
<p>And then there are challenges for public health officials working to 
contain the spread of the virus, especially when it comes to convincing 
people to stay home if they're possibly infected with the virus. State 
leaders have said there is not yet evidence of person-to-person COVID-19
 spread within Texas but that it is likely to happen in the coming 
weeks.</p>
<p>“Can they afford to lose five days at work, or do they just not tell 
anybody about it and hope that they’re not sick? That’s an integral part
 and a bad part of what we face in outbreak investigations,” Perrotta 
said.</p>
<p>Rodney Rohde, an infectious disease expert at Texas State University,
 said that the strategy of infectious disease containment can only be 
effective at the beginning of an outbreak. “If you don’t get it done in 
the first 30 days or less, you’re just not going to contain it,” he 
said. “This is not abnormal. This is what [viruses] do.”</p>
<p>Another challenge, according to health care workers, is that people 
without health insurance are more likely to get medical care in the 
emergency room. Public health experts expect that, in the event of 
widespread outbreak, the nation’s emergency hospital care system will be
 spread extremely thin, as has happened in Wuhan, China.</p>
<p>And if significant numbers of health care workers fall ill, it will tax emergency department resources even further. An <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130">early study</a>
 of Chinese data found that roughly 4% of coronavirus cases occurred in 
health care workers, with 15% of those infected workers having cases 
classified as “severe or critical,” including five deaths.</p>
<p>Asked last week what steps uninsured people should take to confront 
the coronavirus, Texas Department of State Health Services Commissioner 
John Hellerstedt said they should avoid going to the emergency room for 
non-urgent care and encouraged them to call a <a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/">help line</a> to find nearby free or reduced-cost clinics.</p>
<p>“If you’re not clinically ill, there ought to be ways to arrange in 
advance to get people seen at a variety of resources that exist all over
 the state,” he said.</p>
<p>Patrik Hornak, a resident in internal medicine at the University of 
Texas Medical Branch who signed on to the expert letter to the Trump 
administration, said he’s worried that financial pressures on 
low-income, uninsured patients may keep them from seeking health care or
 self-isolating if they become contagious.</p>
<p>“Those are patients that are likely to have a lower-paying job and 
might have other economic stressors at home, they have kids they need to
 get food on the table for,” he said. “Imagine somebody who’s working at
 a drive-through window at a fast food restaurant and they come down 
with coronavirus, they’re coming in contact with 1,000 people a day.”</p>
<p>Gutierrez considers himself lucky; he has some savings he can dip 
into if he has to briefly shut down his small business. “But for me it’s
 of course scary because I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m 
infected and I have to really deal with it,” he said. “In the worst-case
 scenario, I’ll have to go to the hospital no matter what the cost is.”</p>
<h3>Who pays?</h3>
<p>As of Monday, 13 people in the general Texas population had tested 
positive for the virus. An additional 11 people repatriated from 
overseas were quarantined at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio and 
tested positive. Texas health officials have urged people so far to take
 individual preventive measures such as hand-washing, covering coughs 
and sneezes, and staying home when sick. Government-imposed quarantines 
and other <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/05/texas-coronavirus-response-what-state-officials-can-do/">interventions</a> have been limited so far.</p>
<p>But experts say the number of cases will likely grow exponentially as
 community transmission becomes a reality in wide swaths of the country.</p>
<p>“As the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the U.S.
 will, at some point in time, either this year or next, be exposed to 
this virus, and there’s a good chance many will become sick,” Nancy 
Messonier, a respiratory disease expert for the U.S. Centers for Disease
 Control and Prevention, told reporters Monday. “But again, based on 
what we know about this virus, we do not expect most people to develop 
serious illness.”</p>
<p>Hornak said he'd like to see the state take a more aggressive 
approach to make flu vaccines and tests widely available. It’s peak flu 
season, and both COVID-19 and seasonal flu are respiratory illnesses 
that present similarly and strain hospital capacity, he said.</p>
<p>“A lot of flu patients end up in the ICU,” he said. “If ICU beds are 
going to be at a premium, and ventilators and staffing, the more that we
 can do to keep other preventable diseases at bay I think is a really 
wise strategy.”</p>
<p>That presents another important consideration for policymakers: Who 
pays when uninsured patients need emergency coronavirus treatment?</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal, citing an anonymous official, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-considering-paying-hospitals-for-treating-uninsured-coronavirus-patients-11583258943">reported</a>
 last week that the Trump administration is considering using a national
 disaster program to pay doctors and hospitals for their care of 
uninsured patients with COVID-19. The payments would be at 110% of the 
rate that Medicare pays.</p>
<p>“We are going to look at the uninsured because they have a big problem,” Trump said last week.</p>
<p>Texas hospitals say they’re still waiting on specifics but are 
bracing for "one of the heaviest lifts of our time," a trade association
 spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>"We want to give people the peace of mind that we’re here for all 
Texans, but this is going to require an incredible amount of resources,"
 said Carrie Williams, a Texas Hospital Association spokeswoman. "With 
the uninsured, the tone from the federal government seems to be that 
these costs will be covered, but it’s unclear exactly how that’s going 
to work, and we’re encouraging hospitals to closely track their COVID-19
 costs.”</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers passed an $8 billion emergency <a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200302/BILLS-116hr6074-SUS.pdf">funding package</a> to help pay for vaccine development, among other priorities, but it did not appear to specifically address hospital payments.</p>
<p>Dana Hendrick of Colorado City in West Texas became uninsured after 
she retired from her job at a nearby prison. She said she is unable to 
afford routine medical care and does not know what she would do if she 
contracted the virus.</p>
<p>“I have a barely livable retirement wage,” she said. “It’s just not nearly enough to pay for decent insurance coverage.”</p>
<p>Her parents, who live nearby, are in their 80s — Hendrick, 58, said 
her mother “falls a lot” — and they depend on her for regular help. 
She’s worried about what would happen to them if she needed to 
self-quarantine.</p>
<p>“I don’t know that we’re handling it as a country as effectively as we should be,” she said.</p>
