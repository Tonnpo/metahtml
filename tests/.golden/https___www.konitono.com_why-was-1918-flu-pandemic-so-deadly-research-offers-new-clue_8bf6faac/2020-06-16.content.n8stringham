<p class="rm-manual">November 29, 1999 by <a href="file:///go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjc2MDYwLnBocA==">www.medicalnewstoday.com</a> </p>
<p class="">In 1918, as one global devastation in the shape of World War
 I came to an end, people around the world found themselves facing 
another deadly enemy, pandemic flu. The virus killed more than 50 
million people, three times the number that fell in the Great War, and 
did this so much faster than any other illness in recorded history. But 
why was that particular pandemic so deadly? Where did the virus come 
from and why was it so severe? These questions have dogged scientists 
ever since. Now, a new study led by the University of Arizona (UA) may 
have solved the mystery. Michael Worobey, a professor in UA College of 
Science’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and colleagues
 describe their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences. They hope the study not only offers some new clues about the 
deadliness of the 1918 pandemic, but will also help improve strategies 
for vaccination and pandemic prevention, as Prof. Worobey explains: “If 
our model is correct, then current medical interventions, especially 
antibiotics and vaccines, against several pneumonia-causing bacteria, 
could be expected to dramatically reduce mortality, if we were faced 
today with a similar set of pandemic ingredients.”… <a href="file:///go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjc2MDYwLnBocA==" rel="nofollow">Read full this story</a></p>
