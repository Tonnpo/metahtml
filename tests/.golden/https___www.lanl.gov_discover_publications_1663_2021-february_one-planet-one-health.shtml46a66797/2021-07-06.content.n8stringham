 Biologist Jeanne Fair knows that the way to anticipate pandemics is 
through understanding the connections between humans, animals, and the 
environment. </p>
<p>Last February, when COVID-19 was just beginning to visibly emerge 
from China, I was asked to participate in a Laboratory panel discussion 
about the spread of this novel coronavirus and what it might mean for 
the United States. Having studied emerging zoonotic diseases for 25 
years, I knew the outlook was troublesome, but I was still optimistic. I
 had a good idea of the extensive disruption that was coming our way, 
and yet, when the situation escalated dramatically a month later, I 
still found it hard to believe and harbored a strong sense of denial. </p>
<p>Anytime I’ve given a public lecture on emerging diseases and 
pandemics, I have shared a photo of a gravestone in Kansas that belongs 
to my great-aunt, Margret Ann Fair, who died of the 1918 influenza at 
the age of four. I often read her obituary to make the point that likely
 everyone in the room has an ancestor in their family tree who died 
during the 1918 pandemic. Like most researchers who study emerging 
infectious diseases, I always said that it was not a question of “if” a 
new disease could become a pandemic; it was instead a question of 
“when.” </p>
<p>And yet, there are days that I still can’t believe it is actually happening to us right now. </p>
<h3>How did we know?</h3>
<p>The reason I said it’s a question of “when” is because it is not 
uncommon for new diseases to emerge. Pathogens that can infect multiple 
species—such as rabies, influenza, and Ebola—are everywhere. Infectious 
diseases frequently spill over from animals to humans and vice versa, 
but we don’t always notice. Sometimes the pathogen is not particularly 
virulent, meaning it does not cause severe disease. Other times a 
pathogen may infect a “dead-end host”—one that does not transmit the 
pathogen further. </p>
<p>The key to a spillover becoming an international crisis is a 
combination of transmissibility and virulence. Avian flu (H5N1), for 
example, is extremely virulent and can make a person deathly ill in a 
short amount of time, killing about half of the humans it infects. This 
is scary, but with known pathogens of pandemic potential there has often
 been a tradeoff between virulence and transmissibility. The H5N1 avian 
influenza virus attacks us deep in the lungs and therefore is not as 
transmissible as seasonal influenza, which replicates more in the upper 
respiratory system. On the other hand, common colds—many of which are 
caused by coronaviruses—are extremely transmissible but not very 
virulent. </p>
<blockquote> Infectious diseases frequently spill over from animals to humans and vice versa, but we don’t always notice. </blockquote>
<p>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in 2002, is a
 deadly disease caused by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This 
was the first severe and readily transmissible disease to emerge in many
 decades; it quickly spread to more than 20 countries, infected about 
8000 people, and killed 774. In 2012, a related coronavirus emerged as a
 much more deadly disease. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 
(MERS-CoV) infected about 2500 people and caused 858 deaths. 
Fortunately, MERS was also not particularly transmissible and was 
quickly controlled. </p>
<p>Today’s pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is closely related to 
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but it had the correct mix of transmissibility 
and virulence to take the world by storm. With SARS-CoV-2 there are no 
tradeoffs: it is easily transmitted between people and it is very deadly
 in some. But it is that extreme variability in the disease 
characteristics and virulence in humans that adds to the perfect storm. 
SARS-CoV-2 can take from five short days to two entire weeks to incubate
 in a host before it causes coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19 for 
short. But in some people, it never shows itself. Many who are infected 
with SARS-CoV-2 do not experience any symptoms (they are asymptomatic) 
or experience only mild symptoms—but they can still transmit the virus. 
The potentially long incubation period and pre-symptomatic or 
asymptomatic spread are some of the reasons this virus is so serious and
 also so complicated. All of this variation in the disease and 
transmission leads to variation in human behavior and in our response to
 the pandemic. This variation is something we are all witnessing every 
day. </p>
<p>It is not possible to predict exactly when a mutation will happen to 
make a pathogen pandemic-worthy or to anticipate when a spillover will 
occur. However, scientists know there are situations that can increase 
the likelihood of a spillover event, such as changes to the environment 
and climate or significant interactions between humans and wildlife 
(e.g., eating bushmeat or going to live meat markets). Scientists have 
combined these attributes to predict hotspot areas for emerging 
diseases. There is also a lot that we do know that can help with 
prediction. If we know which specific pathogens have pandemic potential,
 and which animals harbor those pathogens—we call them disease 
reservoirs—then we can monitor them as part of our global 
biosurveillance effort.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated in bats. Bats and humans—and other 
animals like cats—have angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) attached 
to the outsides of their nasal, lung, and kidney cells. These ACE2 
enzymes normally serve as docking stations for a protein called 
angiotensin that helps regulate blood pressure, wound healing, and 
inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 as a way to gain entry into 
cells. This is how diseases can jump between species: if humans share 
certain receptor molecules with animals, then pathogens that use those 
receptors can spread to humans. </p>
<figcaption>In some parts of the world, people buy food from live meat 
markets, including bats and other wildlife. Wildlife in cages in these 
“wet markets” are under stress, which makes them more vulnerable to 
disease than they might be in the wild. Wet markets are one way that 
animal diseases can spill over into humans. </figcaption><p>Humans in 
some cultures eat wildlife, and often keep them in live meat markets 
where refrigeration is not possible. Wild animals in cages in these “wet
 markets” are under stress, which makes them more vulnerable to disease 
than they might be in the wild. And this is how spillover happens: a 
person is exposed to an infected animal and if the pathogen has new 
mutations or is novel to that person’s immune system—and if it has the 
ability to dock and enter the person’s cells—the emergent pathogen could
 infect the person. If this happens, the pathogen could thus take hold 
in a new species.</p>
<p>The “One Health” paradigm is the concept that the environment, wild 
animals, agriculture animals, humans, and pathogens are interconnected. 
It is important to understand each of these compartments and their 
connections to ensure the health of all populations on the planet. </p>
<p>The ecology of infectious diseases is something I have been studying 
for the last 25 years. I have been fortunate to have met the top 
scientists around the world who study infectious diseases and spillover 
events. These researchers are some of the most dedicated and hardworking
 scientists anywhere, and their efforts are now focused on helping the 
global community understand why this pandemic happened and what to do 
before the next one.</p>
<h3>Canaries aren’t the only harbingers</h3>
<p>I first came to Los Alamos to do my graduate work on western 
bluebirds. I became interested in zoology as an undergraduate—giving up 
my previous plans to study bass violin—when I realized I just couldn’t 
stop thinking about the natural world. During my time as a graduate 
student at Colorado State University I worked on a United States 
Department of Agriculture project on the impact of insecticides on 
birds. I became interested in toxicology and understanding the effect 
chemicals have on the immune system and other physiological processes 
that make an animal more susceptible to infectious disease. </p>
<blockquote> SARS-CoV-2 had the correct mix of transmissibility and virulence to take the world by storm. </blockquote>
<p>My graduate work with the Environmental Restoration project at the 
Lab was an opportunity to set up a network of nestboxes across the 
Pajarito Plateau (upon which Los Alamos sits) with which to study wild 
bird individuals and populations. We wanted to determine if stresses 
such as legacy environmental pollution, food limitation, habitat 
changes, or climate shifts were impacting the birds in the region. With 
the nestboxes, we could take physiological measurements of the birds 
that were surviving and breeding, but to thoroughly answer our questions
 we needed a way to measure the birds’ immune systems. The year 2020 was
 the 24th field season for the Los Alamos Nestbox Network (now operated 
by the Lab’s Environmental Stewardship Group), and I am grateful to the 
teams of students and staff who have dedicated their time and passion 
into keeping this project going. As it turns out, long-term studies are 
how we can answer these difficult questions. </p>
<p>One of the things that attracted me to Los Alamos—and kept me here—is
 the innovation in biotechnology and modeling. For example, the 
invention of flow cytometry (a tool for evaluating and sorting cells) 
and the seminal work in genomic sequencing both happened here. I saw an 
opportunity to apply these tools to novel systems, such as wildlife and 
infectious-disease surveillance. My colleagues Kirsten McCabe, Babetta 
Marrone, and I worked to develop flow cytometry-based immunological 
assays to detect antibodies in different species of birds because most 
tests had been developed for chickens and wouldn’t work on other 
species. In 2003, when New Mexico was hit the hardest by West Nile 
Virus, we lost 98 percent of the black-billed magpies in the Pojoaque 
valley below Los Alamos. This project led us to explore a central 
question to understanding infectious diseases: Why are some species 
susceptible while others are dead-end hosts? </p>
<p>Species susceptibility is one aspect of studying emerging diseases, 
as it helps focus surveillance efforts on the appropriate animal 
populations. Furthermore, it is critical to appreciate all the factors 
that can make an animal stressed, which also adds to its susceptibility.
 Stress is a physiological response in the body, and some stress 
hormones, like cortisol, are known to suppress parts of the immune 
system, such as the inflammatory response. Being in a cage at a wet 
market is one source of stress for an animal, but there are many others.
 Deforestation and other human activities lead to habitat loss, forcing 
animals to move to new areas where they may face food insecurity or new 
predators. Biodiversity in areas around the world is a good index of a 
healthy system; it is often inversely related to the occurences of 
emerging zoonotic diseases and outbreaks. Environmental changes, 
especially to the climate, can also lead to forced migration of animals.
 Finally, environmental pollution, as we have long been studying in Los 
Alamos, can be a source of stress if it causes damage to animals’ immune
 systems or reproductive systems. </p>
<figcaption>Studying wing feathers is an important part of disease 
biosurveillance in birds to assess their health, condition, and age. 
This is valuable for building population models for species and for 
assessing the impacts of mass mortality events and the relative risk of 
new spillover diseases. <span>Jeanne Fair/LANL</span></figcaption><p>Using
 the Los Alamos Nestbox Network, our results showed that legacy 
environmental contamination had little impact on the birds. However, we 
observed large impact to the birds from habitat changes. The increased 
temperatures in Northern New Mexico and resulting tree die-off at lower 
elevations forced the birds to move to higher elevations. Furthermore, 
in the drought year of 2002, nestling bluebirds had half the immune 
system capacity compared to a normal year. </p>
<p>Recently, we observed an example of multiple stresses combining to 
cause a mass wild-bird mortality event. In September 2020, an estimated 
one million birds died in New Mexico and southern Colorado, where they 
had been experiencing a combination of drought, wildfire smoke, and 
weather extremes (temperatures close to 100 degrees Fahrenheit one day 
and snow two days later). Because of this event, we are creating a 
Southwest Avian Health Network to connect ornithologists in New Mexico 
to those in neighboring states.</p>
<p>As my work progressed over the years, I began to focus my attention 
on measuring other signatures in birds to help with assessing disease 
susceptibility. Some of my studies focused on a sugar molecule called 
sialic acid, which is the receptor for influenzas. Knowing that avian 
influenza is highly pathogenic in chickens but causes minimal disease in
 other bird species, we sought to determine if different birds have 
varied amounts of sialic acid, which could make some more susceptible, 
or even superspreaders, of disease. In a recent publication, we 
demonstrated that sialic acid does indeed differ among bird species and 
that some blood cells in birds had more human-type sialic acid than 
expected. This is an important finding for birds, since sialic acid is 
also a receptor for the parasite Plasmodium, which causes malaria in 
birds and humans.</p>
<h3>So many systems</h3>
<p>To this day, I continue my work studying bird species’ susceptibility
 to disease and biosurveillance in animals. However, in 2004 I also 
began broadening my scope and looking at pandemic modeling as part of a 
Department of Homeland Security project on H5N1 avian influenza. Our 
project focused on modeling the impact of a pandemic on critical 
infrastructures. We looked at hospital capacities, the impacts of 
closing schools and limiting contacts, and the effectiveness of 
targeting treatments if available. (With influenza, we knew that Tamiflu
 could help but that we would have limited doses.) In 2009, we were part
 of a multi-team effort at the Laboratory using several of our 
epidemiological models to predict the impacts of different scenarios for
 pharmaceutical and vaccine interventions for the spreading H1N1 
influenza (“swine flu”) pandemic. It was exciting to work with the 
amazing scientists and epidemiologists at Los Alamos, and it was a true 
collaborative effort. </p>
<blockquote> This pandemic is transformative, pushing science and collaborations to their highest potential. </blockquote>
<p>It was during my eight years with this critical infrastructure 
modeling team at Los Alamos, and with two Laboratory-directed 
exploratory research projects for understanding both West Nile Virus and
 avian influenza host heterogeneity, that I fell in love with scientific
 collaboration. While the science was engaging and interesting, it was 
collaboration with my colleagues that most excited me. I began to seek 
out information to learn how to make collaborations better and how to 
foster collaborations between my fellow researchers. I became enthralled
 with the emerging field of the “science of team science” and what makes
 transformative science teams. I sought everything I could read on 
leadership, communication, and teamwork. This interest would pay off 
later when I did an assignment in Virginia as a Biological Threat 
Reduction Program (BTRP) Science Manager with the Defense Threat 
Reduction Agency. </p>
<p>Although genomic sequencing technology was advancing at a rapid pace 
in the early 2000s, enabling scientists to evaluate the blueprints of 
organisms and thoroughly understand how they are related and how they 
differ, its full potential could only be realized via strong 
international partnerships. When it comes to pathogens, the genetic 
blueprint is vital, and current sequencing technology makes it possible 
to study a genome relatively quickly. As we see today with COVID-19, 
most testing is based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
 (RT-PCR), which matches pieces of the viral RNA from a patient to known
 SARS-CoV-2 sequences. </p>
<p>Accessing sequence data from around the world is critical to our 
ability to understand biological threats such as SARS-CoV-2 and others. 
This data availability, however, depends on two things: that other 
countries have the technology to provide such data and that we have 
cultivated relationships with them so that we can easily collaborate. In
 2011, Los Alamos began participating in two programs to promote 
international scientific engagement: the BTRP and the Department of 
State’s Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program. Through these 
programs, Los Alamos scientists have helped establish sequencing centers
 in multiple countries (including the Republic of Georgia, Jordan, 
Kenya, and Uganda), and my amazing colleagues continue to support more 
than 29 countries worldwide with ongoing sequencing and bioinformatics 
training. </p>
<figcaption>Los Alamos researchers have found that tree mortality in the
 Southwest is caused by a combination of drought, higher temperatures, 
and bark beetles. These habitat changes have been documented by Jeanne 
Fair and her team to have drastic consequences to bird populations, 
including impacting their immune systems and increasing their risk for 
carrying disease. Deforestation for agriculture and development all over
 the world also destroys animal habitats. Such circumstances can lead to
 pandemics when changes in habitat bring wild animals under stress into 
closer contact with humans. </figcaption><p>I believe these 
cooperative-engagement programs comprise some of the most important 
international efforts by the United States. In my role as a BTRP Science
 Manager (2013–2016), my job was to help the United States develop 
collaborations with partner countries to build their capabilities in 
detection, diagnostics, and reporting. As a result, biosurveillance and 
infectious disease technologies were strengthened in these partner 
countries, and we created strong, lasting relationships through 
scientific diplomacy and building trust between countries. Through this 
partnership, diagnostic laboratories around the world were better 
prepared to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide ample and 
accurate diagnostic testing for their citizens. </p>
<h3>When “if” becomes “now”</h3>
<p>It is strange to spend decades studying something you hope won’t 
happen, but here I am. This pandemic was accurately predicted—we knew 
the hotspots where a spillover would most likely occur, and we knew that
 coronaviruses could spill over. We also knew what to do: stamp it out 
when it starts, test, contact trace, and quarantine. Yet here we are. </p>
<p>Since February, I have spent my time focusing on two main areas. 
First, my colleagues and I are supporting our BTRP partner countries by 
sharing best practices both to improve COVID-19 sequencing and genomics 
in their local laboratories and to help feed the international databases
 with valuable sequences. Second, we reconvened our critical 
infrastructure modeling team, gave it a new name, and have been 
ferociously working on developing a modeling experiment to understand 
the uncertainty of the pandemic. Now called MEDIAN (Modeling Epidemics 
for Decision support with Infrastructure ANalysis), this 
systems-dynamics model includes a range of distributions for all aspects
 of what is going on, from disease characteristics (incubation, 
pre-symptomatic transmission, mortality rate) to the uncertainty of 
human behavior (quarantining, wearing masks, rates of contact tracing).</p>
<figcaption>The epidemic curves in the graph represent different 
scenarios for the region of Albuquerque, NM. Each scenario comprises 
multiple variables for controlling the pandemic—such as diagnostic 
testing time, false-negative rates, and fractions of individuals who 
were contact traced and quarantined. Scientists can then quantify the 
extent to which the variables are effective at lowering case numbers. 
Statistical analysis of the scenario data indicates that contact tracing
 and quarantining have a consistently large impact on slowing disease 
spread, although these countermeasures are difficult to implement 
effectively if a large fraction of cases are asymptomatic. The red line 
shows actual cases throughout New Mexico, which were kept down by the 
implementation of many strategies, including widespread contact tracing 
and testing. </figcaption><p>Using MEDIAN, we are looking to identify 
the most important factors contributing to the severity of the pandemic.
 Our model is not about predicting how many people will be infected 
tomorrow or will die next week—other Los Alamos models examine this 
important aspect. Instead our goal is to take into account the 
uncertainty and variability in the pandemic to help understand which 
things are driving its spread and where to focus our response. </p>
<p>This understanding is derived from specifically designed experiments 
where we evaluate various distributions and look for key correlations. 
For instance, we might design an experimental run that has a disease 
incubation period of 5–14 days, with a percentage range of 
pre-symptomatic transmission, an age distribution of mortality rates, 
and a few other variables, each with a lot of uncertainty. Then we can 
run 10,000 simulations overnight covering all the uncertainties and we 
get a spaghetti figure of epidemic curves that is not that helpful. 
However, once we have this spaghetti figure, we can use statistics to 
pull out the most important disease and mitigation variables driving the
 epidemic. For the COVID-19 effort, we are focusing on the role of 
diagnostic testing. This will help us investigate the different patterns
 associated with testing strategies. For instance, we are seeking to 
correlate the impact of mass testing with contact tracing and quarantine
 on the number of cases and deaths.</p>
<h3>One day at a time</h3>
<p>This is hard. There is still so much uncertainty with this pandemic, 
and it can be overwhelming. However, there is much we do know that can 
help us today and that will help us prepare for tomorrow and the next 
emerging disease. Our work on COVID-19 is immediate and critical, but 
the rest is still important. </p>
<figcaption>As part of her graduate work, Jeanne Fair set up a network 
of 400 nestboxes across the Pajarito Plateau. Taking samples from birds 
in these nests provides data about how stresses, such as environmental 
pollution, food limitation, habitat changes, and climate shifts, impact 
birds in the region. The year 2020 was the 24th season for the Los 
Alamos Nestbox Network. </figcaption><p>Our small lab group in 
Bioscience Division is looking at the big picture of emerging disease by
 taking into account all aspects, such as climate change, environmental 
change, biodiversity impacts, and plant pathogens, as part of our 
Ecological Health Security Lab. For example, understanding how long-term
 environmental change impacts future mosquito distributions and the 
infectious diseases they carry is one important aspect. To address this,
 we are part of a new Laboratory-directed project to couple Earth 
systems and epidemiological models; this infectious disease-climate team
 is a true collaboration across many directorates and divisions at Los 
Alamos. </p>
<p>Ecological health security is the epitome of a complex system. Our 
ecology is changing: our proximity to and relationships with animals are
 evolving, our climate is adjusting, and the plants and wildlife are 
adapting (or not). This pandemic will not be the last, but hopefully it 
will be the worst—because we will learn from it and prepare. The 
conditions are ripe for new diseases to catch us off guard, but we have 
the technology and the partnerships to respond. This moment is 
transformative, pushing science and collaborations to their highest 
potential. </p>
<p>I still have moments where the reality of COVID-19 hits me hard—we 
never thought it would be this bad. But I try to stay positive and be 
grateful each day for nature, for the people in my life, for living in 
our amazing state of New Mexico, and for my health. I also know that 
tough times never last, but tough people do! And to be honest, waking up
 with a pressing purpose in the morning can be a good thing. <span>LDRD</span></p>
