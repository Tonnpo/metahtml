<p>By the time Bobby Wilson met Wan Joon Kim, he’d been to 15 record stores.</p>
<p>It was 1994, and no one would stock his cassette, “Comin’ From 
Watts,” with raps Wilson had written in prison and recorded himself upon
 his release. Wilson had a daunting resume: a decade-long membership in 
the Grape Street Watts Crip gang; five years incarcerated for attempted 
murder; the prison nickname “Kill Kill.”</p>
<p>Just out on parole and desperate for money to support his wife and 
child, Wilson’s last stop was the Compton Fashion Center indoor swap 
meet.</p>
<p>Kim, the owner of the Cycadelic record stall, was in his 50s, spoke 
little English and liked classical music. But he stocked what sold: the 
music of young rappers who were chronicling the crack-and-gang-addled 
neighborhoods around them. He took a chance on Wilson. “I think he 
understood my struggle, more than anything,” said Wilson, 42. After all,
 “he’s in the heart of Compton.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-et-rappers-gone-soft-pg,0,4085568.photogallery">PHOTOS: Hip-hop gone Hollywood?</a></p>
<p>The cassette sold close to 15,000 copies over the next year. Wilson 
went on to become an underground rap star. Kim “gave me my shot,” said 
Wilson. “It saved my life.”</p>
<p>While the world knows of the major L.A. gangsta rap figures who 
helped popularize the raw urban genre two decades ago — Suge Knight, Dr.
 Dre, Ice Cube — a far less likely figure pushed the music long before 
most folks knew it existed. If it came straight outta Compton, the 
birthplace of gangsta rap, often it first went through Wan Joon Kim.</p>
<p>The L.A. riots of 1992 created an indelible image of Korean immigrant
 shop owners in urban neighborhoods often in conflict with their African
 American customers, but that was hardly the whole story. “Most of my 
customers were the gang-bangers and drug dealers, so I built a 
friendship with them,” said the now frail Kim, 79, in an interview 
interpreted by his son, Kirk. His son now runs the stall, selling Latin 
music to a changing demographic. Kim works there once a week. “They were
 good to me as I was good to them.”</p>
<p>New country, new sounds</p>
<p>Wan Joon Kim escaped his native North Korea in 1950, sailing down the
 coast to South Korea with his family in his father’s fishing boat. In 
1976, he and his wife, Boo Ja, and their three young children were among
 the first waves of immigrants who left South Korea for Los Angeles.</p>
<p>At first, Kim and his wife sold women’s hair clips and barrettes at 
outdoor swap meets around Southern California. While selling at the 
Roadium Open Air Market in Torrance, Kim noticed that the man selling 
records always had a line.</p>
<p>Then in 1985, a few Korean swap-meet vendors leased an empty Sears 
building in Compton, partitioned it, and renamed it Compton Fashion 
Center — thus inventing the indoor swap meet in Southern California, 
said Edward Chang, a UC Riverside ethnic studies professor, who has 
researched swap meets in the Korean business community. Later, dozens of
 indoor swap meets opened, virtually all of them Korean-owned, and 
became malls for the inner city. Their stalls were the doors through 
which thousands of new Korean immigrants entered the L.A. business 
world, without bank loans.</p>
<p>Kim was selling barrettes at an outdoor swap meet one day when “the 
owners were coming around to individual vendors, saying they were going 
to open a bigger, nicer place,” he said.</p>
<p>Kim envisioned it as an easier way of doing business than traveling 
every day to a new swap meet, so he was third in line when Compton 
Fashion Center began leasing to vendors. He chose Stall Z-7, the spot 
nearest the building’s main entrance, with a monthly rent of $500.</p>
<p>A wholesaler suggested he sell the R&amp;B;, gospel, funk and rap 
coming from New York, though he eventually developed an ear for black 
music — and his own customers’ tastes — aided by his second daughter, 
Jinna Grace, who worked at the store and spoke English. When a song hit 
the radio, he drove quickly to wholesalers and had it in the store 
within hours.</p>
<p>Kim opened for business just as crack invaded Compton. Gunplay ruled 
the streets. “Several shootings happened here,” Kim said, indicating the
 entrance to the swap meet.</p>
<p>But amid the chaos, a hive of kids were mixing tapes in cramped 
apartments and garages, rapping and sampling like famous New York 
rappers. “They didn’t know nothing about signing to a record label, so 
they made music for their own neighborhood,” said Arlandis Hinton, who 
grew up in Compton and raps as BG Knocc Out. “That’s where they took it,
 to the Compton swap meet. He was like their first distributor.”</p>
<p>Its themes of drug dealing and the thug life made gangsta rap 
intensely controversial, and many record stores wouldn’t touch it at 
first. But it met about the only criteria that mattered in the 
microcapitalist world of the indoor swap meet: It sold.</p>
<p>Traffic and sales skyrocketed. Compton rappers delivered him new 
product constantly, and he became known to them all as “Pops” and his 
wife as “Mama.” Gangsta rap paid for the Kim daughters’ classical piano 
lessons, as the family moved from Koreatown to Gardena, then to Orange 
County.</p>
<p>“Everyone from everywhere was coming — artists and customers. People 
from Riverside, Pasadena,” Kim said. “Since wholesalers were so close, 
any time a song came on the radio people would come by real fast. I 
would drive and get it and sell it that day. We didn’t have to order and
 wait for shipping.”</p>
<p>Eric “Eazy-E” Wright, who started Ruthless Records to record his raps
 and that of his seminal group, N.W.A, would bring Kim his 12-inch 
singles. Boo Ja Kim treated rappers like her children and would scold: 
“Eric, pull your pants up!”</p>
<p>Changing with the times</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the black population began leaving Compton. Gangsta rap
 also left the confines of the city to become an international genre. 
Wright died of AIDS. Crack and gang shootings would take the lives of 
numerous other rappers who sold their first productions through 
Cycadelic Records.</p>
<p>But Bobby Wilson survived, saved from prison by the career started at
 Cycadelic Music. He now raises pigeons in Lancaster and publishes a 
magazine about the birds.</p>
<p>“He didn’t have to give me money for those cassettes the way he done 
it,” Wilson said. Kim “opened the door for everybody that was 
struggling.”</p>
<p>Cycadelic has also hung on, partly because of a clientele that 
continues to drive in from around Southern California. Today, Kim’s son,
 Kirk, is using <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CycadelicRecords%3Fref=ts,">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://stores.ebay.com/Compton-Online">EBay</a>
 to sell product worldwide. He stocks a large selection of Chicano 
gangsta rap — with rappers such as Lil G and Ms Krazie — a reflection of
 Compton’s new population.</p>
<p>With free Internet downloads, sales aren’t close to what they were 
during his dad’s heyday, but he sends his product to Hong Kong as easily
 as to Montana. And he still takes in demos from aspiring rappers; only 
now he hopes to promote them in Japan, where rap out of Compton is big 
and Cycadelic Music is a legendary name.</p>
<p>Large indoor swap meets pioneered at Compton Fashion Center remain 
largely Korean owned and have spread across Los Angeles to the Inland 
Empire — some three dozen in all. Others have expanded into the Central 
Valley and Las Vegas. Nowadays, though, new Korean immigrants have a 
vast Korean community, including banks and large companies, which they 
can tap to find their first jobs and business opportunities.</p>
<p>These days, Wan Joon Kim spends only a day a week at his stall. It is
 lined with old photos of him and his wife with then-young Compton 
rappers like DJ Quik and the late Mausberg with their game faces on. 
There’s also one of Shaquille O’Neal, whose 1993 album, “Shaq Diesel,” 
sold poorly at Cycadelic, but Kim remembers him fondly.</p>
<p>Yet after almost half a lifetime of selling one of pop’s most 
incendiary genres, it’s unclear how much Wan Joon Kim ever understood of
 the raps that passed through his store.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“This music I don’t like,” he said, through his 
son. “But I understand where they come from. They’re speaking from their
 hearts and their minds. I understand that.”</p>
