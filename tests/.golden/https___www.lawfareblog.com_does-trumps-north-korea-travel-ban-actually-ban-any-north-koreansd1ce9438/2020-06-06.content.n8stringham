<h1 class="rm-manual">Does Trump's North Korea Travel Ban Actually Ban Any North Koreans?</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> By <a href="file:///contributors/vsauter">Vanessa Sauter</a> </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Tuesday, September 26, 2017, 12:25 PM </p>
<p>The White House’s newest <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/24/enhancing-vetting-capabilities-and-processes-detecting-attempted-entry">proclamation </a>
 amending the administration’s travel ban now includes North Korea. The 
proclamation bans entry of persons from specific countries that would be
 “detrimental to the interests of the United States” under the premise 
of protecting the United States from terrorism and national security 
threats. Citing North Korea’s refusal to cooperate “in any respect” and 
their failure “to satisfy all information-sharing requirements,” the 
United States government will suspend entry for nationals of North Korea
 effective October 18, 2017. The proclamation states explicitly: </p>
<p>(i) North Korea does not cooperate with the United States Government 
in any respect and fails to satisfy all information-sharing 
requirements. </p>
<p>(ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of North Korea as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby suspended.</p>
<p>The proclamation does include a number of exceptions to this expanded ban, notably for dual nationality, diplomacy, and asylum: </p>
<p><span>(b) Exceptions. The suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this proclamation shall not apply to:</span></p>
<p><span>(iv) any dual national of a country designated under section 2 
of this proclamation when the individual is traveling on a passport 
issued by a non-designated country;</span></p>
<p><span>(v) any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or 
diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa 
for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; or</span></p>
<p><span>(vi) any foreign national who has been granted asylum by the 
United States; any refugee who has already been admitted to the United 
States; or any individual who has been granted withholding of removal, 
advance parole, or protection under the Convention Against Torture.</span></p>
<p>There is, however, a catch. Article 3 South Korea’s <a href="http://english.ccourt.go.kr/cckhome/images/eng/main/Constitution_of_the_Republic_of_Korea.pdf">constitution states </a>that: </p>
<p>The territory of the Republic of Korea shall consist of the Korean peninsula and its adjacent islands. </p>
<p>Article 2 of the Nationality Act of the Republic of Korea <a href="http://elaw.klri.re.kr/eng_mobile/viewer.do?hseq=18840&amp;type=part&amp;key=7">extends </a>this: </p>
<p>A person falling under any of the following subparagraphs shall be a national of the Republic of Korea at birth: </p>
<p> (1) A person whose father or mother is a national of the Republic of Korea at the time of the person's birth; </p>
<p> (2) A person whose father was a national of the Republic of Korea at
 the time of the father's death, if the person's father died before the 
person's birth; </p>
<p> (3) A person who was born in the Republic of Korea, if both of the person's parents are unknown or have no nationality. </p>
<p>Together, the ROK Constitution and the Nationality Act offer ROK nationality to all North Koreans. The <a href="http://elaw.klri.re.kr/eng_mobile/viewer.do?hseq=20154&amp;type=part&amp;key=1">North Korean Refugees Protection and Settlement Support Act of 1997</a> says that: </p>
<p>This Act shall apply to residents escaping from North Korea, who have
 expressed their intention to be protected by the Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Any North Korean refugee is eligible for South Korean citizenship and
 protection as long as he or she willfully seeks it and undergoes an ROK
 vetting process to exclude serious criminals and those suspected of 
“disguised escape.”</p>
<p>If any North Korean who desires it is entitled to South Korean 
citizenship--and, crucially, a South Korean passport--this does raise a 
question as to whether the North Korea provisions in the ban are 
effectively a nullity. Who, if anyone, does it bar?</p>
<p>Certainly it prevents those individuals travelling to the United 
States on a North Korean passport. In 2016, the U.S. only issued 100 
non-immigrant and nine immigrant U.S. visas to North Korean citizens. 
The precise nature of those entrants is unclear. It’s possible they were
 largely North Korean diplomats who would refuse to accept or recognize 
South Korean status--and thus would be barred. It should be noted, 
however, that Trump's latest travel ban excludes any foreign nationals 
traveling on a diplomatic visa. By contrast, new North Korean defectors 
in South Korea <a href="http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=14298&amp;cataId=nk00100">numbered </a>more than 1400 last year. Generally speaking, it is <a href="https://www.nknews.org/2014/12/north-koreas-passports-and-how-they-use-them/">nearly impossible</a>
 for an ordinary North Korean to receive a passport and leave the 
country. Those that do, often under visas issued to “visit relatives in 
China,” have the ability to defect through visiting an embassy in China 
and seek South Korean citizenship. This process, coined a “passport 
escape,” offers one of the few ways for North Koreans to defect from the
 regime under the protection of dual nationality and thereby access the 
United States. Regardless, any North Korean who<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/world/2017/09/09/escaping-north-korea-we-had-already-decided-to-kill-ourselves-rather-than-be-sent-back/?utm_term=.0adde9e9ba6b"> successfully escapes</a> using alternative methods can seek the protection of South Korean citizenship, assuming China does not <a href="http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2017/07/china-defends-repatriation-north-koreans/">forcefully repatriate</a> them despite warnings from the U.N.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, Trump’s latest travel ban may not actually bar 
any North Koreans who are capable of entering the United States in the 
first place.</p>
