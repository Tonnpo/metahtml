<p class="rm-manual"><span>By <a href="file:///archives/author/bill-roggio" rel="author">Bill Roggio</a></span> | <span>July 5, 2021</span> | <a href="file:///cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a> | <a href="file:///billroggio">@billroggio</a> </p>
<p>Afghanistan is at risk of complete collapse after the Taliban has 
made dramatic gains in recent days, striking at the heart of the Afghan 
government’s base of power in the north while seizing control of large 
areas of the country – often unopposed by government forces.</p>
<p>The security situation has deteriorated rapidly. In the lax six days 
alone, the Taliban has taken control of 38 of Afghanistan’s 407 
districts – nearly 10 percent of the country – and most all of them in 
critical areas.</p>
<p>In all, the Taliban currently controls 195 districts and contests another 129 districts, according to <a href="file:///mapping-taliban-control-in-afghanistan">the real time assessments by FDD’s Long War Journal</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the Taliban’s offensive, which began in earnest on May 1 – 
upon expiration of the date that the U.S. government originally 
committed to completing its withdrawal under the Doha Agreement – the 
Taliban controlled just 73 districts and contested another 210.</p>
<p>Put simply: The Afghan government controls only a little more than 20 percent of the country at the moment.</p>

<figcaption class=""><a href="file:///mapping-taliban-control-in-afghanistan">Data compiled by FDD’s Long War Journal</a></figcaption><p>Much
 of the Taliban gains have occurred in the north. The importance of the 
Taliban’s northern thrust cannot be understated. The Taliban is taking 
the fight directly to the home of Afghanistan’s elite power brokers and 
government officials. </p>
<p>If the Taliban can deny Afghanistan’s government and its backers 
their base of power, Afghanistan is effectively lost. The government 
could not possibly keep its tenuous footholds in the south, east, west, 
and even in central Afghanistan if the north is lost. If the Afghan 
government loses the north, the Taliban could take the population 
centers in the south, east, and west without a fight, and begin its 
siege of Kabul.</p>
<p>The Taliban has been especially active in Badakhshan province, which 
prior to Al Qaeda’s Sept. 11, 2001 attack on the U.S. served as the 
headquarters to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. Over the past week, 
the Taliban has seized control of 26 of Badakhshan’s 28 districts (the 
Taliban currently controls 26 districts, two were previously 
Taliban-controlled). Only Faizabad, which is also home to the provincial
 capital, and Kuran Wa Munjan are contested, <a href="file:///afghanistan-173310">according to TOLONews.</a> </p>
<p>The Taliban gains in Badakhshan have been stunning. Two of the 
districts previously had no reports of a hint of a Taliban presence. 
Many of the districts fell without a fight while Afghan military 
personnel and government officials have fled to neighboring Tajikistan.</p>
<p>A source in Afghanistan who wishes to remain anonymous due to the 
sensitivity of the work told FDD’s Long War Journal that the Taliban 
seized the Badakhshan district of Shignon after the Afghan military 
abandoned their outposts and they fled to Tajikistan along with the 
district’s governor. </p>
<p>“The same quiet takeover happened in Ishkoshim,” the source said. The
 provincial capital, Faizabad, is “surrounded by Taliban but the 
government is still holding on,” according to the source, however 
residents of the city “are expecting it to fall.” Images and videos of 
surrendered Afghan security personnel litter social media, with the 
Taliban shown in possession of large caches of weapons and ammunitions, 
as well as armored vehicles and even artillery pieces.</p>
<p>The situation in Takhar is equally dire. The Taliban control 14 of 
the 17 districts there. The remaining three, including Taloqun, which 
hosts the provincial capital, are contested. The Taliban has effectively
 surrounded Taloqan City and is launching raids into the city.</p>
<p>The complete loss of Badakhshan and Takhar would a major blow to 
Ahmad Massoud, the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, also known as the “Lion of
 Panjshir” who stood up to the Taliban and was assassinated by Al Qaeda 
just two days prior to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Panjshir was one of 
two provinces fully controlled by the Northern Alliance, and Badakhshan 
was the lifeline to the Massoud and his followers. With Badakhshan under
 Taliban control, the jihadi group will be free to assault Panjshir. </p>
<p>Taliban gains have not been exclusive to the north. In the south, the
 Taliban has taken control of several key districts, such as Gereshk and
 Nawa-i-Barakzai in Helmand, and Shah Wali Khot and Panjwayi in 
Kandahar. Gereshk is the first city to fall to the Taliban, and it is 
home to government loyalists who helped defend Lashkar Gah, the 
provincial capital. </p>
<p>Panjwayi is the birthplace of the Taliban movement, and is both a 
symbolic and tactical victory. With Panjwayi and Shah Wali Kot under 
Taliban control, the vise on Kandahar City will tighten. Additionally, 
in Kandahar, the Taliban are putting pressure on Spin Boldak, with its 
important border crossing to Pakistan. Spin Boldak is the base of power 
of Tadin Razaq, the brother of anti-Taliban commander Abdul Razzaq, who 
was assassinated by the Taliban in Oct. 2018 (General Austin Miller, the
 commander of Resolute Support and U.S. Forces – Afghanistan, was 
present during the attack). Tadin has helped defend Kandahar City, but 
will be forced to defend it or Spin Boldak. </p>
<p>The Taliban’s current phase of its offensive has gone largely 
unchallenged by the Afghan government and security forces. Afghan forces
 has wrestled only a handful of districts from the Taliban, but often 
those districts remain hotly contested or are quickly retaken by the 
Taliban. Afghan officials keep talking about plans to retake key 
districts, but nothing has materialized since the Taliban has pressed 
its attack over two months ago. The government has mobilized and armed 
militia, but their impact is marginal at best at the moment.</p>
<p>If the Afghan government does not get a handle on the security 
situation and finds a way to regain control of the north, its tenure may
 well be measured in weeks or months.</p>
<p>Editor’s note: This article was updated to reflect the change in 
status of districts in Badakhshan. Seven more districts were determined 
to be Taliban controlled in the hours since the report was filed. </p>
