<p> Robert O’Brien, President Donald Trump’s national security advisor, 
confirmed Tuesday morning that the White House is “closely” monitoring 
reports regarding the health of North Korean dictator Kim Jong 
Un.O’Brien, speaking during an interview on Fox News, noted that “North 
Korea is a very closed society, there is not a free press there,” before
 adding U.S. intelligence agencies are still reviewing reports on Kim’s 
health.(Photo) “We’re keeping a close eye on developments in North Korea
 as we are with other parts of the world,” he said.WATCH: </p>

<p class="rm-manual">Well yeah. The Kim family has been the only royalty
 in North Korea since the sixties and have successfully passed down the 
crazy gene, stronger in each generation. The next one is guaranteed to 
be barking mad.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">There isn't a 'free' press here either - they've 
been bought by our enemies and are actively working to destroy this 
Republic while hiding behind constitutional protections that don't apply
 quite as much as their creatures on the courts claim they do. Personal 
destruction is a protected act shielded if done by a 'free' press, for 
example.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> A Democratic Georgia state lawmaker has many 
wondering if he is going to #WalkAway from his party after his abrupt 
decision to step down.Georgia state Rep. Vernon Jones announced 
Wednesday that he has “left the plantation” and would not be completing 
his term, making the surprising statement just more than a week after 
declaring that he was endorsing President Donald Trump.(Video) “I’m sick
 and tired of me and my family being attacked and harassed by the 
Democrat Party for putting my country before my party,” Jones said in a 
statement to CBS 46 in Atlanta.“I take pride in being an independent 
thinker. My first amendment right to freedom of speech </p>

<p class="rm-manual"> Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told Breitbart 
News Tonight that he will continue to battle the progressive attempts to
 force mail-in voting, stressing that vote-by-mail is the “most likely 
place for fraud” and noting that Democrats hope to loosen voting rules 
in the Lone Star State to turn it blue.Paxton discussed the Democrats’ 
increased calls for vote-by-mail, describing the situation in Texas as 
“really simple.”“The law doesn’t allow for mail-in ballots in the cases

Biden once again forgot what he was saying as he attacked President

<p class="rm-manual"> Joe Biden’s presidential campaign spent nearly 
$11,000 on gourmet ice cream that is also a favorite of House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi's.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee’s 
campaign spent $10,600 on Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams between May 2019 
and March 2020. The ice cream was listed as donor gifts, according to 
Federal Election Committee data.Pelosi has taken a lot of heat since 
last week when she joined James Corden on his late-night comedy show and
 showcased her freezer packed with ice cream. Among the selection were 
pints of Jeni’s Splendid."I don't know what I would've done if ice cream
 were not invented," </p>

<p class="rm-manual"> The long goodbye.Like with many people around the 
country, the nationwide lockdown threatened to prevent a Texas woman 
from visiting her dying father before he succumbed to the coronavirus. 
Fortunately, Abby Adair Reinhard was able to bid her elderly dad 
farewell in a touching way: by talking to him on the phone for more than
 30 hours until his death, which she chronicled in a heartbreaking 
Facebook post in early April. “It feels so good to laugh and cry,” wrote
 Reinhard of speaking with her 76-year-old father, Don Adair, for the 
last time. </p>

<p class="rm-manual"> Harvard University said it will not take the $8.6 
million in aid with was granted as part of the U.S. government’s efforts
 to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus lockdown, reversing 
itself and bending to U.S. President Donald Trump who said Tuesday that 
the university should not take the money.“Harvard is going to pay back 
the money and they shouldn’t be taking it,” Trump said Tuesday at a

<p class="rm-manual"> Get behind me, Satan! (Photo) Last Thursday the 
PPP Loan program ran out of money. The $349 billion allotted to the 
program to save small businesses had already been distributed. At least 
20,000 business applications went unprocessed on Thursday and Friday. 
Last Tuesday, eight days ago on April 14th, Speaker Pelosi went on late 
night television and congratulated Senate Democrats for blocking the 
crucial funding to small business owners in America.Pelosi made the 
comments on MSNBC. Nancy Pelosi: “They [Republicans] asked for a quarter
 of a trillion dollars in 48 hours. I said, ‘I don’t think so.’… This 
all happened on the senate side and I congratulated Senate Democrats.” </p>

 visit that New York no longer needed the USNS Comfort to treat COVID-19
 infected patients, offering to deploy it to another hard-hit

<p class="rm-manual"> God bless the media. Without it, I wouldn’t have 
known that CNN’s Don Lemon indignantly demands to know, “Who the hell do
 you think you are?!” Yours truly has only a vague sense of who Don 
Lemon is and has never in my memory seen his program on TV or him in the
 supermarket or anywhere else. But I can answer his question.Mr. Lemon 
reportedly directed his question to armed protesters who, despite the 
nation’s lockdown and stay-at-home orders, had gone public to demand 
their constitutional rights to assemble, to lodge their grievances with 
their government and to arm themselves. That would be the First and 
Second Amendments, respectively. </p>

<p class="rm-manual"> It’s a question worth pondering, and one that 
entered my mind after seeing two recent examples of “journalism” that 
we’ll get to shortly.The preponderance of the legacy media, and many in 
right-wing media as well, insist on the importance of outlets like The 
New York Times, CNN, and NPR. We are constantly told that they play a 
vital role in our society, one whose absence would cause our entire 
system to collapse into tyranny. But is that assumption reality? I’m 
growing more and more skeptical every day.I’ve previously been one to 
shy away from President Trump’s “enemy of the people” language, but 
perhaps I’ve been too kind? </p>

because he just discovered that green energy is a scam. That’s the point
 in his new documentary, “Planet of the Humans,” which was released 
Tuesday for free on YouTube. In a long and poorly written introduction 
on the YouTube page, the people who made the video explain that the
