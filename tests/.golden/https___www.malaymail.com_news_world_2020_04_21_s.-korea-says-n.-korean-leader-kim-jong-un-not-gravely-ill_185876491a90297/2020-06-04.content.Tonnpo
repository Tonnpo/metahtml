<h1 class="rm-manual">S.Korea, China cast doubt over reports N.Korean leader Kim gravely ill</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">Tuesday, 21 Apr 2020 12:17 PM MYT</p>
<figcaption>CNN reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was in 'grave danger'. — Reuters pic</figcaption><p>SEOUL,
 April 21— South Korean and Chinese officials today cast doubt on 
reports North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was ill after media outlets said
 he had undergone a cardiovascular procedure and was in “grave danger”.</p>
<p>Daily NK, a Seoul-based speciality website, reported late yesterday, 
citing one unnamed source in North Korea, that Kim was recovering after 
undergoing the procedure on April 12. The North Korean leader is 
believed to be about 36.</p>
<p>CNN cited a US official with direct knowledge of the matter as saying
 Washington was “monitoring intelligence” that Kim was in grave danger 
after surgery. Bloomberg quoted an unnamed US official as saying the 
White House was told that Kim took a turn for the worse after the 
surgery.</p>
<p>However, two South Korean government officials rejected the CNN 
report without elaborating on whether Kim had undergone surgery. The 
presidential Blue House said there were no unusual signs coming from the
 reclusive, nuclear-capable state.</p>
<p>Kim is the unquestioned leader of North Korea and of its nuclear 
arsenal. He has no clear successor and any instability in the country 
could be a major international risk.</p>
<p>An official at the Chinese Communist Party’s International Liaison 
Department, which deals with North Korea, told Reuters the source did 
not believe Kim was critically ill. China is North Korea’s only major 
ally.</p>
<p>South Korean shares exposed to North Korea tumbled and the Korean won
 fell on the reports. The won traded down more than 1 per cent against 
the dollar even as South Korean government sources said Kim was not 
gravely ill.</p>
<p>US stock futures were trading 0.5 per cent lower, but it was not 
clear how much of that weakness was owing to the collapse in US oil 
prices and consequent concerns over global demand.</p>
<p>Daily NK said Kim had been admitted to hospital on April 12, just 
hours before the cardiovascular procedure, as his health had 
deteriorated since August due to heavy smoking, obesity and overwork.</p>
<p>It said he was now receiving treatment at a villa in the Mount Myohyang resort north of the capital Pyongyang.</p>
<p>“My understanding is that he had been struggling (with cardiovascular
 problems) since last August but it worsened after repeated visits to 
Mount Paektu,” a source was quoted as saying, referring to the country’s
 sacred mountain.</p>
<p>Accompanied by senior North Korean figures, Kim took two 
well-publicised rides on a stallion on the snowy slopes of the mountain 
in October and December.</p>
<p>‘Unlikely to leak’</p>
<p>An authoritative US source familiar with internal US government 
reporting on North Korea questioned the CNN report that Kim was in 
“grave danger”.</p>
<p>“Any credible direct reporting having to do with Kim would be highly 
compartmented intelligence and unlikely to leak to the media,” a Korea 
specialist working for the US government said on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Japan’s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, declined to comment on the reports of Kim’s health.</p>
<p>“We are regularly gathering and analysing information about North 
Korea with great concern,” he said. “We will keep gathering and 
analysing information regarding North Korea by collaborating with other 
countries such as the US”</p>
<p>Kim’s potential health issues could fuel uncertainty over the future 
of the reclusive state’s dynastic rule and stalled denuclearisation 
talks with the United States, issues in which Kim wields absolute 
authority.</p>
<p>Speculation about Kim’s health first arose following his absence from
 the anniversary of the birthday of its founding father and Kim’s 
grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15.</p>
<p>On April 12, North Korean state media reported that Kim Jong-un had 
visited an airbase and observed drills by fighter jets and attack 
aircraft.</p>
<p>Two days later North Korea launched multiple short-range anti-ship 
cruise missiles into the sea and Sukhoi jets fired air-to-surface 
missiles as part of military exercises.</p>
<p>The missile launches were part of the celebrations for Kim’s 
grandfather, Seoul officials said, but there was no North Korea state 
media report on his attendance or the tests.</p>
<p>Reporting from inside North Korea is notoriously difficult, 
especially on matters concerning the country’s leadership, given tight 
controls on information. There have been false and conflicting reports 
in the past on matters related to its leaders.</p>
<p>Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who rules North Korea 
with an iron-fist, taking over the titles of head of state and commander
 in chief of the military since late 2011.</p>
<p>In recent years Kim has launched a diplomatic offensive to promote 
both himself as a world leader and his hermit kingdom, holding three 
meetings with US President Donald Trump, four with South Korean 
President Moon Jae-in and five with China’s President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>He was the first North Korean leader to cross the border into South 
Korea to meet Moon in 2018. Both Koreas are technically still at war, as
 the Korean War of 1950-53 ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.</p>
<p>Kim has sought to have international sanctions against his country 
eased, but has refused to dismantle his nuclear weapons programme, a 
steadfast demand by the United States. — Reuters</p>
