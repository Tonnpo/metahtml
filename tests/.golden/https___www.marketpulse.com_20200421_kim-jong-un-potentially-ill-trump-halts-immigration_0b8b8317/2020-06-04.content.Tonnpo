<h1 class="rm-manual">Kim Jong-un Potentially Ill – Trump Halts Immigration</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> April 21, 2020 <a href="https://www.marketpulse.com/20200421/kim-jong-un-potentially-ill-trump-halts-immigration/print/" rel="nofollow">Print</a> <span><span>0</span></span> </p>
<p>NBC and CNN are currently running stories that North Korean leader 
Kim Jong-un has slipped into a coma following complications from 
cardiovascular surgery and is in “grave danger.” NBC went one step 
further, saying that he may be brain dead in a Tweet. I’ll not argue 
that point and the Tweet itself has since been deleted. It is important 
to note, though that the story is originating from intelligence sources 
monitoring North Korea. That seems to be a rather tenuous source to be 
scooping the media on such an important event potentially.</p>
<p>As if by magic, Yonhap News Agency in South Korea has quoted a South 
Korean Government source, as saying they have seen no unusual signs 
concerning Kim Jong-un’s health. One or more tier-1 news organisations 
are about to get egg on their face, and or face a harsh lesson in the 
perils of reporting by social media, without adequately verifying 
stories. I am just not sure which it will be.</p>
<p>Financial markets are refusing to get whipsawed over the event 
though, taking a “where there is smoke, there is fire” point of view. 
The Korean Won has fallen by 1.0% against the Dollar to 1232.70, a 
slight improvement from the initial post-headline reaction. We can be 
sure that the Bank of Korea will not let volatility get out of hand on 
the Won.</p>
<p>Equities were already on the back foot after a negative session on 
Wall Street overnight. In that context, regional markets have only 
priced in a small-ish reaction to the news relative to their performance
 before it. The Kospi took another leg down after the initial headlines 
and is now 1.80% lower on the day. Other North Asian markets with plenty
 of skin in the South Korea game have also moved lower. Taiwan is down 
2.90%, the Nikkei 225 is down 1.80%, Shanghai is down 1.0%, and the Hang
 Seng is 2.30% lower.</p>
<p>That said, if the North Korean news proves to be correct, the region 
is set for a period of uncertainty. Like all good Communist Peoples 
Democratic Republic’s, Kim Jong-un was its leader for life, and he had 
weeded out a goodly number of potential rivals already. That leaves a 
nuclear-armed North Korea with giant armed forces, facing a potentially 
messy succession process. China will also want to have its input into 
the process, forcefully if necessary.</p>
<p>Nobody should be pricing in a German unification scenario at this 
moment, assuming South Korea could afford it. Instead, if proven right, 
the succession process in North Korea will almost certainly hang like a 
dark cloud over Asian markets until we get a resolution, and hopefully 
not a revolution. Assuming, of course, the news is accurate, which we 
don’t know yet either.</p>
<p>Never to be outdone on Twitter, President Trump has, almost 
simultaneously, announced that he is suspending immigration to the US to
 protect American jobs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is 
more headline baiting than substance in my humble opinion and will have 
zero effect on financial markets. Nobody is immigrating anywhere in the 
world now, let alone the US, the centre of the COVID-19 pandemic. No one
 is likely to be allowed to immigrate anyway for a long time, unless 
it’s on a repatriation flight. Even after peak virus is achieved, 
borders and air-travel are likely to remains strictly limited for 
obvious reasons. North Korea is a more important story today.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, the US and Europe appear to be edging 
towards more fiscal stimulus measures this week. In the US’ case, a 
follow-on $500 billion spending bill that could be enacted this week. 
European leaders will meet remotely to thrash out the details of a 
Trillion Euro recovery fund. As ever with Europe though, things will not
 move either quickly, or in a linear fashion. Nevertheless, the 
potential of both coming to fruition should ensure that equity markets 
hold onto most of their gains for now.</p>
<p>Oil’s roller-coaster ride overnight is well documented. Much has been
 made of the losses sustained by those selling May WTI futures at 
-$37.00 a barrel. I would note though, that for every seller there is a 
buyer. Somewhere in the world yesterday, someone was getting paid by 
sellers to buy oil, and is likely to be cracking the champagne today. 
Harsh lessons were learnt yesterday, about the perils of being stubborn 
on roll costs and holding deliverable futures to maturity, especially 
when you don’t have an underlying commercial interest. That lesson will 
ensure that the same does not happen again with the rolls into the 
June/July contracts.</p>
<p>WTI spot fell 13.50% yesterday to $17.50 a barrel and is unchanged in
 Asia. Brent crude fell %8.0 overnight to $26.00 a barrel. Profit-taking
 in Asia has seen it climb by 50 cents in the morning session. The 
debacle in the WTI futures of the past few days, has highlighted just 
how oversupplied global markets are with oil and the challenges of 
storing it. With an estimated demand short fall of 20 million barrels a 
day; unless the US miraculously reopens tomorrow and everyone jumps in 
their SUV, or OPEC+ brings forward and deepens production cuts, more 
downside pain on spot prices still looms for both contracts</p>
