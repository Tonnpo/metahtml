<p>Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced on Friday that the city of Boston 
will now permit restaurants to sell grocery items during the outbreak to
 help support social distancing measures in supermarkets.</p>
<p>The move lets restaurants that are already permitted by the city to 
sell items by delivery, curbside pickup, and takeout without needing to 
obtain a retail food permit for the sale of uncooked foods.</p>
<p>Walsh says by letting restaurants sell grocery store items, residents
 can help alleviate “social distancing concerns in grocery stores” and 
support restauranteurs.</p>
<p>“This is an unprecedented time for all of us in the City of Boston, 
and our administration is prioritizing how best to keep our residents 
safe and healthy, while also supporting our businesses and some of our 
City’s most vulnerable residents,” Walsh said, in a statement.</p>
<p>Walsh said that restaurants must comply with temporary guidelines 
spelled out by the city’s Inspectional Services Department. They 
include: “making product information available pertaining to safe 
handling instructions" and providing “a statement of identity, an 
ingredient statement, the name and place of business of the food 
manufacturer, packer, or distributor, net quantity of contents, and 
allergen information” as required by the Food Allergen Labeling &amp; 
Consumer Protection Act.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters on Friday, Walsh said that there are now 6,958 
cases of coronavirus in Boston, up 398 from Thursday. That increase in 
cases is the largest the city has seen to date, Walsh said.</p>
