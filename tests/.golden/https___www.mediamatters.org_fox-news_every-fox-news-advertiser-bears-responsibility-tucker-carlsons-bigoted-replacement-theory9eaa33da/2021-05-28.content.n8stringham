<p>Update (4/12/21): Like clockwork, the Murdochs have emerged to express support for Carlson. In a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/12/media/murdoch-response-adl-tucker-carlson/index.html">letter</a>
 responding to the Anti-Defamation League’s Jonathan Greenblatt, who had
 called on Fox to fire the host, Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch dismissed
 the complaint and <a href="https://twitter.com/MattGertz/status/1381707620126494722">falsely claimed</a> that “a full review of the guest interview indicates that Mr. Carlson decried and rejected replacement theory.”</p>
<p> Tucker Carlson is the face of Fox News. He hosts its most-watched 
show, his commentary is regularly injected into programs up and down the
 Fox lineup, and he is the linchpin of the network’s expansion of its 
streaming service, all thanks to the <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/blame-murdochs-tucker-carlson">eager patronage of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, Carlson trafficked in an ugly white nationalist 
conspiracy theory with a bloody history. “I know that the left and all 
the little gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use
 the term ‘replacement,’ if you suggest that the Democratic Party is 
trying to replace the current electorate, the voters now casting 
ballots, with new people, more obedient voters from the Third World,” 
Carlson <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/tucker-carlson-gives-passionate-defense-white-replacement-theory">sneered</a>. “But they become hysterical because that's what's happening actually. Let's just say it: That's true.” </p>
<p>Carlson’s comments <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/tucker-carlson/how-fox-news-pushed-white-supremacist-great-replacement-theory">echo the manifestos</a>
 left behind by the white supremacist perpetrators of mass shootings in 
Christchurch, New Zealand, and El Paso, Texas, as well as the chants of 
marching white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virgina. All were 
motivated by the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which posits 
that a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/05/great-replacement-theory-alt-right-killers-el-paso">globalist cabal</a> is systematically “replacing” white people with people of color through mass immigration.</p>
<p>Every <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/these-are-fox-news-leading-advertisers">Fox News advertiser</a>
 bears responsibility for the beaming of this vile rhetoric to millions 
of people, whether they run their commercials on Carlson’s show or not. </p>
<p>Major advertisers have <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/these-are-tucker-carlsons-leading-advertisers">largely abandoned</a> Carlson’s program because of his tendency to mainstream <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlsons-descent-white-supremacy-timeline">white nationalist talking points</a> like the “great replacement” theory (the show’s <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/wealthy-benefactors-and-beneficiaries-tucker-carlsons-class-war">biggest supporter</a> is a right-wing pillow company). Fox <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/desperate-win-back-viewers-fox-breaks-its-promise-advertisers">encourages</a>
 advertisers to instead place their spots on the network’s other 
programming, suggesting that their brands will be safe from association 
with its prime-time demagogues.</p>
<p>Fox has repeatedly violated that deal. Carlson’s latest rant came not
 on his own program, but on Fox News Primetime, the network’s 7 p.m. 
right-wing opinion show. Alongside Carlson’s interview, Fox aired 
advertisements for blue-chip companies like Amazon, Chevron, Energizer, 
Farmers Insurance, Ford, General Motors, GlaxoSmithKline, Liberty 
Mutual, Novartis, and USAA.</p>
<p>These companies have likely blacklisted Carlson’s own show from their
 advertisements. But because Carlson is so thoroughly incorporated into 
Fox’s programming, that does not suffice.</p>
<p>Fox recently launched Tucker Carlson Today, a thrice-weekly show on 
its Fox Nation streaming service featuring the host. Unbound by the 
presence of advertisers, Carlson has used that platform to <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-nation/tucker-carlson-calls-trans-people-challenge-perpetuation-species">call trans people</a> “a challenge to the perpetuation of the species” and promote <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/coronavirus-covid-19/tucker-carlson-guest-claims-its-dangerous-vaccinate-everyone">warnings</a> about the purported danger posed by the coronavirus vaccines.</p>
<p>To bolster that program and increase Fox Nation signups, Carlson has 
been on a tour of other Fox programs from both the putative “news side” 
and “opinion side” over the past 10 days, appearing on Fox &amp; 
Friends, The Ingraham Angle, Outnumbered, Gutfeld!, and America’s 
Newsroom before last night’s Fox News Primetime interview. </p>
<p>His expanded role at the network means that every Fox advertiser is 
propping him up. Their dollars are supporting what Carlson’s <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-insiders-fox-promoting-white-supremacy-and-hurting-black-americans">own colleagues admit</a> is “a white supremacist cell inside the top cable network in America.”</p>
