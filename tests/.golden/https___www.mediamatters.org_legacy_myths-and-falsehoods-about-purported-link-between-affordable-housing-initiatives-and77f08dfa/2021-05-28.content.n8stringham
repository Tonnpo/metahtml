<p>Conservative and other media figures -- echoing a reported strategy 
on the part of Republicans -- have attempted to lay blame for the 
financial crisis on proponents of the expansion of affordable housing. 
Those attacks are premised on several myths and falsehoods.</p>
<p>Conservative and other media figures, echoing a reported strategy on 
the part of Republicans, have attempted to deflect blame for the 
financial crisis onto proponents of the expansion of affordable housing 
and legislation and institutions created to effect that expansion.</p>
<p>Newsweek senior editor Daniel Gross wrote in an October 7 Slate <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2201641">commentary</a>:</p>
<p>On the Republican side of Congress, in the right-wing financial media
 (which is to say the financial media), and in certain parts of the 
op-ed-o-sphere, there's a consensus emerging that the whole mess should 
be laid at the feet of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the failed mortgage 
giants, and the Community Reinvestment Act, a law passed during the 
Carter administration. The CRA, which was amended in the 1990s and this 
decade, requires banks -- which had a long, distinguished history of not
 making loans to minorities -- to make more efforts to do so.</p>
<p>Recent attacks have turned personal, with conservative media -- along
 with congressional Republicans and Sen. John McCain -- targeting Rep. 
Barney Frank (D-MA) directly as a purported culprit in the financial 
crisis, falsely representing his decades-long advocacy of increased 
affordable housing as advocacy of lax oversight over Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p>The attacks are premised on several myths and falsehoods and, in the 
case of CRA and attacks on minority lending, have taken on a racial 
tinge.</p>
<p> MYTH: The 1977 Community Reinvestment Act forced lenders into irresponsible lending</p>
<p>In a September 28 Boston Globe column, Jeff Jacoby <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2008/09/28/franks_fingerprints_are_all_over_the_financial_fiasco/">asserted</a>:</p>
<p>The roots of this crisis go back to the Carter administration. That 
was when government officials, egged on by left-wing activists, began 
accusing mortgage lenders of racism and “redlining” because urban blacks
 were being denied mortgages at a higher rate than suburban whites.</p>
<p>The pressure to make more loans to minorities (read: to borrowers 
with weak credit histories) became relentless. Congress passed the 
Community Reinvestment Act, empowering regulators to punish banks that 
failed to 'meet the credit needs' of 'low-income, minority, and 
distressed neighborhoods.' Lenders responded by loosening their 
underwriting standards and making increasingly shoddy loans."</p>
<p>Jacoby is not alone in his reference to “minority” lending. On the 
September 18 edition of Fox News' Your World, host Neil Cavuto <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2008/09/19/cavuto-suggests-congress-should-have-warned-tha/145132">asked</a>
 Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-CA), "[W]hen you and many of your colleagues 
were pushing for more minority lending and more expanded lending to 
folks who heretofore couldn't get mortgages, when you were pushing 
homeownership ... Are you totally without culpability here?" Cavuto 
later said, “I'm just saying, I don't remember a clarion call that said,
 'Fannie and Freddie are a disaster. Loaning to minorities and risky 
folks is a disaster.' ”</p>
<p>But the suggestion that the financial crisis was caused by banks lending irresponsibly to comply with the <a href="http://www.ffiec.gov/cra/history.htm">CRA</a> is widely <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2008/09/30/media-conservatives-baselessly-blame-community/145327">discredited</a>. According to housing <a href="http://74.125.45.104/search?q=cache:TcA9Tzx4aqgJ:www.house.gov/apps/list/hearing/financialsvcs_dem/barr021308.pdf+subprime+University+of+Michigan%27s+Michael+Barr&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk%252">experts</a>,
 a large number of subprime loans were not made under the CRA, which 
applies only to depository institutions. A study released earlier this 
year by a law firm specializing in CRA compliance <a href="http://www.traigerlaw.com/publications/addendum_to_traiger_hinckley_llp_cra_foreclosure_study_1-14-08.pdf#page=2">estimated</a>
 that in the 15 most populous metropolitan areas, 84.3 percent of 
subprime loans in 2006 were made by financial institutions not governed 
by the CRA. Moreover, Janet Yellen, president and CEO of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, stated in a March 2008 <a href="http://www.frbsf.org/news/speeches/2008/0331.html">speech</a>
 that “studies have shown that the CRA has increased the volume of 
responsible lending to low- and moderate-income households” [emphasis 
added].</p>
<p>In testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, University of Michigan law professor Michael Barr <a href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/hearing/financialsvcs_dem/barr021308.pdf">stated</a>:</p>
<p>Despite the fact that CRA appears to have increased bank and thrift 
lending in low- and moderate-income communities, such institutions are 
not the only ones operating in these areas. In fact, with new and 
lower-cost sources of funding available from the secondary market 
through securitization, and with advances in financial technology, 
subprime lending exploded in the late 1990s, reaching over $600 billion 
and 20% of all originations by 2005. More than half of subprime loans 
were made by independent mortgage companies not subject to comprehensive
 federal supervision; another 30 percent of such originations were made 
by affiliates of banks or thrifts, which are not subject to routine 
examination or supervision, and the remaining 20 percent were made by 
banks and thrifts. Although reasonable people can disagree about how to 
interpret the evidence, my own judgment is that the worst and most 
widespread abuses occurred in the institutions with the least federal 
oversight.</p>
<p>The housing crisis we face today, driven by serious problems in the 
subprime lending, suggests that our system of home mortgage regulation, 
including CRA, is seriously deficient. We need to fill what my friend, 
the late Federal Reserve Board Governor Ned Gramlich aptly termed, “the 
giant hole in the supervisory safety net.” Banks and thrifts are subject
 to comprehensive federal regulation and supervision; their affiliates 
far less so; and independent mortgage companies, not at all. Moreover, 
many market-based systems designed to ensure sound practices in this 
sector-broker reputational risk, lender oversight of brokers, investor 
oversight of lenders, rating agency oversight of securitizations, and so
 on -- simply did not work. Conflicts of interest, lax regulation, and 
“boom times” covered up the extent of the abuses -- at least for a 
while, at least for those not directly affected by abusive practices. 
But no more.</p>

 during the September 25 edition of The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly,
 radio host Laura Ingraham during the September 25 edition of Fox News' 
The O'Reilly Factor, and a September 25 Investor's Business Daily <a href="http://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&amp;status=article&amp;id=307234949613274">editorial</a> claiming that the CRA “forced banks to make many more subprime loans.”</p>
<p> MYTH: Excessive lending to undocumented immigrants is responsible for the financial crisis</p>
<p>On the October 9 edition of CNN's Lou Dobbs Tonight, San Diego radio host Roger Hedgecock <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2008/10/10/on-dobbs-radio-host-claimed-hud-said-about-5-mi/145592">claimed</a>
 that "[w]e have a situation where today HUD [the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development] was talking about 5 million illegal alien home 
mortgage loans that have gone bad." Radio host Joe Madison responded, 
“You see, this really angers me, because I'm sitting here ... and 
wondering, how is it that people who are illegal get loans when people 
in my community who are legal have a difficulty getting loans, and if 
they do get them, they're often from predators?” Neither Hedgecock nor 
Madison cited a source for the purported HUD statistic. On October 9, 
the Drudge Report linked to an <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/static/images/item/20081010-hudsnap.jpg">article</a> on the Phoenix radio station KFYI website under the <a href="http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2008/10/09/20081009_170743.htm">headline</a>, “HUD: Five Million Fraudulent Mortgages Held by Illegals...” However, according to an October 9 Phoenix Business Journal <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/10/06/daily54.html?ana=from_rss">article</a>
 posted at 3:15 pm MT (more than an hour before Lou Dobbs Tonight 
aired), HUD “says there is no basis to news reports that more than 5 
million bad mortgages are held by illegal immigrants” and “a HUD 
spokesman said ... his agency has no data showing the number of illegal 
immigrants holding foreclosed or bad mortgages.”</p>
<p>Other media figures advancing the claim that lending to undocumented 
immigrants is responsible for the mortgage crisis include syndicated 
columnist Michelle Malkin, who <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2008/09/24/illegal-immigration-and-the-mortgage-mess/">wrote</a>
 in her September 24 column that “there's one giant paternal elephant in
 the room that has slipped notice: How illegal immigration, 
crime-enabling banks, and open-borders Bush policies fueled the mortgage
 crisis.</p>
<p>MYTH: Congressional Democrats, led by Barney Frank, opposed strengthening oversight over Fannie and Freddie</p>
<p>In a September 18 <a href="http://www.billoreilly.com/newslettercolumn?pid=24288">column</a>, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly falsely <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2008/09/21/oreilly-falsely-claimed-that-rep-frank-sat-by-w/145145">claimed</a>
 that Frank “sat by as mortgage brokers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made 
bad loans” and asserted that "[i]nstead of demanding responsible 
business practices from Fannie and Freddie, Frank continued to pound the
 table to extend even more credit to 'low income' families." In fact, 
Frank did not “s[i]t by.” Frank's efforts to enhance regulatory 
oversight on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac include:</p>
<ul>
<li> In 2005, Frank, then the ranking Democrat on the House Financial 
Services Committee, worked with committee chairman Rep. Michael Oxley 
(R-OH) on the Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2005, which would 
have <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_reports&amp;docid=f:hr171p1.109.pdf">established</a>
 the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to replace the Office of 
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) as overseer of the 
activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. After <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;dbname=cp109&amp;sid=cp109PfdOE&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr171p1.109&amp;item=&amp;sel=TOC_414931&amp;">voting</a> for the bill in committee, Frank <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll547.xml">voted</a> against final passage of the bill on the House floor, <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2005_record&amp;page=H9176&amp;position=all">stating</a> that he was doing so because an <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2005_record&amp;page=H9172&amp;position=all">amendment</a> to the bill <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll541.xml">on the House floor</a> imposed restrictions on the kinds of nonprofit organizations that could receive funding under the bill.</li> </ul>
<ul>
<li> In early 2007, as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Frank <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2008/09/21/oreilly-falsely-claimed-that-rep-frank-sat-by-w/145145">sponsored</a> <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.01427:">H.R. 1427</a>,
 a bill to create the FHFA, granting that agency “general supervisory 
and regulatory authority over” Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and directing
 it to reform the companies' business practices and regulate their 
exposure to credit and market risk. Among other things, Frank's 
legislation, titled the "<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h1427eh.txt.pdf">Federal Housing Finance Reform Act</a> of 2007," <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h1427eh.txt.pdf#page=14">directed</a>
 the FHFA director to “ensure” that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
“operate[] in a safe and sound manner, including maintenance of adequate
 capital and internal controls” and to <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h1427eh.txt.pdf#page=17">establish</a>
 standards for “management of credit and counterparty risk” and 
“management of market risk.” The FHFA was eventually created after 
Congress incorporated <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h3221enr.txt.pdf">provisions</a> that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2008_record&amp;page=H7003&amp;position=all">said</a> were "<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2008_record&amp;page=H7004&amp;position=all">similar</a>" to those of H.R. 1427 into the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which the president signed into law on <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR03221:@@@R">July 30</a>.</li> </ul>
<p>Some in the conservative media have taken the charge further, 
suggesting that in the 1990s, Frank allowed his relationship with Fannie
 Mae executive Herb Moses to affect his responsibility as a senior 
member of the House Financial Services Committee to conduct oversight 
over Fannie Mae. For <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2008/10/08/fox-news-sammon-ignores-contrary-evidence-in-su/145538">example</a>,
 in an October 3 article, Fox News deputy Washington Managing editor 
Bill Sammon asserted, in a charge he later echoed on Fox News' The 
O'Reilly Factor, “Unqualified home buyers were not the only ones who 
benefitted from Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank's efforts to deregulate 
Fannie Mae throughout the 1990s. So did Frank's partner, a Fannie Mae 
executive at the forefront of the agency's push to relax lending 
restrictions.”</p>
<p>In his article, however, Sammon cited only two sources: an anonymous 
Republican congressional staffer and Dan Gainor, who, Sammon did not 
note, is an employee of the conservative Media Research Center. 
Moreover, Sammon misrepresented Frank's record by reporting in his 
article that Frank “spent years blocking GOP lawmakers from imposing 
tougher regulations” on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Sammon did not note 
in his article or during an October 6 appearance on The O'Reilly Factor 
that in the early 1990s, while Frank's Democratic Party still held the 
majority in Congress, and while Moses was at Fannie Mae, Frank supported
 bills to increase regulation of Fannie Mae and create a government 
regulatory agency that would supervise and have authority over some 
aspects of the company:</p>
<ul>
<li> On September 30, 1991, Frank <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1991/roll278.xml">voted for</a> a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:h.r.02900:">bill</a>
 to create a new regulatory agency to oversee Fannie and Freddie that 
would have "[r]equire[d] the [agency's] Director to establish by 
regulation a risk-based capital test for the enterprises," "[r]equire[d]
 the Director to establish risk-based capital levels for each enterprise
 according to statutory guidelines," "[e]stablishe[d] minimum capital 
levels, critical capital levels, and enforcement levels," and "[s]et[] 
forth mandatory supervisory actions for the enterprises at various 
capital levels, including mandatory conservatorship."</li> </ul>
<ul>
<li> In October 1992, Frank <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1992/roll476.xml">voted for</a> the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:h.r.05334:">Housing and Community Development Act of 1992</a>,
 creating OFHEO, which was tasked with “ensur[ing] that Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac (the enterprises) and their affiliates are adequately 
capitalized and operating safely.” As with the bill Frank voted for in 
September 1991, the new law gave OFHEO authority to set, monitor, and 
enforce risk-based capital requirements for Fannie and Freddie.</li> </ul>
<p>Neal Boortz also advanced this claim about Frank and his former partner <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2008/10/10/back-to-back-guests-on-boyles-repeated-discredi/145594">during</a> the October 8 edition of his nationally syndicated radio show. On October 8, The Wall Street Journal <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122342367451513361.html">reported</a>
 that "[a] conservative political organization will begin airing 
nationwide TV advertisements Wednesday that criticize congressional 
Democrats for their ties to mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae."</p>
<p> MYTH: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac caused the “current financial mess”</p>
<p>In a September 19 Huffington Post blog post, Center for American Progress senior fellow David Abramowitz <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-m-abromowitz/when-in-doubt-yell-fannie_b_127688.html">wrote</a>:</p>
<p>“There must be a Republican playbook circulating widely with a 
chapter entitled, 'What to say if asked who's to blame for the 
foreclosure mess.' Because an awful lot of Republican candidates are all
 suddenly yelling 'Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae' whenever plunging
 home prices and the housing crisis comes up. [...] So their plan seems 
to be to chant Fannie Mae often and loudly enough, and hope the public 
will get confused about who really caused this huge national calamity. 
It is always a good political story to just blame a bad guy who has 
something to do with the same topic.</p>
<p>Indeed, during the September 24 edition of Fox News' Special Report, host Brit Hume <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/%E2%80%9D/research/2008/10/01/special-report-falsely-suggested-fannie-and-fre/145362%22">said</a>,
 “Many financial analysts are saying that if mortgage giants Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac had been effectively regulated years ago, the 
supercharged subprime mortgage meltdown that led to the current 
financial mess would either never have happened or would have been 
nowhere near as severe.” But <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2008/10/01/special-report-falsely-suggested-fannie-and-fre/145362">rebutting</a>
 the suggestion that the subprime mortgage purchasing activities of 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac caused the “current financial mess,” 
economist Dean Baker recently <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=market_place_misleads_the_publ">stated</a>:</p>
<p>Fannie and Freddie got into subprime junk and helped fuel the housing
 bubble, but they were trailing the irrational exuberance of the private
 sector. They lost market share in the years 2002-2007, as the volume of
 private issue mortgage backed securities exploded. In short, while 
Fannie and Freddie were completely irresponsible in their lending 
practices, the claim that they were responsible for the financial 
disaster is absurd on its face -- kind of like the claim that the earth 
is flat.</p>
<p>Indeed, in a 2006 Securities and Exchange Commission filing (available <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=108360&amp;p=irol-secAnnual&amp;control_SelectGroup=Annual%20Filings">here</a>)
 covering its activities in 2004, Fannie Mae stated: “We did not 
participate in large amounts of these non-traditional mortgages in 2004 
and 2005.” In the report, Fannie Mae also noted the growth of subprime 
lending and reported, “These trends and our decision not to participate 
in large amounts of these non-traditional mortgages contributed to a 
significant loss in our share of new single-family mortgage-related 
securities issuances to private-label issuers during this period.”</p>
<p>Gross wrote in Slate that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were an 
“integral part” of a “culture of stupid, reckless lending.” But, he 
wrote, they are not the primary culprits in the current financial 
crisis. He wrote:</p>
<p>Investment banks created a demand for subprime loans because they saw
 it as a new asset class that they could dominate. They made subprime 
loans for the same reason they made other loans: They could get paid for
 making the loans, for turning them into securities, and for trading 
them-frequently using borrowed capital.</p>
<p>As an example, he noted that the following happened during testimony 
by Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld before the House Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform:</p>
<p>At Monday's hearing, Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., gamely tried to pin 
Lehman's demise on Fannie and Freddie. After comparing Lehman's small 
political contributions with Fannie and Freddie's much larger ones, Mica
 asked Fuld what role Fannie and Freddie's failure played in Lehman's 
demise. Fuld's <a href="http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/barbs-traded--at-hearing-on-lehmans-fall-2008-10-06_2.html">response</a>: “De minimis.”</p>
<p>From Fuld's testimony:</p>
<p>MICA: And one of your big com -- well, one of the big packagers, or 
the competitor, so to speak, was Fannie Mae, which was deep into this. 
And you were -- you were dealing in some of the paper, I think, for 
secondary markets and other securitized mortgage paper, to basically 
package it and make money off it. Is that right?</p>
<p>FULD: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>MICA: What was Lehman Brothers' exposure to the debt of Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac, and what role did their collapse play in precipitating 
some of your financial troubles?</p>
<p>FULD: Our --</p>
<p>MICA: It didn't matter or you --</p>
<p>FULD: Our exposure to both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was de minimis, sir.</p>
<p>MYTH: Sen. Barack Obama's campaign has significantly more ties to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than does John McCain's</p>
<p>In articles about the presidential candidates' responses to the economic crisis, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uslatest/story/0,,-7809719,00.html">Associated Press</a>, the <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=796668">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>, the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/19/MNUB130FRV.DTL">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/18/AR2008091803822.html">The Washington Post</a>
 reported that the McCain campaign criticized Sen. Barack Obama for, in 
the words of McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds, “his ties to spiraling 
lenders like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and their jet-set CEOs.” But those 
articles did not note that several senior McCain campaign aides have 
served as lobbyists for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or both. According to a
 Media Matters for America <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2008/09/19/print-media-reported-mccain-attacks-on-obama-fo/145122">search</a> of the Senate Office of Public Records' <a href="http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=choosefields">Lobbying Disclosure Act Database</a>, they include:</p>

<p> MYTH: Democrats sought to divert funding in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act to ACORN</p>
<p>On the September 29 <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0809/29/ldt.01.html">edition</a>
 of CNN's Lou Dobbs Tonight, host Lou Dobbs claimed: “ACORN [Association
 of Community Organizations for Reform Now] stands to reap hundreds of 
millions of dollars from a government bailout of Wall Street.” Dobbs 
added later: “This is a straightforward deal for ACORN and other groups,
 left-wing groups, set up by the Democratic leadership of Congress. 
They're not interested in the bailout per se. They want to spread this 
out, and many people believe that this bailout in part is dear to the 
Democratic leadership because they want to advance a social agenda here 
as much as much as an economic bailout of Wall Street.” Numerous other 
media figures also <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2008/10/10/wsjs-fund-falsely-claimed-that-acorn-almost-got/145580">reported</a> the <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2008/10/01/media-figures-falsely-accuse-democrats-of-attem/145369">false claim</a> that Democrats were trying to steer money to ACORN. In fact, neither the <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/LegislativeTextofChairmansDoddsproposalfortheTreasuryBailoutplanAYO08B68_xml.pdf">draft proposal</a> nor the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/special/econstimbill/pdf/AMEND001.pdf">final version</a> of the bill contained any language mentioning ACORN. Those making the false claim were misrepresenting a provision -- <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0908/ACORN_outrage_removes_affordable_housing_provision.html">since removed</a>
 -- that would have directed 20 percent of any profits realized on 
troubled assets purchased under the plan into two previously established
 funds: the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund, which, under
 <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ289.110">the law</a> authorizing them, distribute funds through state block grants and through competitive application processes, respectively.</p>
<p>On the October 9 edition of Fox News' Hannity &amp; Colmes, Wall Street Journal columnist John Fund <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2008/10/10/wsjs-fund-falsely-claimed-that-acorn-almost-got/145580">similarly made</a> the false claim that ACORN “almost got a slush fund in the housing bailout bill a few weeks ago.”</p>
<p>MYTH: Former President Clinton has blamed Democrats for the financial crisis</p>
<p>In a September 30 post on Time.com's Swampland <a href="http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/09/bill_clinton_stars_in_mccain_a.html">blog</a>, Washington bureau chief Jay Carney <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2008/10/01/times-carney-falsely-suggested-clinton-pinned-t/145366">claimed</a>
 that comments former President Bill Clinton made during a September 25 
interview on ABC's Good Morning America that were subsequently featured 
in a McCain campaign ad “could undercut Democratic arguments that Bush 
and the Republicans are primarily responsible” for the financial crisis.
 During that interview, Clinton said, “I think the responsibility that 
the Democrats have may rest more in resisting any efforts by Republicans
 in the Congress or by me when I was president to put some standards and
 tighten up a little on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.” But in reporting on
 the ad, Carney failed to point out that in the very same interview, 
Clinton also said, “I think the biggest mistake, by the way, that 
contributed to the current circumstance that almost nobody talks about, 
is the repeal after decades of something called the uptick rule, which 
allowed the hedge funds, heavily leveraged, and others to just drive 
down the market without any kind of automatic stoppers.” In a separate 
interview aired that day with Matt Lauer, co-host of NBC's Today, 
Clinton stated of the financial situation: "[T]his thing really took off
 when the SEC, under this administration, exercised less oversight and 
they got rid of something called the uptick rule, which enabled betting 
down on housing stocks to go crazy."</p>
<p>The uptick rule, which was created in 1938, was a securities trading rule that regulated market <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/shortselling/shortselling1.asp">short selling</a>,
 the act of selling a stock that an investor does not own (but borrows 
from a broker or someone else) in anticipation that the stock's price 
will decrease. After a June 13, 2007, decision that became effective 
July 3, 2007, the SEC issued a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2007/34-55970.pdf">final rule</a> that repealed the uptick rule.</p>
<p>From C-SPAN's October 6 coverage of the House Oversight Reform Committee:</p>
<p>MICA: Again, you -- when you opened your statement, you said that 
Lehman Brothers -- and it was around for what, 150 years -- dealt in 
some pretty hard assets and some secure investments. You've been around a
 while. What turned the corner for you to get into some of the more 
speculative ventures, like subprime and some of the other, again, 
riskier investments?</p>
<p>FULD: As I said in my verbal testimony, our participation in the 
mortgage-related businesses was clearly a natural for us, given our 
dominance in fixed income. That was something that went back a number of
 years.</p>
<p>And even as I listened, as I say, to the panel before me, they 
correctly pointed out that this was a goal of the government to provide 
funding and mortgages to a number of people that typically would not or 
could not have received a mortgage.</p>
<p>MICA: And one of your big com -- well, one of the big packagers, or 
the competitor, so to speak, was Fannie Mae, which was deep into this. 
And you were -- you were dealing in some of the paper, I think, for 
secondary markets and other securitized mortgage paper, to basically 
package it and make money off it. Is that right?</p>
<p>FULD: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>MICA: What was Lehman Brothers' exposure to the debt of Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac, and what role did their collapse play in precipitating 
some of your financial troubles?</p>
<p>FULD: Our --</p>
<p>MICA: It didn't matter or you --</p>
<p>FULD: Our exposure to both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was de minimis, sir.</p>
<p>MICA: OK, but their collapse -- did that help precipitate any problems with your firm?</p>
<p>FULD: It certainly set the stage for an environment, as I talked 
about loss of confidence and credit-crisis mentality that permeated our 
market, clearly set the stage for investors losing confidence, 
counterparties asking for additional collateral, and clearly an 
environment that lost liquidity --</p>
<p>MICA: I notice you --</p>
<p>FULD : -- which is the lifeblood of the capital market system.</p>
