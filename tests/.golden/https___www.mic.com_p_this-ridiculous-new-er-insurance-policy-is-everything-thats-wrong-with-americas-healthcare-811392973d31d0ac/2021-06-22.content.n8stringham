<p>No one should have to go without potentially lifesaving emergency 
care out of fear that they might not be able to afford it. But 
physicians say that health insurance behemoth UnitedHealthcare will 
create exactly this scenario through <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2021/06/emergency-physicians-oppose-new-unitedhealth-policy-enabling-retroactive-ed-claims-denial/?rf=1" rel="noreferrer">a new policy that would allow it to retroactively deny emergency department claims</a>,
 MedCity News reported. Expecting people with zero medical training to 
somehow diagnose themselves is messed-up, period â€” but especially now,
 when worrisome symptoms like a fever or nausea could very well indicate
 COVID-19.</p>
<p>Starting July 1, UnitedHealthcare can deny or limit coverage for an 
emergency department (ED) visit if the insurance company determines it 
wasnâ€™t, in fact, an emergency, according to MedCity News. The outlet 
explained that UnitedHealthcare will make this call based on the 
patientâ€™s condition, the type and number of diagnostic services they 
receive, and other external factors.</p>
<p>The insurer implemented the policy â€” which would apply to fully 
insured members in most states â€” as a means of reducing ED costs, 
Tracey Lempner, UnitedHealthcareâ€™s director of communications, told 
MedCity News. â€œUnnecessary use of the emergency room costs nearly $32 
billion annually, driving up healthcare costs for everyone,â€ she wrote
 in an email to the outlet. â€œWe are taking steps to make care more 
affordable, encouraging people who do not have a healthcare emergency to
 seek treatment in a more appropriate setting, such as an urgent care 
center.â€ Per MedCity News, providers can submit an attestation if they
 consider the visit an emergency, in which case UnitedHealthcare would 
probably still cover it.</p>
<p>But in a letter to UnitedHealthcare, Richard J. Pollack, president 
and CEO of the American Hospital Association wrote that â€œthreatening 
patients with a financial penalty for making the wrong decision could 
have a chilling effect on seeking emergency careâ€ and highlighted <a href="https://www.aha.org/lettercomment/2021-06-08-letter-unitedhealthcare-retroactive-denial-coverage-emergency-level-care" rel="noreferrer">the danger of delaying emergency care during the pandemic</a>.</p>
<p>Pollackâ€™s letter also described UnitedHealthcareâ€™s confusing, contradictory advice to its members: On the one hand, <a href="https://www.uhc.com/member-resources/know-your-care-options/urgent-care" rel="noreferrer">the insurance companyâ€™s website urges them to beeline it to the ER</a>
 or call 911 if they think theyâ€™re experiencing on emergency. It then 
lists symptoms that the payer says would warrant urgent care (rather 
than emergency room care), like stomach pain, diarrhea, and abnormal 
vaginal bleeding â€” but Pollack noted that these same symptoms could 
also indicate a medical emergency.</p>
<p>The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) shares Pollackâ€™s <a href="https://twitter.com/EmergencyDocs/status/1402350787083264002" rel="noreferrer">concern that UnitedHealthcareâ€™s policy could dissuade people from seeking emergency care</a>.
 â€œIn many instances, even physicians cannot know if a patientâ€™s 
symptoms require emergency treatment without conducting a comprehensive 
medical examination,â€ ACEP wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. 
"Reckless policies like this will leave millions fearful of seeking 
medical care just as we're getting hold of the pandemic," the 
organization tweeted alongside the statement. </p>
<p>Indeed, in response to UnitedHealthcareâ€™s new policy, Dr. Megan 
Ranney, M.D., M.P.H., a physician at Brown Emergency Medicine, tweeted 
examples of seemingly innocuous symptoms that turned out to be 
emergencies upon further evaluation. â€œIâ€™ve taken care of people with
 â€˜indigestionâ€™ who had heart attacks,â€ she wrote. â€œPeople with 
â€˜pink eyeâ€™ who had vision-threatening infections. Ppl with a 
'tension headache' who had brain bleed.â€ Itâ€™s scary to imagine what 
wouldâ€™ve happened if these patients hadnâ€™t gone to the ER because 
they weren't sure if their symptoms amounted to an emergency â€” at 
least in the eyes of an insurance company.</p>
<p>ACEP also tweeted that <a href="https://twitter.com/EmergencyDocs/status/1402407121694625796" rel="noreferrer">they believe UnitedHealthcareâ€™s policy is unlawful</a> because it violates the <a href="https://www.emergencyphysicians.org/article/access/prudent-layperson-standard" rel="noreferrer">Prudent Layperson Standard</a>,
 which requires insurance companies to cover emergency care based on a 
patientâ€™s symptoms, not their diagnosis. Lempner, however, told 
MedCity News that if a patient ends up getting treatment for a 
non-emergent issue (like pink eye) during an ED visit, the company will 
cover it based on the patient's benefit plan. </p>
<p>As MedCity News notes, this differs from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/05/23/613649094/anthem-policy-discouraging-avoidable-emergency-room-visits-faces-criticism#:~:text=McNew%2FGetty%20Images-,The%20health%20insurance%20company%20Anthem%20has%20introduced%20a%20policy%20discouraging,%22avoidable%22%20emergency%20room%20visits.&amp;text=Under%20the%20health%20insurance%20company's,actually%20have%20an%20emergency%20condition" rel="noreferrer">Anthemâ€™s similar, highly-criticized policy</a>,
 which took effect in 2017. Under that policy, if an ED diagnosis falls 
under a list of non-emergent conditions, Anthem will evaluate the visit 
and may choose not to cover it. <a href="https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/finance/doctors-sue-anthem-over-dangerous-er-coverage-policy" rel="noreferrer">ACEP and the Medical Association of Georgia sued Anthemâ€™s Blue Cross Shield of Georgia</a> over the policy in 2018 and are currently in the midst of that battle.</p>
<p>The somewhat bright side, according to MedCity News: When challenged,
 Anthem overturned most of the 12,000 ED claims it denied â€” perhaps 
suggesting that UnitedHealthcareâ€™s policy might not be as rigid, 
either. But none of this changes the fact that it forces patients into 
the cruel position of making a risky decision about their health â€” and
 during a pandemic, no less. </p>
