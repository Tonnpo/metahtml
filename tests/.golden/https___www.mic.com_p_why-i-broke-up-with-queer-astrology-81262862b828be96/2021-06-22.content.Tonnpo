<h1 class="rm-manual">Why I broke up with queer astrology</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>By </span><span>Ty Baniewicz</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual">June 21, 2021</p>
<p>The first date I went on after moving to San Francisco in my 20s was 
with a woman Iâ€™d met my first night in town. She sat with me in the 
corner of a gay bar and swiftly guessed I was a Virgo. I didnâ€™t know 
much about myself or how to be a successful gay in the Big City, but in 
that moment I knew, at least, what I needed to learn: astrology.</p>
<p>Since then, Iâ€™ve educated myself exhaustively on the signs. Iâ€™ve 
paid for readings and synastry workshops. And although Iâ€™ve tended to 
affect some mild self-deprecation about it at parties when it inevitably
 comes up, in truth, Iâ€™ve found astrology fascinating and meaningful.</p>
<p>A few months ago, however, a marketing email for a popular new 
astrology app with a broad queer following slipped into my inbox. It 
promised, among other things, that I would â€œalways know why I was 
feeling what I was feelingâ€ if I paid to use it. And for the first 
time in a decade, I thought perhaps that it was time to take a break.</p>

<p>Millennialsâ€™ demand for astrological content has been on the uptick for the past several years and the internetâ€™s <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/desperately-seeking-certainty" rel="noreferrer">full</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/opinion/kara-swisher-chani-nicholas.html" rel="noreferrer">of</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/opinion/astrology-occult-millennials.html" rel="noreferrer">theories</a> about why. Whatever the reason, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/astrology-industry-boomed-during-pandemic-online-entrepreneurs-2020-12" rel="noreferrer">capitalism has not slept on it</a>. Co-Star, a popular astrology app, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/style/astrology-apps-venture-capital.html" rel="noreferrer">backed by over six million dollars</a>,
 and investment continues to pour into the sector. And while queer folks
 â€” specifically, queer women and nonbinary people like me â€” are no 
more likely to outright believe in astrology than the rest of the 
population, we are significantly <a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/believe-it-or-not-only-28-of-queer-women-believe-in-astrology-but-50-check-their-horoscopes-anyway-434287/" rel="noreferrer">more likely to be â€œopen to it.â€</a> </p>
<p>As Pride month cranks into high gear and corporations scramble to 
transform my communityâ€™s feelings of otherness into profit, I felt 
compelled to examine why astrology occupies the space it does in queer 
culture, especially amongst young and newly-out folks, with an eye 
towards how open we should be towards it, anyway.</p>
<p>For answers, I turned to Aida Manduley, a queer therapist based in 
Boston with 10 years of experience in mental health crisis support and 
six years of social work practice with individuals and couples/folx in 
multi-partner intimate relationships. Often, they say, LGBTQIA+ folks 
donâ€™t get adequate care from therapists, â€œand I have so much 
compassion for people that pursue astrologers and spiritual folks when 
therapists fail them.â€</p>
<p>The ways in which mental health professionals fail queer and trans folks range from ignorance to outright rejection (<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/27/475939114/tennessee-enacts-law-letting-therapists-refuse-patients-on-religious-grounds" rel="noreferrer">which, in at least one U.S. state, is actually legal</a>).
 I myself have experienced years of hurtful misunderstandings on the 
couch with professionals who mistook my gender dysphoria for 
garden-variety anxiety, advising mindfulness practices that only 
increased my awareness of my suffering while failing to address its 
source. </p>
<p>Once, a therapist tried to normalize my confusion and discomfort 
during sex with men as a â€œcommonâ€ experience for "young women." With
 therapists jumping to dysphoria â€”Â which isn't that common â€”Â and 
completely disregarding my gender identity (which is not a woman), is it
 any wonder that my community would seek alternative means of healing 
via astrology?</p>
<figcaption>Olena Ruban/Moment/Getty Images</figcaption><p>However, 
Manduley cautions that astrology can be detrimental to your mental 
health if followed to the exclusion of other therapeutic practices or 
used to justify damaging behaviors. â€œSometimes, people lean into 
characteristics that hurt others because, oh, that's just my Aquarius 
rising,â€ they say. â€œI'm like â€”Â no, those are your childhood 
traumas making you be an asshole.â€</p>
<p>At least <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674196?seq=1" rel="noreferrer">one study</a>
 backs Manduley up on this, in which participants who received negative 
horoscopes were more likely to behave indulgently afterward, perhaps to 
preemptively compensate for the crappy days they were told that theyâ€™d
 have.</p>
<p>Manduley says putting too much stock in predictive astrological 
phenomena like Mercury retrogrades can also trigger hypervigilance in 
people with anxiety. Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Cultural-Competency/Mental-Health-Disparities/Mental-Health-Facts-for-LGBTQ.pdf" rel="noreferrer">LGBTQIA+ folx are disproportionately likely to be anxious</a>, therefore potentially more susceptible to forking over cash to astrologers to comfort their fears.</p>
<p>Beyond the cost to our wellbeing, thereâ€™s also the hit to our wallets. Annually, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/28/astrology-in-the-age-of-uncertainty" rel="noreferrer">Americans spend about $2.2 billion on â€œmystical services.â€</a> And generally speaking, queers are not flush with cash. <a href="https://www.hrc.org/news/new-data-shows-black-lgbtq-people-disproportionately-suffer-adverse-economi" rel="noreferrer">Black queer and trans folk were hit extra hard</a> economically during the pandemic, and LGBTQIA+ people are <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/the-lives-and-livelihoods-of-many-in-the-lgbtq-community-are-at-risk-amidst-covid-19-crisis" rel="noreferrer">more likely than the general population to live in poverty</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to paying for astrology, Manduley says to scrutinize 
whatâ€™s offered. Curious questions and conversations that help <a href="https://www.mic.com/p/why-astrology-can-be-a-coping-mechanism-according-to-psychologists-19635844">navigate your spiritual and emotional growth</a>? Helpful. â€œBut if someone is predicting? Run.â€</p>
<p>They also suggest considering an astrologerâ€™s demographic. â€œIf 
they are catering to a small minority of people who have a lot of 
disposable income, it means their [ability] to ask good questions is 
limited.â€ Itâ€™s worth noting here that, in most cases, anyone in the 
U.S. capable of throwing down money for a chart reading has likely got 
disposable income on their hands. In this country, almost all astrology 
is at some level geared to the rich.</p>
<p>But what about queers who came to the stars, as I did, for a sense of
 belonging? Iâ€™d hoped that astrology would help me feel "gay enough" 
for the love Iâ€™d moved to California to find. And if capitalism is 
good at anything, itâ€™s offering quick fixes for feelings of 
inadequacy.</p>
<p>But as Manduley noted, thereâ€™s nothing inherently gay about 
astrology. In fact, â€œwhen we start to exclude people because they 
don't fit our idea of what queerness is, we're doing a disservice to 
inclusion in the community that could give us more political power.â€ 
Itâ€™s this lack of power in the culture at large, after all, thatâ€™s 
wounded my community so deeply that weâ€™ve attached ourselves to a 
practice that consistently over-promises on its ability to heal us.</p>
<p>So I broke up with astrology. Sometimes I still think about her, 
though, calculating aspects or puzzling over transits. Recently, I even 
found myself having what felt like an astrological epiphany during 
therapy. Iâ€™d been discussing my tendency to self-criticize when I 
deviate from a plan, and how it conflicts with another tendency toward 
impulsivity. Sun in Virgo, I thought, and Sagittarius Rising!</p>
<p>I was so wrapped up in the tragedy of my natal chart that I almost 
missed what my therapist was saying: that over-planning and 
impulsiveness were behaviors borne of trauma, and if I wanted to address
 those issues, Iâ€™d have to connect with what had happened inside of me
 when I was younger, not with what the planets were doing outside of me 
when I was born.</p>
<p>For me, that work is best supported by a good therapist, 
antidepressants, and testosterone shots. Iâ€™ll probably always have an 
affection for astrology, but Iâ€™ve learned that when it comes to 
healing, some things just shouldnâ€™t be outsourced to the stars, no 
matter how gay you are.</p>
