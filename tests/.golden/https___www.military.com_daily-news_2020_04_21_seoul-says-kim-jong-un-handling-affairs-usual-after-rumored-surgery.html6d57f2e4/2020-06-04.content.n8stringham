<span>Seoul Says Kim Jong Un Handling Affairs as Usual After Rumored Surgery</span> </h1>

<p class="rm-manual"> <span>The Canadian Press</span> </p>
<p>SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appeared to be 
handling state affairs as usual, South Korea's government said Tuesday 
after unconfirmed rumors described him as in fragile condition after 
surgery.</p>
<p>The presidential Blue House said no unusual activity has been 
detected in North Korea and it had no information about the rumors on 
Kim’s health. Speculation often surfaces about North Korea’s leadership 
based on attendance at important state events. Kim, who is in his 
mid-30s, missed the celebration of his late grandfather and state 
founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, the country’s most important holiday.</p>
<p>But he had presided over a meeting April 11, discussing coronavirus 
prevention and electing his sister as an alternate member of the 
political bureau of the ruling Workers’ Party. And state media have 
since reported Kim sent greetings to Syrian President Bashar Assad and 
Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel as well as “birthday spreads” to two 
North Korean officials and a new centenarian.</p>
<p>“We have no information to confirm regarding rumors about Chairman 
Kim Jong Un’s health issue that have been reported by some media 
outlets. Also, no unusual developments have been detected inside North 
Korea,” Blue House spokesman Kang Min-seok said in the statement.</p>
<p>The Blue House later said Kim was believed to be staying at an 
unspecified location outside of Pyongyang with some of his close 
confidants. The office said Kim appeared to be normally engaged with 
state affairs and there weren't any unusual movement or emergency 
reaction from the North’s ruling party, military or cabinet.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said the White House was aware before the reports 
appeared late Monday that Kim’s health might be precarious. The official
 said the U.S. had information that Kim may have undergone surgery and 
that complications may have rendered him “incapacitated or worse.” But, 
the official stressed that the U.S. had nothing to confirm the surgery 
had taken place or that any complications had occurred.</p>
<p>The U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter 
publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, would not elaborate on 
where the information came from or when it had been received. The White 
House and State Department had no comment.</p>
<p>Conservative South Korean lawmaker Yoon Sang-hyun, chairman of the 
National Assembly’s foreign affairs and unification committee, said he 
was told by unspecified non-government sources that Kim had surgery over
 cardiovascular problems. But an official from Seoul’s National 
Intelligence Service, who didn’t want to be named, citing office rules, 
said the spy agency couldn’t confirm whether Kim had surgery.</p>
<p>Kim In-chul, spokesman of South Korea’s Foreign Ministry, said Seoul 
and Washington are maintaining close communication but didn’t provide a 
direct answer when asked whether the allies exchanged any meaningful 
intelligence about Kim’s health.</p>
<p>Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said his government was monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>A political upheaval in North Korea would be unlikely even if Kim 
became sidelined by health problems, according to analyst Cheong 
Seong-Chang at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea.</p>
<p>Cheong said Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, is already exercising 
significant influence within the government and that most members of 
Pyongyang’s leadership share an interest with the Kim family in 
maintaining the North’s system.</p>
<p>Outside governments and media have a mixed record on tracking 
developments among North Korea’s ruling elite, made difficult by 
Pyongyang’s stringent control of information about them.</p>
<p>In 2016, South Korea media quoted intelligence officials as saying 
Kim Jong Un had had a former military chief executed for corruption and 
other charges. But North Korea’s state media months later showed Ri Yong
 Gil alive and serving in new senior posts.</p>
<p>Kim’s absence from state media often triggers speculation. In 2014, 
Kim vanished from the public eye for nearly six weeks before reappearing
 with a cane. South Korea’s spy agency said days later that he had a 
cyst removed from his ankle.</p>
<p>Kim, believed to be 36, took power upon his father’s death in 
December 2011 and is the third generation of his family to rule the 
nuclear-armed country.</p>
<p>Kim met President Donald Trump three times in 2018 and 2019 and had 
summits with other Asian leaders as he pursued diplomacy in hopes of 
ending crippling sanctions and getting security guarantees. But he 
maintained his right to a nuclear arsenal and most diplomacy has 
stalemated since.</p>
