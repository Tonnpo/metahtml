<figcaption class="rm-manual"> President Trump in the Oval Office, April 27, 2017. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) </figcaption><p><span>His views have been consistent in some key ways.</span> </p>
<p><span>C</span>ontrary to the claims of his critics and supporters 
alike, there is at least one area in which Donald Trump’s views have 
been consistent over the decades: political economy. There are a few 
lodestars to his worldview here, most prominently the power of ego, the 
idea that economic activity cannot be win-win, and a deep suspicion of 
economic competition.</p>
<p>Trump attributes all success — not only in business, but also the 
charity work of Mother Teresa and the mission of Jesus Christ— to “ego.”
 By the same token, failure comes from a lack of ego, and the recipe for
 doing better is “egotizing.” In 1990 Playboy interview he connected 
this concept directly to economic policy:</p>
<p>I think our country needs more ego, because it is being ripped off so
 badly by our so-called allies; i.e., Japan, West Germany, Saudi Arabia,
 South Korea, etc. They have literally outegotized this country, because
 they rule the greatest money machine ever assembled and it’s sitting on
 our backs. Their products are better because they have so much subsidy.
 We Americans are laughed at around the world for losing $150 billion 
year after year, for defending wealthy nations for nothing, nations that
 would be wiped off the face of the earth in about 15 minutes if it 
weren’t for us. Our “allies” are making billions screwing us.</p>
<p>As a younger man, Trump was extremely concerned about Japanese 
business success. He believed that, when it comes to real estate, “the 
Japanese will pay more than it’s worth just to screw us.” The fact that 
Americans would therefore be paid more for those buildings did not 
change Trump’s calculations: “If I ever wanted to sell any of my 
properties, I’d have a field day. But it’s an embarrassment!”</p>
<p>The familiar Trumpian theme of “losing” shows up here, but 
interestingly he seemed to consider American sales to the Japanese just 
as damaging as the imports from abroad he warns of today: “The Japanese 
double-screw the US, a real trick: First they take all our money with 
their consumer goods, then they put it back in buying all of Manhattan. 
So either way, we lose.” So if Americans are getting products from the 
Japanese for money, he characterizes that as the Japanese “taking” money
 rather than the Americans getting goods. But when the Japanese buy 
American real estate, it is the Japanese getting buildings rather than 
Americans “taking” money.</p>
<p>He does not limit this thinking to international trade alone, given 
his animus today toward Amazon, an American company that does billions 
of dollars of business in the United States. While Trump is likely 
driven by envy of Jeff Bezos’s fortune and anger at Bezos’s ownership of
 the “fake” Washington Post, the arguments Trump makes against the 
company aim to deny it a “win” by attributing its success to cheating 
the postal service (claims that do not seem to hold up).</p>
<p>In the decades since Trump’s Playboy interview, China’s turn from 
Marxist-Leninist economics led it to high economic growth and global 
economic power, whereas the burst of the 1980s bubble economy in Japan 
brought on an economic stagnation. With this development, China seems to
 have displaced Japan in Trump’s view of the economic landscape. This 
suggests that the president’s current focus on China could shift to the 
next rising power. Should Trump begin railing against Indian trade 
practices, it would disappoint Peter Navarro but would be in line with 
the current of his thinking.</p>
<p>Asked in 1990 about the first thing he would do in an imaginary world
 where he became president, Donald Trump responded, “Many things. A 
toughness of attitude would prevail. I’d throw a tax on every 
Mercedes-Benz rolling into this country and on all Japanese products, 
and we’d have wonderful allies again.” (How did Trump see himself 
achieving the presidency? As a Democrat, because “the working guy would 
elect me. He likes me.”) With <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/china-trump-trade-war-consequences-american-people/" rel="noopener">the substitution of Chinese products for Japanese</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/donald-trump-100-percent-motorcycle-tariff-claim/" rel="noopener">Triumph motorcycles for Mercedes-Benz cars</a>,
 this is what is happening 28 years later. Trade wars show “toughness,” 
but instead of having “wonderful allies again,” the U.S. is facing 
retaliation from China and Europe alike.</p>
<p>Trump’s appreciation of “toughness” seems to be linked to his belief 
in ego. He argues that Soviet negotiators and Chinese crackdowns after 
the Tiananmen Square protests showed toughness, which the U.S. lacks, 
allowing it to be “pushed around by everyone.” Fleshing this out, he 
explained in the same interview that a hypothetical President Trump 
“would believe very strongly in extreme military strength. He wouldn’t 
trust anyone. He wouldn’t trust the Russians; He wouldn’t trust our 
allies.” This show of toughness, which would be implemented through 
businessmen negotiating foreign policy, would ensure “respect around the
 world.” Again, this seems to be in keeping with the practice of the 
actual Trump administration, with Rex Tillerson taking the place of the 
1980s business figures Trump was speaking of at the time. As with the 
trade policies, this has backfired in practice.</p>
<p>He has stuck to these beliefs decade after decade, regardless of where the facts fall.</p>
<p>Trump has always viewed himself as an outsider — as a working-class 
guy who just happened to make it big, in a way that recalls England’s 
Alan Sugar (who, incidentally, hosts The Apprentice in the U.K.). Sugar,
 like Trump, is the grandchild of immigrants and grew up in an outer 
borough (Hackney, to Trump’s Queens), though where Fred Trump was a 
multimillionaire, Sugar’s father was a tailor in East London’s garment 
industry. The two even share a trajectory, including a recent party 
defection: from Democratic/Labour to Republican/Conservative. But Sugar,
 a tech investor, holds a much more conventional view in favor of free 
enterprise.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> {{/each}} </p>
<p>Would-be Trump interpreters seem to have broadly fallen into two 
camps: There are the nationalist intellectuals, who attribute Trump’s 
actions to a (mostly projected) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/opinion/trump-tariffs-economics.html" rel="noopener">philosophical backing</a>
 in the hopes of achieving American dirigisme, and there are those who 
seize on his apparent ideological vacuum as an opportunity to guide the 
president toward a more conventional GOP platform. Neither is right. 
Trump does have a defined set of economic views, contrary to the second 
group’s assumption, but these are not quite views the nationalists 
share. Honest economic nationalists prioritize their industrial program 
even if it means a shrinking of the economy; on the contrary, Trump 
boasts of economic growth, even if he does not seem clear on what causes
 it.</p>
<p>He has stuck to these beliefs decade after decade, regardless of 
where the facts fall. Both those who seek to oppose the Trump presidency
 and those who want to achieve their own agendas through it ought to be 
aware of this. Trump’s views are an open book; supporters of his 
candidacy who’ve recoiled at his economics should not have been 
surprised.</p>
