power generation, and engineering services companies, while tripling the

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“We want a business that can

<p><span><span><span><span>-- Chutinant Bhirombhakdi, Chairman, Singha Estate PCL</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Singha Estate PCL (S), a leading Thai property 
investment and development company, today, announced that it has secured
 the exclusive rights to acquire a 30% shareholding in three major 
co-generation power plants with total capacity of 400 megawatts, at par 
value, and with a total investment of Bht 1,392 million.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The first of the plants is an operational 123 
megawatt (MW) combined cycle co-generation power plant that is owned and
 operated by Angthong Power Company Limited and located in the ‘World 
Food Valley’ industrial estate in Ang Thong, Central Thailand.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The second and third plants, each with 140 MW 
capacity, are greenfield operations that are currently under 
construction and will enter into service in 2023. They are also located 
in the ‘World Food Valley’ industrial estate. The licences for these 
power plants are owned by B.Grimm Power (Ratchaburi) 1 Limited and 
B.Grimm Power (Ratchaburi) 2 Limited.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The three acquisitions are subject to Singha Estate’s shareholders’ approval at its Annual General Meeting on April 23, 2021.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Chutinant Bhirombhakdi, Chairman of the Board of 
Directors of Singha Estate PCL, said, “We have secured these rights 
under very attractive terms. They are an important part of the jigsaw 
that will make Singha Estate into one of Thailand’s foremost property, 
power generation, and engineering services companies, while tripling the
 size of our business to Bt20 billion in revenues in three years.” </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Singha Estate recently announced that 2021 is a 
transition year for the company in which it is moving into the next 
phase of its development by embracing businesses that complement its 
three core property businesses that are comprised of commercial 
property, residential property, and resorts and hotels.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>“We want a business that can become huge, combining
 steady, consistent returns with exciting growth opportunities. We will 
leverage the synergies between our four business platforms to give us 
great competitive strength,” Bhirombhakdi said.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Thitima Rungkwansiriroj, Chief Executive Officer, 
Singha Estate PCL, said, “Licences for power generation plants of this 
size are a very rare commodity, so we are especially pleased to have 
secured rights to a substantial stake in three important power plants. 
They will give us an immediate and sure-footed presence in this sector.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>“Our options are made particularly attractive by 
the fact that 270 MW, or close to 70 per cent of the combined output of 
the three power plants, is already pre-sold at guaranteed prices. This 
assures us sustainable recurring revenues that will enhance the 
resilience of our business,” she added.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>According to Rungkwansiriroj, Angthong Power is the
 only power plant in Thailand that is profitable even without the need 
to sell to independent users and that 75 per cent of its output is taken
 up through a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Electricity 
Generating Authority of Thailand. She noted that “the use of advanced 
technology has reduced costs and further improved the margins of the 
business beyond initial estimates.” </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The three power plants are expected to generate Bt7,500 million in revenues in 2024.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>“Apart from the synergy benefits that we foresee 
from these acquisitions, their returns as stand-alone businesses are 
also attractive. We have a draw-down facility with banks so that Singha 
Estate only needs to put up minimal capital, and at the tail end under a
 ‘back-end equity’ arrangement,” Rungkwansiriroj said.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Singha Estate has a low net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.96 and access to Bt25 billion in credit facilities.</span></span></span></p>
