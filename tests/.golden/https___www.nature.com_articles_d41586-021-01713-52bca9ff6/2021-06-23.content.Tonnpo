<h2><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w">How humans learnt to love carbs</a></h2>
<p>The people who built the ancient monumental structures at Turkey’s 
Göbekli Tepe were fuelled by vat-fulls of starchy porridge and stew, not
 just meaty feasts. Archaeologists are uncovering evidence that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w">ancient people were grinding grains for hearty, starchy dishes</a> long before we domesticated crops. These discoveries shred the long-standing idea that early people subsisted mainly on meat.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/childrens-birthdays-may-have-spread-covid-infections/">Birthdays might have helped to spread COVID</a></h2>
<p>Birthday celebrations might have boosted the spread of COVID-19. 
Researchers looked at data from almost three million households in the 
United States, where public-health mandates did not ban people from 
meeting up at home. In areas with a lot of cases, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/childrens-birthdays-may-have-spread-covid-infections/">households in which someone had a birthday saw a </a><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/childrens-birthdays-may-have-spread-covid-infections/">31% increase in the prevalence of infection in the following two week</a><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/childrens-birthdays-may-have-spread-covid-infections/">s</a>,
 compared with households that did not have a birthday. If it was a 
child’s birthday, that went up to 57%. “It is a big endorsement, in 
retrospect, of the gains among those who skipped all sorts of social 
gatherings,” says public-health researcher Donald Redelmeier. “During a 
pandemic, it is okay to be a party pooper.”</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/living-fossil-could-reach-100-years-old">Coelacanths can live to 100</a></h2>
<p>The African coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) — called ‘living fossils’ because of their prehistoric lineage — <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/living-fossil-could-reach-100-years-old">can live to be up to 100 years old</a>.
 Their longevity might partly explain why the fish are so rare: they 
don’t reach sexual maturity until they’re around 50 years old and 
pregnancy lasts at least 5 years. Coelacanths are endangered and were 
thought to be extinct until 1938.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01678-5">Speed up grants for global vaccination</a></h2>
<p>International financial institutions say that vaccines are the highest-return investment on Earth — so <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01678-5">it is past time for them to pay up, argues development economist Justin Sandefur</a>.
 The World Bank entered the pandemic with both the money and the mandate
 to quickly finance a global vaccination drive, yet it has dragged its 
feet. “The bank must soften the terms of its loans for health systems 
and unleash more of its $12 billion pledge as grants for vaccine 
procurement,” writes Sandefur. “The longer it waits, the less good its 
money will do.”</p>

<p>Economist Max Roser discusses how his website Our World in Data <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/max-roser-our-world-in-data/">went from a small non-profit organization focused on global development data to a go-to resource for COVID-19 information</a>.
 “I think the thing that changed it for me was really just how difficult
 it was to access the data,” he recounts. “And the focus wasn’t on the 
growth rate. And I was going mad. I just couldn’t believe how poor this 
reporting was.”</p>

<h2>Where I work</h2>
<p><span>Bernardo Reyes-Tur is a professor of conservation biology at University Oriente in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba.</span><span>Credit: Bruno D’Amicis</span></p>
<p>Conservation biologist Bernardo Reyes-Tur studies the six species of 
Polymita, known as painted snails, which are endemic to eastern Cuba and
 are in danger of extinction. “You can find their shells for sale on 
eBay… despite laws banning such trade,” he says. Their laboratory living
 spaces: plastic one-litre water bottles left behind by tourists. “My 
motto is a Cuban saying: “We have the ‘no’, and therefore always have to
 look for the ‘yes’,” says Reyes-Tur. “In other words, there is always 
another way, if you keep looking.”</p>
