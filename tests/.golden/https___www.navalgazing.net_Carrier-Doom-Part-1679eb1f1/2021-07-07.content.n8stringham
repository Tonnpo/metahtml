<h1 class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Carrier-Doom-Part-1">Why the Carriers Are Not Doomed Part 1</a></h1>
<p>Claims that US carriers are very vulnerable to missile attack, and 
will be sunk immediately in any upcoming war, are quite common. They’re 
also wrong. The carriers are surprisingly survivable, and the prowess of
 missiles is usually grossly exaggerated. </p>
<p> <span> <span>USS Nimitz, USS Ronald Reagan and USS Theodore Roosevelt operating together, November 2017</span></span></p>
<p>The first line of defense is the fact that the sea is very 
big[Citation Needed] and ships are small and mobile. Obviously, improved
 radar and modern navigational systems have made it easier to <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Information-Communication-and-Naval-Warfare-Part-1">find and track ships at sea</a>
 since WWII. Clouds and darkness are no longer serious obstacles, and 
it’s harder (though not impossible) to mess up your navigation. But 
there are still problems. A typical radar system will tell you that 
there is something there, but it won’t tell you what it is. You can make
 guesses based on where contacts are, but a smart opponent will do all 
he can to frustrate this. Carrier groups, for instance, never operate in
 the “bullseye” formation made famous in photos, and often do their best
 to look like merchant traffic.<a href="#fn1_1">1</a> </p>
<p> <span> <span>The George Washington Battle Group demonstrating the bullseye formation</span></span></p>
<p>The preferred way to solve the identification problem is <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Electronic-Warfare-Part-1">electronic signal measures (ESM)</a>.
 At the most basic, if there is a radar that is only installed on 
carriers, and you detect it coming from a ship, then you know it’s a 
carrier. On a more sophisticated level, most military radars are 
essentially hand-built, and it is possible to take a ‘fingerprint’ and 
identify a specific radar remotely. The US, Russia, and China all have 
sea-surveillance ESM satellites. However, these can be defeated by 
emissions control, or EMCON.<a href="#fn1_2">2</a> While this obviously limits a ship’s capabilities, <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Signalling-Part-4">satellite communications</a>
 allow ships to avoid most of the disadvantages of EMCON. A satellite 
can transmit to the surface over a broad area, and a ship can send a 
tight beam back to the satellite, which is very difficult to intercept. 
The ship can rely on data from remote sensors (including ESM and IR 
satellites) to learn of an incoming attack, and only break EMCON after 
it thinks it has been located. </p>
<p> <span> <span>A long-duration exposure showing a pair of US Naval Ocean Surveillance Satellites</span></span></p>
<p>But what about other alternatives? Optical cameras don’t require 
cooperation from the target, but are stymied by clouds and darkness. IR 
cameras can't see through the atmosphere to sea level very well. Modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar" rel="nofollow">Synthetic Aperture Radar</a> (SAR) platforms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TerraSAR-X" rel="nofollow">TerraSAR-X</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TanDEM-X" rel="nofollow">TanDEM-X</a>
 are quite capable of identifying ships from space. However, they can 
only see a limited swath of the ocean, particularly in the 
higher-resolution modes that are required to get firm identification. 
The combined TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X cost approximately $400 million. Jane’s
 says that it can image 90% of Earth’s surface within 2 days, although 
there are several different resolution modes and I don't know exactly 
how this was calculated.<a href="#fn1_3">3</a> The X-band radar used is badly affected by rain,<a href="#fn1_4">4</a> and <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/The-Reagan-Maritime-Strategy">the US used to hide ships from Soviet radar satellites in bad weather</a>. I’m not sure how effective electronic warfare is against this kind of system, and sources differ on the matter. </p>
<p> <span> <span>TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X in formation</span></span></p>
<p>But what about non-space-based options? Can’t we just send out planes or drones to look for the carriers? </p>
<p>The obvious problem we come to again is emissions. A radar can 
usually be detected at least twice as far away as it can detect 
anything. The obvious solution for the carrier is to use some form of 
low-power low probability of intercept (LPI) radio to vector fighters 
out to kill the snooper, or even simply brief them on deck and send them
 out under full EMCON. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_E-2_Hawkeye" rel="nofollow">E-2 Hawkeye</a>
 has a very good ESM system, and with tankers and cleverness, could 
manage to at the very least significantly mitigate the ‘flaming datum’ 
problem. Optical surveillance, besides being flummoxed by clouds, has a 
very limited range compared to radar, and is best used for identifying 
targets found by radar. The obvious suggestion is drones, but drones 
have issues of their own. A search plane could be sent out under EMCON 
with orders to only report back if they find something. This isn’t 
really viable for drones, which can then be shot down on the basis of 
their transmissions.<a href="#fn1_5">5</a> Also, drones of the size necessary for effective sea surveillance are large and relatively expensive. </p>
<p> <span> <span>An E-2D Hawkeye</span></span></p>
<p>But eventually, the carrier’s luck will run out, and the bad guys will locate them, and they’ll die, right? </p>
<p>Not so fast. A location, particularly one that is targeting-grade, is
 inherently perishable, and if your opponent knows you’ve got it, then 
it’s going to spoil even more quickly. Essentially, you have to get your
 weapons near the target before the area where the target can be gets 
bigger than the area the weapons can search, and then make sure that 
those weapons lock on to the right target. This is true regardless of 
the nature of the weapons, although different weapons have very 
different parameters for search and lock-on. One example would be an air
 strike. Spending a lot of time searching for the carrier is a good way 
to get killed by defending fighters, but the attacking aircraft can 
still compensate for some degree of imprecision in the fix, and make 
sure the target they're going after is what they want to hit instead of 
something else that happened to be nearby. </p>
<p> <span> <span>An F-14 intercepting a Tu-95 Bear</span></span></p>
<p>A missile is much less capable of such compensation, and this has 
been a long-term problem with anti-ship missiles. The US has stopped 
installing <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Harpoon">Harpoon missiles</a>
 (range of ~70 nm) on destroyers, and removed the submarine-launched 
version from service, out of fear of hitting the wrong target. The 
original <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Tomahawk-Part-2">Tomahawk Anti-Ship Missile</a>,
 which had an effective range of over 200 nm, was going to solve this 
problem by using ESM, looking for the radars of a hostile ship. However,
 this was problematic, and in exercises, the hit rate was around 25%. 
Some Soviet missiles had datalinks to allow updates after launch, but 
these required a platform within sensor range of the target. </p>
<p> <span> <span>Iowa launching a Harpoon</span></span></p>
<p>Ballistic missiles have an even bigger problem. Unlike a cruise 
missile, they cannot wait and search for a target. The first ASBM, the 
Soviet SS-NX-13, was designed to home in on radar emissions, but never 
entered service, as it would have displaced ballistic missiles on 
submarines, the numbers of which were limited by treaty. The guidance 
mechanism of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DF-21#DF-21D" rel="nofollow">DF-21D</a>
 is not known, but there are only a few options. Optical guidance is 
right out, as it doesn’t work at night or in bad weather. IR does work 
at night, but is still vulnerable to bad weather, a common problem at 
sea. Radar might work, but is vulnerable to countermeasures and there 
are limits on what can be done with a platform the size of a missile 
warhead, particularly in terms of <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Electronic-Warfare-Part-3">non-cooperative identification</a>. In plain English, the missile can’t tell the carrier from a destroyer with a blip enhancer or a merchantman. <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Anti-Radiation-Missiles">Home-on-radar</a> is an option, but can be foiled by not using radar or using a different kind of radar than the missile is expecting.<a href="#fn1_6">6</a> </p>
<p> <span> <span>A DF-21D missile</span></span></p>
<p>All of this gives a very limited window for the attacker to take a 
targeting-grade sighting and get the data to the weapons. This is 
usually ignored in popular articles, but it’s very important. Every 
minute, a carrier at full speed gets another ~900 m away from the 
initial fix. The internet makes instant, reliable communication seem 
easy, but the list of outages and failures due to various bad actors 
should be a reminder that this kind of communication is difficult and 
vulnerable to disruption. Throw in an active and very hostile power, and
 the network is likely to be seriously disrupted at best, and brought 
down at worst. China might have made the investment in targeting 
platforms and communications to be able to effectively target something 
like the DF-21D, although we can’t be sure how well their efforts will 
work until it’s tried for real. Enemyistan almost certainly hasn’t. 
Early US attempts at this kind of targeting often saw data delayed by an
 hour or more, and they were not facing the full array of 
countermeasures that a major power can bring to bear. If the delay is 
too great, then there’s nothing in the missile’s field of view when it 
shows up, and it either plunges into the sea or takes out something it 
thinks is a carrier, but turns out to be a Danish <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Merchant-Ships-Container-Ships">container ship</a>. </p>
<p> <span> <span>A Danish container ship</span></span></p>
<p>None of this should be taken to mean that the US carriers are 
completely safe from detection. There are ways to find ships at sea, but
 they are expensive and difficult, and their effectiveness can’t be 
absolutely certain. That said, these problems are an important part of 
the equation, and someone who ignores them when discussing the matter 
should not be taken seriously. </p>
<p>The difficulty of finding the carrier is only the first line of defense. <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Carrier-Doom-Part-2">Next time</a>, I'll discuss the active defenses a carrier can mount to an attack. </p>
<p><span>1</span> See <a href="http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-031.php" rel="nofollow">this article</a> for a more detailed explanation of how this is done. <a href="#fnr1_1">⇑</a> </p>
<p><span>2</span> Basically, you just don't use the radio or radar. This is common practice in western navies. <a href="#fnr1_2">⇑</a> </p>
<p><span>3</span> The best data I have suggests that you can get data 
between 20 and 45 degrees off-nadir, which translates into the ability 
to look at areas between 170 and 460 km off the ground track, on one 
side. This is probably enough to fix and identify a carrier that has 
already been roughly located, although the finer modes have swath widths
 of only 10-30 km. <a href="#fnr1_3">⇑</a> </p>

 of curiosity, how much easier does finding a carrier in war time get if
 you have a spy among the crew? Carrier crews are big enough to have 
drug-dealers and prostitution rings, so it is not that unlikely.</p> </span> </li>

 not sure. You could definitely give someone a homing beacon, and they 
could almost certainly smuggle it onboard, but I'm sure that the Navy 
has thought of this and probably has some ESM equipment dedicated to 
picking up any signal. If nothing else, the Hawkeye flies over 
occasionally and listens. Also, there's the issue that the spy would 
know they're on a major target, which isn't good for morale.</p> </span> </li>

 your agent smuggle the homing beacon on board just before he transfers 
off the ship. That way he doesn't stay on board the target. (Where it 
could be hidden is left as an exercise for someone who knows a LOT more 
about carriers than I do.)</li> <li class="rm-manual">Tell your agent 
that the purpose is tracking the ship during peacetime. Which is 
probably what it would be used for. ALMOST all the time.</li> <li class="rm-manual">Your
 beacon doesn't put out a signal until it receives a wake-up a signal 
that your ship/aircraft/missile has sent out. So listening for such as 
signal doesn't help until it's been activated, at which point it may be 
too late. (There are ways of detecting radio circuits that work even 
when they are unpowered, but if you know about such things there are 
ways to stealth them up too.)</li> </ul> </span> </li>
<li class="rm-manual"> <span>May 20, 2021</span><span>ike said...</span> <span><p class="rm-manual">Would
 it even need to be a ship-to-ship signal? I don't know much about 
technology, but I would think that something that periodically emailed 
its GPS coordinates to plan@gmail.com wouldn't be too large or 
expensive.</p> </span> </li>
<li class="rm-manual"> <span>May 20, 2021</span><span>Lambert said...</span> <span><p class="rm-manual">There's
 no internet connection in the open ocean apart from via satellite. I 
assume ships have some way to officially connect to the internet via 
Iridium or DoD comsats but they'd never let random sailors use it to 
send unvetted messages during wartime. You could try to smuggle your own
 satphone on board but I hope the SIGINT people would notice if you 
tried to use it. Also they don't work so well when you're inside a big 
metal box so you'd have to transmit from the deck. </p> </span> </li>
<li class="rm-manual"> <span>May 20, 2021</span><span>bean said...</span> <span><p class="rm-manual">I
 wouldn't totally rule out smuggling a beacon aboard, but I think the 
risks of it being discovered are too high for them to count on this. 
Email is definitely out, as they'll be monitoring that and locking it 
down in wartime. And I'm very sure that the USN's security people are 
already several levels deeper on this than we can get.</p> </span> </li>
<li class="rm-manual"> <span>May 20, 2021</span><span>Ian Argent said...</span> <span><p class="rm-manual">A hidden beacon smuggled aboard is a movie-plot level threat. I laugh in its face "HAHAHAHAHAHA"</p> <p class="rm-manual">Let
 me tell you of my experiences using FRS radios aboard a cruise ship. 
They had maybe 50 yards range below decks, and the batteries (expensive 
lithium cells) barely lasted the cruise (and were mostly in standby 
during the period). (Which is why we ended up buying the internet 
package last time - it meant we could use IMs and VoIP to communicate.)</p> <p class="rm-manual">A
 beacon hidden in the bilges is worthless, and even one up on deck needs
 a honking big power pack to be worthwhile. Physics hates this plan.</p> <p class="rm-manual">And then the CVBG's emissions checks when they go to EMCON detect it anyway.</p> </span> </li>
<li class="rm-manual"> <span>May 20, 2021</span><span>John Schilling said...</span> <span><p class="rm-manual">Even
 if your beacon is cleverly designed to remain inert until the opportune
 moment, which is harder than it might seem, it's not going to work from
 inside a big metal box. It's going to need to have an antenna with a 
view of the sky. And if it's anywhere on the flight or hangar deck, it's
 going to be fairly quickly spotted on a FOD walk.</p> <p class="rm-manual">There
 might be a few places on the superstructure that don't get that 
treatment, but they're going to be small areas with restricted crew 
access and the crewmen with access will have a pretty good idea of what 
does or doesn't belong in their workspace.</p> </span> </li>
<li class="rm-manual"> <span>May 21, 2021</span><span>Blackshoe said...</span> <span><p class="rm-manual">As
 John notes, something that could be visible from space high up on the 
island that could respond to on-demand pinging from satellites is 
doable. Wouldn't even be hard to do, really. But (as John also notes!) 
there's a limited number of people who would have access to do it, and 
they'd be smart enough to know why it's being done. There's probably 
also EMI issues that are going to be hard to solve. </p> </span> </li>
<li class="rm-manual"> <span>May 21, 2021</span><span>bean said...</span> <span><blockquote class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual">There’s probably also EMI issues that are going to be hard to solve. </p> </blockquote> <p class="rm-manual">That's
 actually a really good point. China successfully figures out how to 
build and conceal a beacon so that nobody notices, tries to turn it on, 
and discovers that it was fried the first time the air-search radar was 
switched on.</p> <p class="rm-manual">(This isn't a joke. Naval aircraft
 have much higher standards for operating near radars and the like than 
their land-based counterparts because the radar is right next to them 
instead of sitting a ways away. This has caused problems when they've 
tried to operate Army helicopters from carriers.)</p> </span> </li>
