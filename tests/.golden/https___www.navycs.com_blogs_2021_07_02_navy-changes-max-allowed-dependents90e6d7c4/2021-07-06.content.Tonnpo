<p class="rm-manual">Written by <span><span>Thomas Goering</span>, <span>NCCM</span> <span>USN(RET)</span></span></p>
<p class="rm-manual">Published: July 2, 2021</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Updated: July 2, 2021</p>
<p>Effective yesterday, there has been a few changes to eligibility 
requirements for enlistment; specifically, to citizenship documents and 
status, to dependency, and two new ratings within the Hospital Corpsman 
rating now available at enlistment.</p>
<p>First, citizenship.</p>
<p>The shipping or gaining a permanent resident alien without a valid 
unexpired USCIS I-551 card is prohibited unless they possess an expired 
ten year USCIS I-551 card with a USCIS I-797 (Notice of Action-Issued) 
extending their expiration date of their 10 year USCIS I-551 card in 
their possession. Prior to this change, a person could not ship to 
boot-camp or be gained as a Reservist until a new unexpired I-551 card 
was recieved.</p>
<p>Conditional resident aliens with an expired 2 year card are not 
eligible for enlistment until they can obtain a 10 year permanent 
resident card or proof of citizenship.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.navycs.com/blogs/2011/02/02/navy-citizenship-requirements">To initially join, the rule remains the same</a>:
 A Permanent Resident Alien applicant must have an unexpired USCIS I-551
 issued on or after the person’s 14th birthday in their possession.</p>
<p>Dual Citizenship is no longer a show-stopper: Applicants holding dual
 citizenship status (i.e., a citizen of the United States and a citizen 
of another country) may not be used as a basis for, or a disqualifying 
factor in, determining an individual’s Personnel Reliability Program 
(PRP) eligibility provided the individual has a completed a favorably 
adjudicated investigation and meets all other eligibility requirements. 
Prior to this change, one would have to officially renouncement 
citizenship to the non-US country before being eligible.</p>
<p>Dependency. The total number of dependents a non-Prior Service applicant can have has been reduced. I have updated the <a href="https://www.navycs.com/blogs/2011/01/07/navy-dependency-waiver">Dependency Waiver article</a>
 to reflect the new standard. Previously, for instance, an unmarried or 
divorced Reserve Component applicant with four dependents was eligible 
with a waiver; now, the maximum dependents is three, and only two of 
those dependents can minors. I read that as a single applicant with 
three minor children would no longer be eligible. Similar changes have 
been made to the Active Duty dependent maximums. For an Active Duty 
married non-Prior Service applicant, the maximum is now three 
dependents; previously, four was the most one could have with an 
approved waiver.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.navycs.com/navy-jobs/hospital-corpsman.html">Hospital Corpsman rating</a>:
 opportunities now exist for those to enlist as Dental Hygienist(HMDH) 
and a Behavioral Health Technician(HMBHT). Both ratings share the same 
ASVAB requirement for HMDA (VE+MK+GS=156).</p>
<p>The HMDH rating is only accessible via the <a href="https://www.navycs.com/dpep.html">Direct Procurement Enlistment Program</a>
 (DPEP) (Because it is a DPEP, I do not know whether HMDH is a four year
 enlistment per DPEP instructions, or whether it is a five year 
enlistment to be inline with HM’s current minimum enlistment 
requirement).</p>
<p>The HMBHT, like the HM-ATF program, is a 72 month enlistment obligation. </p>
