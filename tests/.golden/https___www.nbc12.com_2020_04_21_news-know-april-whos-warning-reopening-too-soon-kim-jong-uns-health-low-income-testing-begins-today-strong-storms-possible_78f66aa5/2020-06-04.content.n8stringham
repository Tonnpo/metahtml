<h3> WHO’s Warning</h3>

announced aggressive reopening plans, while Boeing and at least one 
other U.S. heavy-equipment manufacturer resumed production. </p>

around the world, step-by-step reopenings were underway in Europe, where

<p>The Richmond and Henrico Health Districts will be <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/04/20/richmond-henrico-health-districts-offering-free-covid-testing-community-locations/">offering free COVID-19 testing this week to residents</a> in the Woodman West and Henrico Arms neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Health officials said if you live near these neighborhoods and are 
experiencing symptoms such as shortness of breath and cough or a fever, 
call the Health District hotline at 804-205-3501 for more information.</p>
<p>Other free COVID-19 testing is being offered to those who may not have insurance or whose insurance does not cover COVID-19.</p>
<figcaption> There's an effort underway to bring drive thru coronavirus 
testing to the areas that need it the most in Shreveport and Caddo 
Parish. (Source: KSLA) </figcaption><p>The purpose of the testing is to provide access to testing in vulnerable communities where residents may not have access.</p>

<p>Governor Ralph Northam made the announcement Monday during a 
coronavirus briefing in Richmond. Northam said as of Monday, the state 
does not have the testing materials to even consider phase one of 
lifting restrictions.</p>
<figcaption> Governor Ralph Northam begins a coronavirus briefing. (Source: WVIR) </figcaption><p>But
 the state is slowly increasing testing capabilities. Northam said 
that’s in part thanks to private and university labs stepping up. The 
state lab will also increase testing capacity per day thanks to new 
equipment from Altria. Northam said the key to lifting restrictions is 
to make sure the state has the testing capacity.</p>
<p>The state is expected to see its virus peak later this week.</p>
<h3> Earth Week In RVA</h3>
<p>Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney has <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/04/20/mayor-stoney-declares-it-earth-week-richmond/">declared April 20-24 Earth Week in Richmond</a>.</p>
