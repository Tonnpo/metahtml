<p class="rm-manual">By Kasie Hunt and Alex Moe</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Members of Congress are becoming increasingly anxious about <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/live-blog/coronavirus-updates-live-northern-italy-lockdown-anxiety-grows-d-c-n1152886">coronavirus</a>,
 and there is growing pressure on leadership to take steps to protect 
lawmakers — even potentially recessing for a period of weeks — two 
Democratic congressional sources said Sunday.</p>
<p>Multiple sources said anxiety was on the rise among lawmakers as more cases are reported and the virus spreads.</p>
<p>Several Republican lawmakers self-quarantined after discovering they 
came in contact with a person who is hospitalized with COVID-19, the 
disease caused by the virus, while attending the Conservative Political 
Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland.</p>
<p>Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Rep. Doug 
Collins of Georgia and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas are among those affected. 
Both Gaetz and Gosar closed their Washington offices. An aide for 
Collins told NBC News that in addition to the congressman, two staffers 
from his office are also self-quarantining.</p>
<p>Collins met with President Donald Trump last week during a visit to 
the CDC headquarters in Atlanta and Gaetz was on Air Force One with 
Trump on Monday. All four lawmakers said they are not experiencing 
symptoms but are acting out of caution.</p>
<p>"Members are very nervous," a senior Democratic leadership aide said.
 "There's a lot of concern that members could bring it home."</p>

<p>Another source said members from districts and states where the virus
 is spreading are also concerned about being able to remain at home to 
help handle the crisis.</p>
<p>Members plan to raise concerns with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 
D-Calif., at their weekly leadership meeting Monday afternoon, two 
sources said. It's Pelosi's decision whether to keep the House in 
session or make changes in the schedule.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Pelosi's office didn't respond to requests for comment Sunday night.</p>
<p>The House is scheduled to resume meeting this week after a weekend at
 home. Several offices said that by Sunday evening, there were no 
changes to the schedule. Members are expecting an update on the 
coronavirus at their usual caucus meeting Tuesday morning at the 
Capitol.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/white-house-gives-mixed-messages-on-coronavirus-response-80288837522">White House gives mixed messages on coronavirus response</a></h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span><span>March 8, 2020</span><span>01:54</span></span></p>
<p>And some members were urging Congress to stay the course to "show 
leadership in a time of great anxiety" and conduct oversight of the 
Trump administration's response.</p>
<p>Members should "follow the very advice we're giving the country: Wash
 our hands, avoid contact with anyone exhibiting symptoms, stay home if 
we're sick and ensure our staffs are doing the same," one lawmaker told 
NBC News.</p>
<p>But the virus is spreading rapidly, and the first case in Washington was announced Saturday night.</p>
<p>The Capitol building is open to scheduled public tours — tourists 
travel from all over the world to visit, and the Capitol Hill office 
buildings are open to members of the public, who can freely walk the 
hallways as long as they pass through a basic magnetometer screening.</p>

<p>Pelosi so far has been careful not to sound alarmist and has 
continued to rely on the advice of the Capitol physician in making 
decisions about the grounds. The top four congressional leaders in both 
parties — Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., 
Pelosi and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. — met with top Capitol building
 staff to discuss the coronavirus last week.</p>
<p>"You cannot test everybody who comes in the front door of the Capitol," Pelosi told reporters Thursday.</p>
<p>"It is unreasonable and probably in some ways not focused enough on 
what needs to be focused on," she said, adding that the office of the 
Capitol physician would be making the decisions on protocols.</p>
<p>Congress as a whole could be more susceptible to dangerous symptoms 
of the coronavirus than the public in general. Sixty-six senators are 
over 60 — two-thirds of the body — with more than a quarter over 70. The
 average age of House members is 57.6 years, according to the 
Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>Many members "are concerned, particularly older members and a number 
who have conditions that make them more susceptible," a source said.</p>
