<p>NEW DELHI: The coronavirus pandemic could bring Indian travel, 
tourism and aviation industries to a halt within next ten days, 
especially with the government suspending visas for a month, a move that
 could cause an immediate economic impact of at least Rs 8,500 crore, 
according to industry players.</p>
<p>Industry bodies, including Indian Association of Tour Operators 
(IATO), and ASSOCHAM, foresee job losses in the sectors as companies try
 to tide over the situation by removing non-essential work forces and 
stopping recruitment, while calling the government to review the 
decision to suspend visas for a month and allow inbound travel through 
limited gateway cities.</p>
<p>"The ban on travel to India for a period of one month will have a 
cascading economic impact and will lead to job losses in the entire 
hotel, aviation and travel sector.</p>
<p>We estimate that it will lead to direct loss of not less than Rs 8,500 crore," IATO Secretary Rajesh Mudgill said.</p>
<p>Assocham Tourism and Hospitality Council Chairman Subhash Goyal said 
since the outbreak of coronavirus, the aviation and tourism industries 
in India have been adversely affected.</p>
<p>"However, we were able to manage our expenses and keep the staff because some amount of essential travel was going on.</p>
<p>The suspension of visas last night has come as an immediate blow to 
the entire tourism, aviation and hospitality industry," he said.</p>
<p>Warning of the consequences of the step, Goyal said, "If no visas are
 valid, within next ten days this travel and tourism industry will come 
to a virtual stop.</p>
<p>It would mean that everyone will cut down costs and terminate non-essential staff and stop recruiting additional staff.</p>
<p>" Expressing similar views, Mudgill said,"In view of the staggering 
loss that the entire industry stares at, we request the government to 
consider review of the situation after 10 days and also consider giving 
relief in taxation to the sector as it will help in mitigating the 
losses suffered.</p>
<p>" Federation of Hotel &amp; Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) 
Vice President Gurbaxish Singh Kohli said,"Since November, when 
coronavirus made news, hotel room cancellations began and crossed the 80
 per cent mark.</p>
<p>New bookings are almost completely on hold, including the NRI segment
 which accounts for 60 per cent of the tourism revenues mostly in the 
months from April to September.</p>
<p>" Yatra.com Co-Founder and COO, Corporate Travel &amp; Head Industry 
Relations, Sabina Chopra said the latest suspension of visas from all 
countries to India is expected to have a substantial impact on the 
foreign tourist arrival in the country which was already witnessing a 
drop due to the prevailing situation.</p>
<p>"We have received close to 35 per cent cancellation queries from 
travellers planning their trip to foreign destinations," she said adding
 airfares to affected destinations have dropped by 40 per cent.</p>
<p>Chopra further said,"There has been about 18 per cent drop in hotel 
rates and we are receiving cancellation requests from various travellers
 who are wary of taking up trips domestically as well.</p>
<p>" According to industry chamber CII, this is the one of the worst 
crises ever to hit the Indian tourism industry impacting all its 
geographical segments - inbound, outbound and domestic, almost all 
tourism verticals - leisure , adventure, heritage, MICE, cruise, 
corporate and niche segments.</p>
<p>In an impact assessment of the coronavirus pandemic, CII Tourism 
Committee said to save on variable costs and minimise fixed costs many 
small and mid sized hotels, resorts and car rental companies are 
shutting down operations and asking staff to go on leave without pay.</p>
<p>Moreover, working capital of many corporates in tourism sector is 
seriously hit by almost 60 per cent and for micro, small and medium 
tourism enterprises by almost 80 per cent, it added.</p>
<p>"Most of the Indian tourism travel and hospitality companies are 
facing demands for full refunds and they are doing so out of their cash 
reserves even for which they have paid advance tax and GST," the CII 
assessment report added.</p>
<p>The report further said cancellations are "reaching a peak of almost 
80 per cent now in March in many Indian locations. The value at risk 
from this segment will be in multiples of tens of thousands of crores." 
With India cancelling all visas, the chamber said the impact "will be 
worse".</p>
<p>ANAROCK Property Consultants Chairman Anuj Puri said,"The 
cancellation of visas for foreigners as well as the strong advice issued
 to Indians to refrain from unnecessary travel will have a marked 
effect.</p>
<p>This is the most unsettling healthcare crisis in recent times and hotel bookings will go south.</p>
<p>" On Indians being advised to refrain from unnecessary travel, the 
CII report said,"The December holiday season of 2019 took an estimated 
hit of almost 40-50 per cent, the holiday season of April to July 2020 
is likely to take a humongous hit which could be as high as 80-100 per 
cent, unless there is positive news of the progression of virus 
decreasing.</p>
<p>VFS Global Regional Group COO - South Asia, Middle East and North 
Africa, Americas Vinay Malhotra said,"While it is too early to comment 
on the impact of coronavirus on visa application trends, so far, our 
visa application processes in India continue on schedule as per the 
mandates of our client governments." MakeMyTrip Group CEO Rajesh Magow 
said,"The decision by the government will have an impact on inbound and 
outbound international travel."</p>
