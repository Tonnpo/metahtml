<p>On December 25, 1991, twenty-five years ago today, the Soviet Union 
collapsed — four months after the collapse of a short-lived coup by the 
hardline communist “Gang of Eight,” and nearly 70 years after the 
Bolshevik Revolution. As a result of political purges, mass executions, 
and an intentional famine in the Ukraine in the 1930s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_Communist_regimes#Soviet_Union">millions of people perished</a> as a consequence of Russia’s experiment with communism.</p>
<p>Looking back at the media’s track record on communism, one sees a 
press that was too willing to act as a mouthpiece for the world’s worst 
dictatorships, and too accepting of the perverse claim that communism 
meant safety and security for its people.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most amazing piece of pro-Soviet propaganda produced in 
the 1980s was Ted Turner’s seven-hour Portrait of the Soviet Union, 
shown in the United States on the CNN founder’s TBS Superstation. Even 
the New York Times, in a March 20, 1988 review, deemed it an 
embarrassment, saying that the three-part series “is possessed by the 
same spirit that once led George Bernard Shaw to throw his dinner out 
the window of a Soviet train — because food was redundant amid socialist
 milk and honey.”</p>
<p>Narrator Roy Scheider (Jaws, The French Connection) read a script 
that would make the editors at Pravda blush: “The Soviet Union, draped 
in history, born in a bloody revolution, bound together by a dream that 
is still being dreamt. The dream of a socialist nation marching toward 
the world’s first communist state....Once the Kremlin was the home of 
czars. Today, it belongs to the people....Atheist though the state may 
be, freedom to worship as you believe is enshrined in the Soviet 
Constitution....Modernization on a grand scale. A great success.”</p>
<p> When Turner’s Portrait made it to the U.S.S.R. later that spring, 
Financial Times Moscow correspondent Quentin Peel reported that Soviet 
television “introduced [it] with the apology that the film gave an 
excessively glamorous portrait of the country.” Somehow, Turner managed 
to create a piece of propaganda that even its communist subjects 
couldn’t swallow.</p>
<p>While the rest of the media elite would not go as far as the 
sycophantic Turner, some reporters did push an embarrassingly 
pro-communist spin that would soon be undermined by events:</p>
<p>“If suddenly a true, two-party or multi-party system were to be 
formed in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party would still win in a 
real free election. Except for certain small pockets of resistance to 
the Communist regime, the people have been truly converted in the last 
68 years.”</p>
<p> — CNN Moscow bureau chief Stuart Loory in a letter to the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 3, 1986.</p>
<p> “Despite what many Americans think, most Soviets do not yearn for capitalism or Western-style democracy.”</p>
<p> — Anchor Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News, June 17, 1987.</p>
<p> “The reality is that even if the communist state were to protect 
individual rights aggressively, many of its people are not prepared to 
tolerate diversity.”</p>
<p> — Dan Rather on the May 27, 1988 CBS Evening News.</p>
<p> “Communism got to be a terrible word here in the United States, but 
our attitude toward it may have been unfair. Communism got in with a bad
 crowd when it was young and never had a fair chance....The Communist 
ideas of creating a society in which everyone does his best for the good
 of everyone is appealing and fundamentally a more uplifting idea than 
capitalism. Communism’s only real weakness seems to be that it doesn’t 
work.”</p>
<p> — 60 Minutes commentator Andy Rooney in the New York Times, June 26, 1989.</p>
<p> “Marx and Lenin are still revered heroes. Never mind that communism 
as they conceived it didn’t work. Most Soviets don’t want to dump it, 
just improve on it.”</p>
<p> — USA Today founder Al Neuharth, February 9, 1990 column.</p>
<p>Even before the official end, liberal reporters reacted to the sudden
 end of Soviet communism much as they had to the liberation of Eastern 
Europe, complaining of the “uncertainty” and “hardship” that the 
“painful shift” to capitalism and freedom would bring to the ex-Soviet 
states:</p>
<p> “Many Soviets viewing the current chaos and nationalist unrest under
 Gorbachev look back almost longingly to the era of brutal order under 
Stalin.”</p>
<p> — CBS’s Mike Wallace on 60 Minutes, February 11, 1990.</p>
<p> “Soviet people have become accustomed to security if nothing else. 
Life isn’t good here, but people don’t go hungry, homeless; a job has 
always been guaranteed. Now all socialist bets are off. A market economy
 looms, and the social contract that has held Soviet society together 
for 72 years no longer applies. The people seem baffled, disappointed, 
let down. Many don’t like the prospect of their nation becoming just 
another capitalist machine.”</p>
<p> — CNN Moscow reporter Steve Hurst on PrimeNews, May 24, 1990.</p>
<p>“Lines might be long, freedoms might be few, but one thing the state 
guaranteed was security from the cradle to the grave....But with the 
novel forces of democratization, decentralization, and freer expression 
came the hard truths of poverty, dislocation, crime, ethnic hatred and 
the erosion of the state’s omnipotence. Beggars and cripples emerged 
from the shadows, the injured and humiliated took to venting their 
grievances in the streets, and ever-worsening shortages pushed masses 
over the threshold of poverty.”</p>
<p> — New York Times reporter Serge Schmemann on the Soviet Union, March 13, 1991.</p>
<p> “Inefficient as the old communist economy was, it did provide jobs 
of a sort for everybody and a steady, if meager, supply of basic goods 
at low, subsidized prices; Soviet citizens for more than 70 years were 
conditioned to expect that from their government. Says a Moscow worker: 
‘We had everything during [Leonid] Brezhnev’s times. There was sausage 
in the stores. We could buy vodka. Things were normal.’”</p>
<p> — Time Associate Editor George J. Church, September 23, 1991.</p>
<p> “It’s short of soap, so there are lice in hospitals. It’s short of 
pantyhose, so women’s legs go bare. It’s short of snowsuits, so babies 
stay home in winter...The problem isn’t communism; nobody even talked 
about communism this week. The problem is shortages.”</p>
<p> — Commentator and ex-anchor John Chancellor on the August 21, 1991 NBC Nightly News.</p>
<p> “In the old Soviet Union, you never saw faces like these: the poor, 
the homeless, and the desperation of the Russian winter. Their numbers 
are growing. Tonight — is this what democracy does? A look at the Russia
 you haven’t seen before....The people of Russia are learning this 
winter that the price of freedom can be painfully high.”</p>
<p> — ABC’s Barbara Walters opening Nightline, January 14, 1992.</p>
<p> “But for the simple folk of Uzbekistan, people like Kurban 
Manizayov, these are mind-wrenching times. Their simple wants were 
nicely cared for by the communists. But now they’ve been thrust into the
 hurly-burly world of market capitalism, and nobody even bothered to ask
 if it was all right.”</p>
<p> — CNN Moscow reporter Steve Hurst, August 31, 1992 World News.</p>
<p> “Many here long for the days of Brezhnev. At least then, they say, they had their dignity.”</p>
<p> — CBS reporter Tom Fenton, September 24, 1993 Evening News.</p>
<p> “For more than 70 years, Russia dreamed the Soviet dream: the dream 
of a classless society, the dream of a workers’ paradise. The classless 
state is now a state with a growing population of haves and an exploding
 population of have-nots. For many, the workers’ paradise has become a 
homeless hell.”</p>
<p> — ABC’s Morton Dean, January 14, 1994 Good Morning America.</p>
<p>In her 2003 book Useful Idiots, conservative writer Mona Charen 
described the communist state as a “comprehensive tyranny,” adding:</p>
<p>The Soviet Union was not so much a state as a vast criminal 
conspiracy. Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn, Vladimir Bukovsky, Natan Sharansky, 
and others are the great chroniclers of the grotesque inhumanity of the 
Gulag and Communist rule....[The record shows] mass murders, 
deportations, political persecutions, abuse of psychiatry, and other 
depredations committed by the Communists.</p>
<p>In spite of communism’s appalling human rights record, journalists 
perversely suggested that the repressive totalitarian system was somehow
 superior — better for women’s “rights,” for example, or better than the
 “conservative” Catholic Church.</p>
<p> “Yes, somehow, Soviet citizens are freer these days — freer to kill 
one another, freer to hate Jews....Doing away with totalitarianism and 
adding a dash of democracy seems an unlikely cure for all that ails the 
Soviet system.”</p>
<p> — Co-host Harry Smith on CBS This Morning, February 9, 1990.</p>
<p> “There is a danger that the forces of democracy, as they are called,
 will now go too far. There is a spirit of revenge in the air [after the
 failed Soviet coup].”</p>
<p> — Former New York Times reporter Hedrick Smith, August 26, 1991 Good Morning America.</p>
<p> “The economic and political turmoil that has swept the former 
Communist East Bloc has hit women the hardest. There’s been a strong 
backlash against the idea of women’s equality....Under the Communists, 
women in the workplace were glorified. And if they needed time off to 
give birth and raise families, they got it at full pay.”</p>
<p> — ABC reporter Jerry King, April 6, 1992 World News Tonight.</p>
<p>Ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, reporters marked the 
anniversary by focusing on how much worse life had become for those 
freed from communism. CNN’s Christiane Amanpour actually scolded Mikhail
 Gorbechev in a November 8, 1999 interview. “Ten years later, many are 
saying the unbridled capitalism that followed communism has unleashed 
misery on citizens who had all their social needs taken care of, 
especially in the former Soviet Union,” Amanpour asserted.</p>
<p>She lectured Gorbachev: “Mr. President, you are regarded by many 
people in this world as a hero for causing the end of tyranny and the 
collapse of communism. But you are also criticized heavily by those who 
say you opened a Pandora’s Box. And they say, ‘Look at the strife now, 
look at the economic chaos, look at the Mafia structure, look at the 
corruption.’ They say that you opened and started a plan that you did 
not know how to finish.”</p>
<p>The next night on ABC’s World News Tonight, anchor Peter Jennings 
struck the same note: “It is probably hard for most Americans to imagine
 anyone feeling nostalgic about living behind the Wall. It may also be 
hard to imagine that anyone in the Western part of Germany would miss 
the Wall either. But miss it, some people do.”</p>
<p>Five years later, Moscow was one of the stops for NBC’s Matt Lauer 
during his annual “Where in the World Is Matt Lauer?” Today show 
feature. Lauer suggested that, for many Russians, the decades spent 
under communism were the good old days: “We’re gonna be talking about 
the New Russia, how a few people are doing very well and the fear that 
others are being left very far behind,” he teased on the February 12, 
2004 morning news program. He later declared: “Russia’s rush to 
capitalism left the vast majority scrambling to survive. For many, life 
is worse than it was in Soviet times.”</p>
<p>In the October 12, 2009, Newsweek wondered: “Was Russia Better Off 
Red?” The magazine answered its own question with a full-page graphic 
showing that Russia today has fewer hospitals and movie theaters, but 
more crime and divorce. “Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991,
 Russia has seen an increase in oligarchs and Louis Vuitton outlets. But
 by many other measures, Russians are worse off.”</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union existed, the embarrassing puff pieces sat 
alongside reports of military crackdowns, belligerent speeches from the 
Kremlin wall, and occasional reports on dissidents and other abuses. But
 with the Soviet Union gone, the gauzy nostalgia took on an increasing 
share of what the media continued to say about communism.</p>
<p>The pop culture also contributed to the softening of communism’s 
image. As the Boston Globe’s Jeff Jacoby noted in a 2006 column, “The 
glamorization of communism is widespread. On West 4th Street in 
Manhattan, the popular KGB Bar is known for its literary readings and 
Soviet propaganda posters. In Los Angeles, the La La Ling boutique sells
 baby clothing emblazoned with the face of Che Guevara, Fidel Castro’s 
notorious henchman. At the House of Mao, a popular eatery in Singapore, 
waiters in Chinese army uniforms serve Long March Chicken, and a giant 
picture of Mao Zedong dominates one wall.”</p>
<p>Many reporters seem disturbingly sympathetic to the idea that state 
control is preferable to a free economy. In the mid-1990s, researchers 
Stanley Rothman and Amy Black surveyed journalists and found strong 
support for government intervention, including making sure that everyone
 has a job and working to “reduce the income gap between the rich and 
the poor.” Writing in the Spring 2001 issue of Public Interest, Rothman 
and Black concluded: “Despite the discrediting of centrally planned 
economies produced by the collapse of the Soviet Union and other 
communist regimes, attitudes about government control of the economy 
have not changed much since the 1980s.”</p>
<p>The too-fond reminiscences of Soviet communism are at odds with the 
realities of history. As an economic model, communism was an utter 
failure. Over the decades the two existed side by side, citizens in the 
capitalist world enjoyed increasing standards of living, technological 
innovation, and growing wealth, while the communist world stagnated or 
worse. But as a political system, totalitarian communism was a true 
horror, with casualties numbering in the tens of millions. There is 
nothing in the true record of communism that merits romantic reflection.</p>
