        </head><body><article><p>After spending much of the past year 
suppressing information related to the Wuhan lab leak, it has now 
emerged that Google funded virus research carried out by Wuhan-linked 
scientist Peter Daszak.</p>
<p>Yes, really.</p>
<p>Until recently, those who dared voice their contention that the virus
 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology found themselves being 
censored and in some cases banned by Google-owned YouTube.</p>
<p>Now we realize why.</p>
<p>Google had been funding the Wuhan lab-linked organization led by Daszak – EcoHealth Alliance – for over a decade.</p>
<p>“The tech giant’s charity arm, Google.org, has repeatedly provided 
financial backing for research and studies carried out by scandal-hit 
Daszak and his New York-based EcoHealth Alliance,” reports the Daily 
Mail.</p>
<p>“The financial ties, which were first reported by The National Pulse,
 are disclosed in various scientific studies dating back to at least 
2010.”</p>
<p>A 2010 study on bat flaviviruses that lists Daszak as a co-author credits Google.org for an unspecified amount of funding.</p>
<p>That study was also funded by the National Institutes of Health and 
the United States Agency for International Development’s emerging 
pandemic threat program.</p>
<p>Similarly, a 2015 paper on herpes lists Daszak and also credits Google.org for its support.</p>
<p>More recently, EcoHealth Alliance researchers authored a report on a 
2018 study that looked at ‘perceptions associated with transmission of 
pathogens with pandemic potential in highly exposed human populations at
 the animal-human interface’.</p>
<p>The report noted it was ‘made possible’ by Google.org’s funding.</p>
<p>According to political advisor Steve Hilton, the story represents “one of the biggest scandals for…a hundred years.”</p>
<p>Daszak had previously <a href="https://summit.news/2021/06/02/email-researcher-who-funded-wuhan-lab-admitted-to-manipulating-coronaviruses-thanked-fauci-for-dismissing-lab-leak-theory/">sent an email</a> to Dr. Anthony Fauci at the start of the pandemic thanking him for dismissing claims that the virus had escaped from the lab.</p>
<p>Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance group had long term extensive financial ties to gain of function research carried out at the lab.</p>
<p>Despite this, the scientist was later appointed to lead a WHO 
investigation into the lab which lasted for just 3 hours before Daszak’s
 team poured cold water on the lab leak hypothesis.</p>
<p>Dr. Daszak was also appointed as a COVID-19 fact-checker by Facebook,
 further empowering him to censor information and blacklist those who 
spoke out about the lab leak theory.</p>
<p>So in other words, major social media networks conspired to bury the 
issue while dishonestly claiming they were countering ‘medical 
misinformation’.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://summit.news/2021/06/22/finally-daszak-is-fired-from-commission-investigating-covid-origins/">highlighted</a>
 earlier, despite Daszak’s glaring conflict of interest, he was also 
tapped to head up the Lancet’s UN backed commission to investigate the 
origins of the coronavirus, although he has now been dismissed from that
 role.</p>
