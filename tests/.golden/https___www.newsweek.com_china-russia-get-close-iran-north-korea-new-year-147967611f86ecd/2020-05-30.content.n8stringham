<h1 class="rm-manual">China, Russia Forge Closer Ties on North Korea, Iran As U.S. Policy Brings Uncertainty to New Year</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> By <span> <span> <a href="file:///authors/tom-oconnor" rel="author"> <span>Tom O'Connor</span></a> </span> </span> On 12/30/19 at 12:31 PM EST </p>

<p>China and Russia have <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/russia-china-no-alliance-powerful-partnership-1478556">accelerated their coordination</a>
 on international issues involving Iran and North Korea in the final 
weeks of this year as the United States' own hard-line approaches were 
met with increasing difficulties.</p>
<p>Threats of an undesirable "Christmas gift" teased by North Korea 
never came to fruition as the U.S. allowed the holiday to pass with no 
new plan to move forward with their denuclearization-for-peace process, 
but China and Russia have sought to avoid a new crisis in the region by 
going their own route. The two powers <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/us-north-korea-deal-china-russia-team-1477822">introduced a United Nations Security Council draft resolution</a> that would give supreme leader Kim Jong Un something he wanted: partial sanctions relief.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told a press 
briefing Monday in Beijing that the two countries' efforts were meant 
"to maintain peace and stability on the Peninsula, stick to dialogue and
 consultation to resolve disputes, and advance the establishment of a 
permanent peace regime and complete denuclearization on the Peninsula in
 parallel."</p>
<p>"Our proposal to adjust some of the sanctions on the DPRK is to meet 
the reasonable humanitarian and livelihood needs of the DPRK people in 
support of the process of political dialogue," Geng said, using an 
acronym for the official name of North Korea.</p>
<p>"China and Russia are now in contact with other Security Council 
members and relevant parties of the Peninsula issue on the content of 
the draft resolution," he added. "We expect members of the Security 
Council to shoulder their responsibility and take active moves to 
support political settlement, encourage talks and safeguard peace and 
stability on the Peninsula."</p>

powers have been coordinating on international affairs more closely than
 ever, a worrying trend for the U.S. as it tries to assert its own 
interests.</span> <span>FLORENCE LO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption><p>France,
 the United Kingdom and the U.S., however, have argued that the lifting 
of international sanctions targeting North Korea should first require 
the elusive, militarized state to shutter its nuclear weapons program. 
China and Russia's joint proposal would need to not be vetoed by these 
three fellow permanent U.N. Security Council members and receive nine 
votes of approval in all.</p>
<p>Beijing and Moscow have so far backed President Donald Trump's 
historic efforts to make peace with Kim but have tried to encourage him 
to be more forthcoming with suspending economic restrictions and joint 
U.S.-South Korean military exercises viewed as provocative by North 
Korea. The White House, however, has largely stuck to its "maximum 
pressure" strategy, an approach that also came at odds with Russia and 
China's stance toward another longtime U.S. adversary, Iran.</p>

<p>Both countries joined the U.S., as well as the European Union, 
France, Germany and the U.K. to sign the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, 
but Trump left the deal last year unilaterally imposing its own 
sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Since then, Washington and Tehran 
have blamed one another for destabilizing the Persian Gulf region and 
potentially threatening the flow of international oil. Here too, Geng 
told reporters Monday that "China and Russia have been in close 
communication and coordination."</p>
<p>Geng said Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif recently 
spoke by telephone with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and was set to 
visit Beijing on Tuesday. First, however, Zarif traveled to the Russian 
capital and discussed the Iranian nuclear deal with his Russian Foreign 
Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow, whose top diplomat "spoke about the 
serious efforts that we are making to maintain this important 
international agreement that the United States is trying to undermine as
 a result of the destructive line that Washington continues."</p>
<p>"We discussed the situation in the Persian Gulf," Lavrov added, 
touting both Russian and Iranian initiatives to create an international 
coalition rivaling a U.S.-led maritime unit currently patrolling the 
restive Persian Gulf. "Russia and Iran advocate pooling the efforts of 
all interested states to ensure security and stability in this region."</p>

attacks by U.S. planes on several bases belonging to the Iran-backed 
Kataib Hezbollah, or Hezbollah Brigades, near Al-Qaim, an Iraqi district
 bordering Syria. The strikes, which killed up to 25 fighters, were met 
with outrage by Baghdad, a close partner of both Washington and Tehran. </span> <span>HUSSEIN FALEH/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption><p>Unrest
 in this energy-critical region has only worsened, however, as 
Washington blamed Tehran for attacks on tanker vessels, Saudi oil 
facilities and military installations associated with U.S. military 
presence in Iraq. In an unprecedented move, the Pentagon conducted what 
it called "defensive strikes" Sunday against Iraqi militia Kataib 
Hezbollah, a close partner of Iran, in Iraq and Syria after <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/rocket-attack-iraq-kills-us-citizen-1479430">a rocket attack</a> killed one Pentagon contractor and injured several U.S. and Iraqi personnel Thursday in northern Iraq.</p>

<p>Iranian officials, including President Hassan Rouhani, strongly 
denied having ordered the attack on U.S. personnel and condemned the 
U.S. operation. Even top officials in Baghdad, a close partner of 
Washington and Tehran, criticized the U.S. move as a violation of Iraqi 
sovereignty.</p>
<p>In a statement published Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it
 "took with serious concern the exchange of attacks" between the U.S. 
and Iraq militias and that it found "such actions unacceptable and 
counterproductive." During his press conference that same day, Geng said
 that "China has always opposed the use of force in international 
relations and advocates that all parties should abide by the purposes 
and principles of the U.N. Charter and the basic principles of 
international relations."</p>
<p>The latest escalations came after Russian, Chinese and Iranian forces launched their <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/iran-warns-us-middle-east-dominance-over-naval-drills-russia-china-1479628">first-ever joint naval exercises</a>
 in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman, further sign of Beijing and 
Moscow's willingness to counter Washington's efforts to isolate Tehran 
internationally.</p>
