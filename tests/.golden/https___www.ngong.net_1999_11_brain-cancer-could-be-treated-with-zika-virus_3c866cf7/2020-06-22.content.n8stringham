<p class="rm-manual">November 29, 1999 by <a href="file:///go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzE5MjcyLnBocA==">www.medicalnewstoday.com</a> </p>
<p>A new study looks into the potential of the Zika virus to target and 
kill brain cancer cells. The results, so far, are encouraging, but 
researchers suggest that there is a long way to go until a safe and 
effective treatment is reached. Could the Zika virus be used for health?
 A new study suggests that it could, despite – or rather, because of – 
its tendency to target and destroy neural progenitor cells, which are 
brain stem cells that differentiate into neurons and glial cells in the 
central nervous system. This is why the babies of mothers infected with 
Zika during their pregnancy are often born with microcephaly. However, 
this might also make the Zika virus a viable “weapon” against 
glioblastoma stem cells, which are undifferentiated cells that promote 
the development of glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive form of brain
 cancer. The research was co-directed by Drs. Michael Diamond and Milan 
Chheda, both from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis,
 MO, alongside Dr. Jeremy Rich, from the University of California School
 of Medicine in San Diego. “We knew that [the] Zika virus selectively 
targeted neuroprogenitor or stem cells in the brain in developing 
fetuses. A postdoctoral fellow, Zhe… <a href="file:///go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzE5MjcyLnBocA==" rel="nofollow">Read full this story</a></p>
