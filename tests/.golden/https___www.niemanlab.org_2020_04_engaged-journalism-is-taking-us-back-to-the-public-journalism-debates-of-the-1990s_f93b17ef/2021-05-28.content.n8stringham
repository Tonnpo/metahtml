<p>Editor’s note: Longtime Nieman Lab readers know the bylines of <a href="https://twitter.com/markcoddington">Mark Coddington</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SethCLewis">Seth Lewis</a>. Mark <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/author/mcoddington/">wrote the weekly This Week in Review column</a> for us from 2010 to 2014; <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/author/slewis/">Seth’s written for us</a>
 off and on since 2010. Both are working journalists who then became 
journalism academics, and I’ve always appreciated the emphasis they put 
on connecting conceptual work with the lives of actual journalists.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, they debuted a new monthly newsletter called <a href="https://rq1.substack.com/">RQ1</a>
 — academic-speak for Research Question 1, the first vertebra in a 
research paper’s spine. Each issue includes a brief essay on some 
subject being discussed recently in the literature and a roundup of 
other interesting research from the past month. They’ve agreed to let us
 bring it to you here on Nieman Lab. So you should definitely <a href="https://rq1.substack.com/">go sign up for RQ1</a> to get it in your inbox — but you’ll also be able to see each edition here.</p>
<p>Welcome to the third edition of RQ1. For those who are new, we are <a href="http://markcoddington.com/">Mark Coddington</a> and <a href="http://sethlewis.org/">Seth Lewis</a>
 — two former journalists turned academics, now teaching and researching
 at Washington and Lee University (Mark) and the University of Oregon 
(Seth).</p>
<p>In trying to keep pace with all the new research about news and 
journalism, we hope to give you each month a quick breakdown of a 
notable piece of new research, and also to highlight some other 
interesting work you might want to check out. We can’t cover it all, of 
course, so consider this a good-faith sampling of some of the most 
interesting findings in news research. If you have ideas or suggestions,
 please shoot us a reply — we’d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>Here’s what we found in this month’s news research.</p>
<h3>A persistent pursuit to reform U.S. journalism</h3>
<p>For decades, critics have argued that journalists and news 
organizations (particularly in the U.S.) are too disconnected from their
 audiences. Journalists, these critics have said, struggle to fully 
appreciate people’s concerns, dismiss opportunities to involve them in 
news-making, and altogether fail to develop a more <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17512786.2013.859840">mutually beneficial relationship</a>
 with the communities that journalism is expected to serve in the first 
place. In recent years, this critique and its push to reform journalism 
has taken the form of “<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/12/engaged-journalism-its-finally-happening/">engaged journalism</a>,”
 which, broadly speaking, suggests that public trust in news will 
improve as the public has a more active, rather than passive, part to 
play in the news agenda. But where did this concept of engaged 
journalism come from, and why does it sound so familiar to the similarly
 styled <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ncr.58">“public journalism” movement</a> that emerged in the 1990s but failed to take hold in American journalism?</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/11955">new (open-access) paper in the </a><a href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/11955">International Journal of Communication</a>
 offers some answers. To better understand how the journalism community 
has explained (to itself) the need first for public journalism and later
 for engaged journalism — as well as how journalists have come to 
envision their audiences through both reform movements — the authors 
conducted a close reading of dozens of trade-press articles published 
during the public journalism period (1992-2001) and the rise of engaged 
journalism (2005-2018).</p>
<p>In their analysis, <a href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/11955">Patrick Ferrucci, Jacob L. Nelson, and Miles P. Davis identify three key themes</a>
 about the apparent need for public journalism and engaged journalism, 
as championed by their advocates in trade magazines: “First, journalism 
is in trouble and needs fixing; second, there is a need to remodel how 
journalists think and act; and third, the industry needs a market-driven
 or nakedly capitalistic approach due to an economic downturn.”</p>
<p>Then, looking at how the public journalism and engaged journalism 
movements imagine the news audience, they point to three assumptions 
that are consistent in the trade-press discourse of both time periods: 
“First, the audience includes marginalized populations who want to 
contribute to the news production process, yet are traditionally not 
allowed to do so. Second, the audience knows more about its needs than 
journalists do. And third, the audience is disdainful of journalists’ 
elitist approach to their work.”</p>
<p>There’s a striking similarity between the diagnoses of and 
prescriptions for what ails journalism in both cases: namely, allow 
audiences to participate because they want to as civically minded people
 who can help improve news quality in the process, and because doing so 
may help the bottom line at the same time — a win-win. This belief has 
“an obvious, intuitive appeal,” the authors write, “because it suggests 
that the news industry has a great deal of autonomy when it comes to 
solving its profession’s most pressing problems.”</p>
<p>Overall, the consistent ethos of these reform efforts indicates that 
even if public journalism failed in its 1990s form, its spirit lives on 
in engaged journalism today. And it suggests that the debate about the 
role of the audience in news — a debate at least as old as the “<a href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/343">Lippmann-Dewey Debate</a>”
 more than a century ago — will persist for some time, even if it’s 
unlikely to be resolved anytime soon or, perhaps, lead to the kind of 
significant change in the way news is produced that reformers hope.</p>
<p>Even more, the authors wonder, reformers’ focus on the audience 
relationship and their assumption that journalists can fix things on 
their own may be misleading, particularly at a time when larger 
structural forces — such as the economics of digital advertising and the
 power of platform companies — may pose more existential problems for 
the future of journalism.</p>
<h3>Research roundup</h3>
<p>Here are some other studies that caught our eye this past month.</p>
<p> <span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/70/1/114/5761879">Gender differences in political media coverage: A meta-analysis</a>. By Daphne Joanna Van der Pas and Loes Aaldering, in Journal of Communication.</span></p>
<p>It might seem self-evident that political news coverage is unfair to 
female politicians, but research in this area has been divided, with 
some scholars concluding that women receive less attention than their 
male counterparts and others arguing that we’ve moved toward gender 
parity in political news. Van der Pas and Aaldering analyze a massive 
amount of data (90 quantitative studies covering 750,000 media stories 
over decades) and find that women in politics do indeed get less media 
attention than men — 17 percentage points less on the whole. The 
numerous secondary factors they examine are fascinating: In one 
particularly surprising finding, the gender bias in amount of coverage 
virtually disappears in majoritarian political systems where politics is
 more personal than party-oriented.</p>
<p> <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1464884920913436">The culture of free: Construct explication and democratic ramifications for readers’ willingness to pay for public affairs news</a>. By Manuel Goyanes, Marton Demeter, and Laura de Grado, in Journalism.</span></p>
<p>Goyanes and his colleagues pose a question that has vexed most of the
 world’s newsrooms over the past decade — Why won’t more people pay for 
news? — by interviewing several dozen digital news consumers in Spain. 
Their answer is encompassed in a concept they call “the culture of 
free,” which has four characteristics: A belief that news is a public 
good that should be free, habits of consuming news for free, freely 
available competition among news sources, and a notion of news 
consumption as a sort of mindless free-time filler. A key aspect of the 
study’s argument is that these news non-payers don’t believe the news 
they consume is low-quality; they just believe it must be available for 
free. That view has been encouraged by the homogenization and 
commodification of news in recent years, the authors argue.</p>
<p> <span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21670811.2020.1738254">Protecting news companies and their readers: Exploring social media policies in Latin American newsrooms</a>. By Summer Harlow, in Digital Journalism.</span></p>
<p>As journalists move into their second decade of widespread 
professional social media use, guidelines from their employers continue 
to be one of the main places where the tensions over what that use 
should look like play out. In a survey of journalists across 20 Latin 
American countries, Harlow finds that most Latin American journalists 
don’t have social media guidelines in their newsrooms, suggesting that 
social media still isn’t very institutionalized in many of those 
countries. As journalists understand them, those policies are focused on
 what not to do, as a way to protect professional norms and the news 
organization’s image. This defensive mindset does extend to emphasizing 
respect for readers and sources, but not to protecting journalists 
themselves from harassment.</p>
<p> <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1940161220907018">Populist attitudes and selective exposure to online news: A cross-country analysis combining web tracking and surveys</a>. By Sebastian Stier, Nora Kirkizh, Caterina Froio, and Ralph Schroeder, in The International Journal of Press/Politics.</span></p>
<p>Stier and his colleagues address a longstanding issue of interest to 
researchers — where partisans, in this case populists, get their news — 
through a remarkably comprehensive method. They collect web tracking 
data from more than 7,000 people across Europe and the U.S. and tie it 
to survey data from the same people, so they can make precise 
connections between their political attitudes and their actual news 
consumption habits. It turns out populists do indeed consume less legacy
 news media than others, but they still consume a lot more legacy news 
than they do hyperpartisan news. The results also vary widely by 
country: Populists only consume more hyperpartisan news in countries 
(like the U.S. and Germany) where the hyperpartisan news ecosystem is 
very strong and where such attitudes aren’t found in legacy media (as 
they are in the U.K. tabloids).</p>
<p> <span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21670811.2020.1736946">Computational news discovery: Towards design considerations for editorial orientation algorithms in journalism</a>. By Nicholas Diakopoulos, in Digital Journalism.</span></p>
<p>Through interviews with journalists, Diakopoulos goes deep into how 
newsrooms use what he calls “computational news discovery”: tools that 
use algorithms to flag potentially newsworthy events or information. He 
finds that despite the algorithmic intervention, the process of turning 
those leads into news is still a deeply human and variable one. The 
tools are still subject to the immense demands on journalists’ 
attention, at some times helping direct that attention but at others 
merely diverting it. The tools also highlight the extreme complexity 
and, as Diakopoulos calls it, “configurability” of newsworthiness, as 
journalists’ sense of what is actually newsworthy depends heavily on 
idiosyncratic factors and organizational influences.</p>
<p> <span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2020.1713267">Sorting the news: How ranking by popularity polarizes our politics</a>. By Yotam Shmargad and Samara Klar, in Political Communication.</span></p>
<p>Shmargad and Klar are interested in the role that algorithmic 
rankings based on social inputs (like the ones on Facebook and Reddit) 
have in users’ news attitudes toward the news they’re consuming — 
specifically, whether those rankings have a politically polarizing 
effect. They use an experiment to build rankings based on popularity 
among Republicans and Democrats, and find that when users are given 
rankings based on cues from a un-like-minded network (e.g., 
conservatives with a liberal-ranked list), they actually express support
 for some articles that oppose their own views. But the good news ends 
there: Those participants show less political engagement and more 
frustration with media representativeness as a result, and the 
participants who get algorithms that support their own views find their 
partisan reactions to news heightened.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23736992.2020.1736079">Electoral reckonings: Press criticism of presidential campaign coverage, 2000-2016.</a> By Elizabeth Bent, Kimberly Kelling, and Ryan J. Thomas, in Journal of Media Ethics.</span></p>
<p>One of the longstanding routines of U.S. presidential campaign 
coverage is the news media’s criticism of its own coverage, especially 
as critics grapple with the election’s results after the fact. This trio
 of University of Missouri researchers examine this press criticism over
 the last five election cycles to find trends in the coverage itself. 
They find that many of the critiques circle around a few recurring 
themes, most prominently a failure to exercise independent judgment, 
especially as it relates to use and misuse of polling data. They also 
found repeated criticism of the news media’s failure to properly 
represent the electorate, whether “values voters” in 2004, a more 
diverse voting base in 2008, or white working-class voters in 2016. 
Notably, they see a dramatic shift in the tone of criticism in 2016, as 
the change called for went from incremental to an overhaul, and the 
rhetoric around the role of technology turned negative for the first 
time.</p>
