<p class="">The number of reported <a href="https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/03/new-jersey-announces-78-new-coronavirus-cases-statewide-total-jumps-to-at-least-176-positive-tests.html">coronavirus cases</a> shot up drastically Monday in New Jersey, when the state announced 80 new cases, bringing the total to at least 178.</p>
<p>The first reported case was on March 5, when a 32-year-old man from 
Fort Lee, Bergen County, tested positive. Since then, the state has seen
 exponential growth. In the U.S., there are thousands of confirmed cases
 and nearly 70 deaths, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.
 Across the world, more than 175,000 people have been reported to be 
infected in the pandemic. More than 7,000 have died, according to <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">Johns Hopkins University</a>.</p>
<p>So far, New Jersey has recorded three deaths. Rita Fusco-Jackson, a Freehold resident in her 50s died on Thursday, officials <a href="https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/03/nj-confirms-2nd-coronavirus-death-monmouth-county-woman-in-her-50s.html">said this weekend</a>. The first death was of John Brennan, a 69-year-old man from Bergen county, who died March 10.</p>
<p>On Monday night, Gov. Phil Murphy announced the death of a man in his 90s from the virus.</p>
<p>The trajectory for coronavirus cases in New Jersey closely mirrors 
what has been seen elsewhere in the U.S. and around the world: a slow 
buildup followed by dramatic spikes that reflect the virus’ exponential 
spread. The number of cases announced on Monday — 80 — raised the state 
total to 178, an 82% growth in reported cases overnight.</p>
<p>As recently as 11 days ago, there was one case in one county in New 
Jersey. Now, 14 counties are affected. Hunterdon County had its first 
positive test on Monday, the first new county to be affected since 
Mercer and Ocean three days ago. The spread has been swift in Essex 
County. The virus was found in eight other counties prior to being seen 
for the first time there on Thursday, but Essex now has the second most 
cases in the state behind Bergen.</p>
<p>As of March 15, there were no reported cases in Cape May, Cumberland, Atlantic, Salem, Gloucester, Sussex or Warren counties.</p>
<p>On a radio show Sunday, Murphy said he’d take <a href="https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/03/nj-declares-state-of-emergency-over-coronavirus-concerns.html">“more draconian steps” </a>to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Murphy asked for a statewide curfew Monday, requesting New Jerseyans 
to not leave their homes between 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. to help stop the 
spread of the virus. He announced it after a joint call with New York 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont. The governors of the 
tristate area also jointly announced all <a href="https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/03/nj-shuttering-casinos-movie-theaters-and-gyms-because-of-coronavirus.html">movie theaters, gyms, and casinos in all three states must close at 8 p.m. Monday </a>and
 will remain closed until further instruction. They also said that bars 
and restaurants will only serve take-out food till further notice.</p>
<p>“We want everybody home — not out,” Murphy said.</p>
