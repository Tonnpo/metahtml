<h2 class="rm-manual">North Korea Sends Mixed Messages on Possibility of Talks with US</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">Voice of America</p>

<p> SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - North Korea on Tuesday downplayed the 
possibility of talks with the United States, several days after its 
leader Kim Jong Un hinted at the possibility of dialogue.</p>
<p>Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of the North Korean leader, said 
in a statement that the United States appears to have the "wrong" 
expectation about her brother's recent comments.</p>
<p>"It seems that the U.S. may interpret the situation in such a way as 
to seek comfort for itself. The expectation, which they chose to harbour
 the wrong way, would plunge them into a greater disappointment," she 
said in the statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News 
Agency.</p>
<p>At a ruling party meeting last week in Pyongyang, Kim Jong Un said 
his country must be prepared for both "dialogue and confrontation."</p>
<p>White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday told 
the ABC television network news program This Week that Kim's comments 
were an "interesting signal" but that he wanted clearer signs from 
Pyongyang. He also reiterated that Washington wants to resume direct 
negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program.</p>
<p>The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden completed its North 
Korea policy review last month, saying it was open to talks but 
insistent that North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>During a visit this week to Seoul, Sung Kim, the U.S. envoy for North
 Korea, said he hopes North Korea will positively respond to meet 
"anytime, anywhere without preconditions."</p>
<p>The U.S. envoy is meeting this week with his South Korean and 
Japanese counterparts, to portray a unified stance on the North Korean 
issue.</p>
<p>Despite the flurry of diplomatic activity, Kim Yo Jong's statement 
suggests there has been little progress on resuming talks, some analysts
 say.</p>
<p>"We've been waiting for follow up signals from Pyongyang after Kim 
Jong Un's recent remarks to help clarify his meaning. Kim Yo Jong's 
statement starts to do that. While she doesn't fully shut out the idea 
that diplomacy can resume, she appears to suggest it's not likely for 
now," said Jenny Town, a Korea specialist at the Washington-based 
Stimson Center.</p>

leader Kim Jong Un (L) and US President Donald Trump shake hands during a
 meeting on the south side of the Military Demarcation Line that divides
 North and South Korea.</p>
<p>North Korea has boycotted talks with the United States since 2019. At
 a summit with Kim Jong Un in February of that year, former U.S. 
President Donald Trump rejected an offer in which Pyongyang would 
dismantle a key nuclear complex in exchange for Washington lifting most 
sanctions.</p>
<p>Since then, the coronavirus pandemic has upended the equation. North 
Korea went into a severe lockdown in January 2020, cutting off almost 
all contact with the outside world and even restraining trade with its 
economic lifeline, China.</p>
<p>"Paranoid about the pandemic, North Korea has severely limited 
outside contact for a year and a half. It has been eking out national 
'self-reliance' with discreet support from China, but border closures 
have caused much economic disruption," pointed out Leif-Eric Easley, a 
professor at Ewha University in Seoul.</p>
<p>At a meeting with senior leaders, Kim Jong Un last week formally acknowledged his country is facing a "tense" food situation.</p>
<p>Several foreign media reports, quoting sources inside North Korea, 
suggest massive price spikes and increasing food shortages. However, 
confirmation of such stories is difficult since most foreigners, 
including aid workers and diplomats, have left the country during the 
pandemic.</p>
<p>"Kim feels the need to address domestic suffering by convening 
high-profile government meetings more frequently than his father and 
grandfather. These meetings are largely political theater to cover up 
failures of economic planning and oppressive social control," Easley 
said.</p>
<p>North Korea insists to the outside world that it has found no 
coronavirus cases within its borders - an almost impossible assertion 
that has been widely disputed by experts. A major outbreak could be 
devastating for North Korea, an impoverished country that lacks adequate
 health infrastructure and medical supplies.</p>
