<p>JAKARTA, Indonesia: Some Indonesian residents are traveling to wealthier countries to receive Covid vaccinations.</p>
<p>"It just so happens that I haven't gotten the vaccine here, so I 
might as well go for a trip and get a vaccine there," 25 year-old 
Muhammad Risqy from Indonesia said, as reported by Reuters.</p>
<p>Risqy will travel with his parents, and all three will be vaccinated in America.</p>
<p>To date, Indonesia has only fully vaccinated 5 percent, or 8.8 
million people, according to the government. Authorities had set a goal 
of vaccinating 181.5 million Indonesians in 2021.</p>
<p>Officials of ATS Vacations, an Indonesian travel agency offering 
"vaccination tours", said it earlier lost 75 percent of its business due
 to the pandemic. Company officials add that vaccination trips are 
beneficial to both the travel industry and consumers.</p>
<p>"We are helping those who want to get vaccinated, but are having 
difficulties (getting a shot). Since they want to travel at the same 
time, why not combine both?" asked Lilik Budiman, ATS Vacations' sales 
director, as reported by Reuters.</p>
<p>The agency's advertising promotes "the chance for a free vaccine."</p>
<p>More than 100 people have booked vaccination tours, scheduled to be 
held from June to November. However, those seeking to travel need to 
secure visas to their destination countries.</p>
<p>The eight-day group tours for vaccinations can cost from $1,100 per 
person. Individual tours can cost as much as $3,700 per person.</p>
<p>Another Indonesian, Dewiana, 33, has scheduled a vaccination tour 
with her husband at the end of September. She said she was motivated by 
the opportunity to receive her preferred vaccine brand.</p>
<p>"From the brochure, I learned that the vaccine we will get is Johnson &amp; Johnson," she told Reuters.</p>
<p>Indonesia has been vaccinating its population with China's Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines.</p>
<p>"Seeking medical treatment in the United States is a permissible 
purpose of travel for individuals holding a valid visitor visa," said 
Michael Quinlan, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia, as 
quoted by Reuters.</p>
