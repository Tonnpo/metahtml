<p class="rm-manual">The Trump administration is proposing an $850 
billion stimulus package to help struggling businesses and individuals 
weather the economic slowdown triggered by the coronavirus.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: </p>
<p> President Trump's administration is proposing an $850 billion 
stimulus package to help businesses and individuals cope with the abrupt
 slowdown in the U.S. economy from the coronavirus and the related 
shutdowns. Eight-hundred-fifty billion dollars - that's the scale of 
bailouts during the financial crisis more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>NPR's Scott Horsley covered that crisis, is here for this crisis. Scott, good morning.</p>
<p>SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.</p>
<p>INSKEEP: Sounds like the White House agrees that the economy needs a lot of help.</p>
<p>HORSLEY: It seems so. The Federal Reserve did its part over the 
weekend, slashing interest rates to zero, pumping hundreds of billions 
of dollars into the banking system to keep credit flowing. But even as 
the central bank took that action, Chairman Jerome Powell said there was
 a need for Congress and the administration to do more.</p>
<p>As late as yesterday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow 
seemed to be downplaying that need. He was telling reporters that, look,
 Congress has already done a lot. But we've got economic warning sirens 
going off all around us, and it does seem as if the administration is 
now ready to push for more aggressive measures to help the economy, just
 as it's begun to do on the public health front.</p>
<p>INSKEEP: Yeah. The administration's earlier message - the president's
 earlier message, especially - was this will pass; it's temporary; we 
have a fundamentally strong economy. Now it's seeming less and less 
temporary. So what is the administration proposing to do?</p>
<p>HORSLEY: We don't know all of the details. Treasury Secretary Steve 
Mnuchin is expected to brief Republican senators later today. We 
understand that the package does include the $50 billion in aid that 
airlines have been asking for. Obviously, airlines have taken a beating 
during this crisis. But the package is also expected to include some 
help for struggling workers, and that could take a number of forms.</p>
<p>Up until now, the president and his administration have been pressing
 for a payroll tax cut. The problem with that is it does nothing to help
 people who are suddenly not on the payroll because their employer has 
closed its doors.</p>
<p>INSKEEP: Yeah.</p>
<p>HORSLEY: A payroll tax doesn't help tipped workers, who have taken a 
beating in this mess. And it's also regressive. It gives more money to 
higher wage earners. There are alternative proposals out there. 
Republican Senator Mitch - Mitt Romney of Utah has suggested just 
sending $1,000 to every American. Democratic senators have their own 
stimulus plan.</p>
<p>Mnuchin did say over the weekend that the president's open to other 
ideas for distributing this kind of mass assistance. But the White House
 still seems to be sticking with the payroll tax cut even though that 
idea has gotten little support on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>INSKEEP: Is - are the financial markets any more enthused about this than they have about any other administration proposals?</p>
<p>HORSLEY: U.S. stocks open up this morning. The Dow jumped more than 
400 points right at the get-go, about 2%. That rally fizzled pretty 
quickly. Right now the markets are roughly flat - flat to up and down. 
Flat's a relief after yesterday, though...</p>
<p>INSKEEP: (Laughter) Yeah.</p>
<p>HORSLEY: ...When the stock market had one of its worst days in 
history. Yesterday, the Dow plunged almost 3,000 points, the biggest 
point drop ever, the second-biggest percentage drop ever. So far this 
morning, trading at least has gone smoothly. We have not had to see the 
kind of temporary halt to trading to let investors catch their breath 
that we saw yesterday.</p>
<p>INSKEEP: Scott, I'm curious if anybody's talking, too, directly about
 small business owners who maybe don't have a lot of cushion. The 
payroll tax may not too directly help them. They're not going to get 
much from the airline bailout. Is there anything in there for those 
kinds of people who are desperately trying to stay open now or closing 
now?</p>
<p>HORSLEY: There certainly seems to be an awareness that those small 
business owners are maybe among the most vulnerable in this situation. 
We don't know what form that relief might take. But certainly, there is 
an awareness that the mom-and-pops are in need of some help here.</p>
<p>INSKEEP: OK. There will be much more to report through the day as we 
learn more details of the president's proposed $850 billion stimulus 
package, not to mention counterproposals from Republicans and Democrats 
on Capitol Hill. And NPR chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley 
will be with us throughout all of it.</p>
<p>Scott, thanks so much.</p>
<p>HORSLEY: Good to be with you, Steve.</p>
