<p> As many as two million New Yorkers could lack access to enough food 
because of the economic fallout from coronavirus, Mayor de Blasio said 
Thursday.</p>
<p> About 1.2 million people were food insecure in the city even before 
the five boroughs were hit by the pandemic, which is expected to put an 
estimated half-million New Yorkers out of work.</p>
<p> “The number of people who are food insecure is unquestionably going 
up,” de Blasio said during a briefing. “I fear the number’s going to be 
around two million New Yorkers who are food insecure as this crisis 
deepens, and that’s a horrifying number.”</p>
<p> Last week de Blasio announced the city will <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-hunger-initiative-pandemic-new-york-city-20200415-n5mml5c4orhizhq37c5duawa3e-story.html">spend $170 million in the coming months to ensure no New Yorkers go hungry because of coronavirus</a>. The city expects to deliver 10 million free meals to residents in April and up to 15 million meals in May.</p>
<p class=""> Grab-and-go meals are available at <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/food/free-meals">435 school sites as part of this effort</a>.</p>

<p> Halal meals are available at all sites. But the city will expand 
Halal meal access at 32 sites in neighborhoods with large Muslim 
populations during the month of Ramadan, which starts Thursday. 
Initially, the 32 sites weren’t listed online Thursday morning.</p>
<p> “We have to be smart about getting information out in real time,” de
 Blasio said of the flub. “In the rush of events here, sometimes things 
are missed.”</p>
