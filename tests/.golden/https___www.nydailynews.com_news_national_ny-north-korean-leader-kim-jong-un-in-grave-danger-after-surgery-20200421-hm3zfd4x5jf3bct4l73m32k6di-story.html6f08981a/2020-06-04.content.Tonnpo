<h1 class="rm-manual">North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in ’grave danger’ after heart surgery: report</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span>By <a href="file:///lauren-theisen-staff.html#nt=byline" rel="author"><span>Lauren Theisen</span></a> </span> </p>

<p> In this Saturday, April 11 photo provided by the North Korean 
government on Sunday, April 12, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attends a
 politburo meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea in Pyongyang. <span>(朝鮮通信社/AP)</span></p>
<p> North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is reportedly in “grave danger” after <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-politics/north-koreas-kim-getting-treatment-after-cardiovascular-procedure-report-idUSKBN223011">undergoing treatment for a cardiovascular problem</a>.</p>
<p> A US official with direct knowledge <a href="https://twitter.com/passantino/status/1252409726337310726">told CNN Monday</a> night that U.S. intelligence is monitoring reports about the condition of the head of the isolated country. <a href="https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1252426458863026177?s=20">Bloomberg reported</a>
 that Kim underwent heart surgery last week, and U.S. officials did not 
know if he was alive or dead. The Trump administration is looking into 
the potential line of succession after Kim, they said.</p>
<p> South Korea’s government-funded Yonhap news agency, however, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-politics/south-korea-says-north-koreas-kim-is-not-seriously-ill-yonhap-idUSKBN2230AV">contradicted those reports</a>, saying that Kim was not seriously ill.</p>
<p> Speculation has run rampant around the 36-year-old Kim’s health in 
recent days. Reports out of South Korea claim it has deteriorated over 
the past several months because of his heavy smoking habit, obesity and 
overwork.</p>
<p> Kim was last seen in public at a government meeting on April 11, but
 fueled rumors about his condition when he did not make any kind of 
appearance on April 15. That date, a national holiday in North Korea, 
celebrates the birth of Kim’s grandfather and the country’s founder, Kim
 Il Sung.</p>
<p> In some cases, glaring absences from important events signify major 
developments in North Korea, such as when Kim Jong Il missed the 
country’s 60th anniversary celebration because of a stroke, which 
eventually led to his declining health and death in 2011. But other 
times, not showing up has turned out to mean nothing, and there has been
 no shortage of false rumors regarding Kim and his family.</p>
<p> North Korea tightly controls all information about Kim, making it a 
challenge to know the truth about the leader — especially when it comes 
to his health. Kim commands a cult of personality in his country, and 
gaining insight about his situation often amounts to scanning state 
media reports and propaganda videos for clues.</p>
<p> The Ministry of Unification, a department of the South Korean 
government that aims to unify the two countries, said on Friday that it 
was “inappropriate” to speculate about Kim’s noticeable absence.</p>

<p> Kim has disappeared from the public eye for health reasons at least 
once before. Back in 2014, he wasn’t seen for over a month, and when he 
returned, he was using a cane. South Korea intelligence analysts later 
deduced that Kim had had a cyst removed from his ankle.</p>
<p> North Korea is currently facing a health crisis on a larger scale 
than just its leader, as it tries to protect itself against the 
coronavirus pandemic. The country has quarantined thousands and delayed 
the school year as precautionary measures, but claims to currently have 
zero infections. <a href="https://apnews.com/c94f460ca06cb5e9fe18d74dd4515750">Experts have cast doubt</a>
 on those claims, however, particularly because North Korea shares a 
border with China, which is often crossed for smuggling purposes.</p>
<p> Kim took power after his father’s death in December 2011 and is the 
third generation of his family to rule the nuclear-armed country.</p>
<p> He met President Trump three times in 2018 and 2019 and had summits 
with other Asian leaders as he pursued diplomacy in hopes of ending 
crippling sanctions and getting security guarantees. Yet he maintained 
his right to a nuclear arsenal and most diplomacy has stalemated since.</p>
