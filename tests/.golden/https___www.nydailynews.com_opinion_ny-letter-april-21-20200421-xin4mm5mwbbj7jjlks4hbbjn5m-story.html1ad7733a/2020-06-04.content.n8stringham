<h1 class="rm-manual">Readers sound off on the NYPD, dying from COVID-19, and New Jersey businesses</h1>

<h2 class="rm-manual"> The NYPD needs more than just PPE</h2>
<p> Manhattan: There is one thing criminal justice reformers can agree 
with the PBA about as COVID-19 explodes across New York: Our leaders in 
government have failed New Yorkers (“How NYC failed cops, again,” op-ed,
 April 17).</p>
<p> It is unconscionable that frontline responders are forced to work 
without adequate personal protective equipment. But the problem for NYPD
 officers’ safety goes beyond lacking PPE; it is the failure of our 
leadership to re-evaluate policing priorities during a pandemic despite a
 decrease in overall crime and a rapid increase of confirmed COVID-19 
cases amongst NYPD.</p>
<p> We recently sent a letter to Commissioner Dermot Shea urging the 
NYPD drastically reduce unnecessary arrests by increasing the use of 
verbal warnings, non-criminal citations, and appearance tickets for all 
low-level offenses. This recommendation is consistent with what has been
 urged by public health experts as well as the International Association
 of Chiefs of Police — the world’s largest professional association for 
police leaders. Other police departments have already curtailed 
low-level arrests and modified protocols to minimize unnecessary 
contacts that could spread the virus. The NYPD must do the same.</p>
<p> Truly protecting NYPD officers, and in turn all New Yorkers, 
requires re-evaluating the methods we use to reach our public health 
goals. We must decarcerate more rapidly, cease unnecessary arrests for 
low-level offenses and dated low-level warrants, and rely on public 
health and medical experts to lead us out of this public health crisis. 
We simply cannot police our way out of a public health pandemic.

<h2> What the Dr. ordered</h2>
<p> New Rochelle, N.Y.: I cannot remember being this moved and 
spiritually uplifted (“You are not alone,” op-ed, April 15). This 
remarkable woman’s words and actions provided people facing death with a
 gentle journey. Dr. Elizabeth Fontana understands that death from 
coronavirus is a shared trauma; it’s like a battlefield where those lost
 leave part of their being with their comrades — the medics in the 
field, doctors and nurses at field hospitals, and others. The 
coronavirus leaves its mark on us and the world we live in. Warren Gross</p>
<h2> Easing the pain</h2>
<p> Bayside: Unfortunately, I know of several families who have lost 
loved ones. I’ve heard horrible stories of not being able to say 
goodbye, delayed burials, no church services and the lack of closure 
without the proper grieving. Dr. Fontana has such an empathetic and kind
 relationship with the loved ones of those that she and others cared 
for. To Dr. Fontana and the families of the innocent victims, sorry for 
your losses. With sympathy and respect. Frank Macchio</p>
<h2> Paging Dr. Fontana</h2>
<p> Monroe Township, N.J.: It is amazing that Dr. Fontana was able to 
reach out to her patients and their families in such a kind and personal
 way during these difficult and stressful times. I hope she knows what a
 difference she made in their lives. If I am ever sick, she is the kind 
of doctor I would want at my bedside. Lorri Thompson</p>
<h2> New York legend</h2>
<p> Manhattan: Thanks for your article about the passing of saxophonist 
Giuseppi Logan (“Esteemed NYC jazz musician Giuseppi Logan dies of 
coronavirus: report,” April 18). I have fond memories of him playing in 
Tompkins Square Park. He was a pleasure to listen to. Katharine B. Wolpe</p>
<h2> Give them a break</h2>
<p> Manhattan: The actions of the Linden Center for Nursing and 
Rehabilitation nursing home in Brooklyn in handling the remains of 
deceased residents (“Lack of dignity at nursing home,” April 15) comply 
with the explicit and detailed guidelines issued by the office of chief 
medical examiner for situations just such as this. We can best support 
the elderly and frail among us with the compassion and dignity they 
deserve not by casting blame, but by making sure the federal, state and 
city governments are making sure the facilities that care for them have 
the staff, equipment and resources they need to provide proper care, in 
life and after death. Neil Heyman</p>
<h2> Roommates</h2>
<p> Hightstown, N.J.: Regarding the April 19 front-page story “Trapped” 
about Ms. Yoly Sanchez and the 11 people living in her two-bedroom 
apartment: The thing that I question is, why? Does New York have 
building codes? If they do, why are they not enforced? Or is enforcement
 selective and not blind? You cannot say the codes are federal law and 
ignore them like immigration statutes. Again, why are they not enforced?
 Simple question. Should not be too hard to answer. Guess it’s easier to
 look the other way. Jeff Applegate</p>
<h2> On that note</h2>
<p> Central Islip, L.I.: One bit of good news in the April 20 paper: “Mass shooter shot dead.” Thomas Sarc</p>
<h2> Over the river</h2>
<p> Cliffside Park, N.J.: Gov. Murphy is favoring big business and 
special interest groups over the backbone of our economy — small 
business. Small mom and pop retailers are closed all over the state, yet
 the big box retailers can sell the same products that they do. The 
small retailer is struggling to find a way to not only pay employees but
 to keep food on their table, and pay vendors for the inventory sitting 
on their shelves. A small business can control social distancing better 
than a large one. People want to get back to work and we need to help 
Main Street, not Wall Street. Why not allow these stores to open with 
reduced hours of operation? Or allow them to do phone orders with 
curbside pickup. If not then at the least big-box retailers should be 
restricted to food items only. Nick Blue</p>
<h2> Selective release</h2>
<p> Staten Island: I want to thank Voicer Tony Anastasio for his letter 
about our medical doctors convicted of non-violent crimes, such as 
financial malfeasance, who are still in federal prisons and the common 
criminals who are being set free. I tweeted at Gov. Cuomo on March 25 
about this right after he asked health-care professionals to volunteer 
to help fight the COVID-19 epidemic. I suggested these doctors be 
released in exchange for a reduction of their sentences. I received no 
acknowledgment to my tweet. Rosina Bianco</p>

<h2> In conclusion</h2>
<p> Brookfield, Conn.: I can’t believe some of the letters I’ve been 
reading on this page lately. China started this virus, allowed it to 
spread and lied about it later, but don’t call it the “Chinese Virus” 
because that’s racist. Instead, blame it on the American president! 
Liberals are thanking their lucky stars for the virus because it gives 
them something else to bash Trump with. What a thing to cheer for! And 
to Voicers Norah Mason, Jim Heimbuch and John J. Convery: If those 
stimulus checks are such a problem for you, you can simply refuse to 
cash them. But you won’t, will you? Fred Schoeneborn</p>
