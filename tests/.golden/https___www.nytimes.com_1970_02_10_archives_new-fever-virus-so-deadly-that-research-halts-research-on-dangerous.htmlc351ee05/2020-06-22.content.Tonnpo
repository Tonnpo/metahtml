<p>American doctors have dis covered a virus so virulent that they have stopped their research into its mysteries.</p>
<p>The virus, called Lassa Fever, killed three of the five Americans it 
infected during the last year. Those infected were three American mis 
sionary nurses, who con tracted the disease in Ni geria, and two 
laboratory workers at Yale University. Two of the nurses and one of the 
laboratory workers died.</p>
<p>Scientists at Yale, collabo rating with doctors at Co lumbia 
University and in West Africa, identified the virus last year from blood
 samples of the three nurses.</p>
<p>Blood tests show that none of the other laboratory or hospital 
personnel or family members got sick from Lassa Fever, although the 
virus possibly infected an other American missionary in Guinea a few 
years ago, doctors at Yale and Columbia said in recent interviews.</p>
<p>The episode vividly illus trates the hazards of virology research, 
which has led to at least 2,700 cases and 107 deaths from laboratory ac 
quired infections over the years. Most of these cases have occurred 
since 1950 as more researchers have tried to better understand viruses 
and have discovered new ones, almost as virulent as Lassa Fever, among 
the hun dreds of viruses previously known.</p>
<p>Just as important, Lassa Fever demonstrates that dis ease is not restricted by geo graphic or political boun daries.</p>
<p>Lassa Fever infection can involve almost all the body's organs; 
symptoms may vary in the individual patient. The virus produces a fever 
as high as 107 degrees; mouth ulcers; a skin rash with tiny hemorrhages;
 pneumonia; in fection of the heart leading to cardiac failure; kidney 
damage, and severe muscle aches.</p>
<p>The Yale researchers knew of the hazards when they re ceived blood samples from the three missionaries.</p>
<p>“We were aware of the dan gers of our research, but we had 
commitments to the doe tors and patients,” said Dr. Jordi Casals, the 
virologist who later got Lassa Fever.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Dr. Casals and his co‐worker, Dr. Sonja Buck ley, 
proceeded cautiously. Only by inoculating the victims’ blood into Vero 
cells (from a green monkey) were research ers able to show quickly evi 
dence of a virus, and only after months of tests were they able to say 
it was new.</p>
<p>By custom, they named it for the place from which it came, which was 
Lassa, a vil lage of about 1,000 Nigerians, situated about 150 miles 
below the Sahara.</p>
<p>2 Deaths in Africa</p>
<p>There, while working near the Church of the Brethren's mission 
station, the first nurse, Laura Wine, became ill. Flown by private plane
 to the Sudan Interior Mission's hospital in Jos, she died 24 hours 
later.</p>
<p>A week later, Charlotte Shaw, one of Miss Wine's nurses, got what she
 thought was migraine headache. However, she devel oped a fever 
unresponsive to antibiotics, became sicker, and died 10 days later.</p>
<p>Assisting at Miss Shaw's autopsy was Lily Pinneo, a missionary nurse, who had cared for both earlier victims.</p>
<p>“A week later, I got a 103‐ degree fever and severe ulcers in my 
mouth,” Miss Pinned re called at her home in Rochester. Considering that
 she might have the same illness, Miss Pin ?? doctors flew her to Lagos.
 She spent four days in a hos pital, cared for by Dr. Stanley O, Foster,
 a United States Pub lic Health Service physician.</p>
<p>Lying on a stretcher in a curtained‐off area of cabin and accompanied
 by a nurse and an other Health Service physician, Dr. J. Lyle Conrad, 
she spent 12 hours on a direct flight here.</p>
<p>From John F. Kennedy In ternational Airport, where of ficials had no 
reason to suspect a new viral disease, an ambu lance took Miss Pinneo to
 Columbia‐Presbyterian Hospital. Also at the airport was Dr. John D. 
Frame, who drew a blood sample from Miss Pinneo and sent it along with 
those previously obtained from the two dead missionaries to the Yale 
Arborvirus Research Unit.</p>
<p>At Columbia‐Presbyterian, Miss Pinneo was isolated. Her, doctors ruled out the known tropical diseases.</p>
<p>“After a few days, we real ized that hers was not a usual disease,” 
recalled one of her physicians, Dr. David J. Gocke, who said that they 
looked to the Yale laboratory for Miss Pinneo's diagnosis. Except for 
excellent nursing care, her doc tors had no specific therapy to offer.</p>
<p>Miss Pinneo remained hos pitalized for nine weeks, losing 28 pounds 
and most of her hair. Since she could “swallow just a sip at a time,” 
her doctors fed, her by vein for five weeks.</p>
<p>“My eyes kept jerking from side to side and I couldn't watch 
television, so I listened to my favorite hymns on the radio,” Miss 
Pinneo said.</p>
<p>At Yale, researchers studied the effects of the virus on animals such
 as mice but they said only Dr. Casals, Dr. Buck ley and Dr. Wilbur G. 
Downs, the group's director, worked with the virus.</p>
<p>In June, Dr. Casals felt ill but did not suspect he had Lassa Fever 
because his severe thigh‐muscle aching was sympton that the others had 
escaped. A friend urged Dr. Casals, who lives here, to enter 
Columbia‐Presbyterian Hospital. There, physicians suspected Lassa Fever 
as a laboratory acquired infection.</p>
<p>Against the Infection</p>
<p>Since antibiotics are ineffec tive against viruses, his doc tors used
 a therapy, common in prevaccine and preantibiotic days, but seldom used
 now, to save Dr. Casals's life. They asked Miss Pinneo to fly to New 
York from Rochester. They withdrew two units of blood and separated her 
plas ma, which contained the anti bodies she had made to fight her 
infection, and injected it into Dr. Casals's veins.</p>
<p>Miss Pinneo's plasma also worked against Dr. Casals's in fection. The
 virus stopped cir culating in Dr. Casals's blood immediately after this
 specific therapy was given, laboratory tests later showed, whereas it 
was found in Miss Pinneo's un treated blood for six weeks.</p>
<p>Dr. Casals returned to Yale to learn how many other Afri cans or 
missionaries, if any, have the disease and how it is transmitted. But 
this research was stopped when a laboratory worker, Juan Roman, who had 
no known contact with the vi rus, died in December. He left for a 
Thanksgiving vacation in York, Pa., where he became ill and was 
hospitalized.</p>
<p>Yale researchers say they learned of his illness just be fore he died
 there. And from blood samples Dr. Casals ob tained in York, Dr. Buckley
 identified the Lassa Fever virus.</p>
<p>“We simply do not know how the virus was transmitted to the 
technician,” Dr. Downs, the group's director, said. Any future research,
 he said, would have to be conducted in a maximum security laboratory.</p>
<p>Dr. Downs, meanwhile, has written laboratories in Africa warning them
 of the dangers of the virus and communicat ing what is known about the 
fat covered, spherical particle, which contains RNA (ribonu cleic acid) 
and can be seen only under an electron micro scope.</p>
<p class="">The researchers say they be lieve there Is no threat now to 
anyone associated with these cases. In such an event, Dr. Downs said, 
his laboratory would do all necessary tests for diagnostic, purposes.</p>
