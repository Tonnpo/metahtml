<p>SEOUL, South Korea — When North Korea held a state funeral for its 
leader, Kim Jong-il, in 2011, one son was conspicuously absent.</p>
<p>The absence of Kim Jong-nam — the eldest son of the family, who was 
bound by Korean tradition to preside over the funeral — was all the 
evidence outside analysts needed to see how isolated he had become from 
the center of power in North Korea, the world’s most secretive regime.</p>
<p>Never fully accepted by his family, sidelined by his powerful 
stepmother and haunted by fears of assassins, Mr. Kim lived much of his 
life wandering abroad, in Moscow, Geneva, Beijing, Paris and Macau, the 
Chinese gambling enclave.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mr. Kim, 45, met his end at Kuala Lumpur International 
Airport in Malaysia. According to the National Intelligence Service of 
South Korea, he was poisoned by two women who appeared to be carrying 
out an assassination order from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Mr.
 Kim died on his way to the hospital. Two women have been detained in 
connection with the killing.</p>
<p>It remains uncertain if Mr. Kim was traveling alone or if bodyguards 
were present. It was also unclear how many people were involved in the 
attack.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/02/15/clearer-image-of-killer-caught-on-cctv/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grainy footage</a>
 released on Wednesday showed a woman suspected of being one of the 
assassins, who appeared to be of Asian descent and wore a shirt 
emblazoned with “LOL” in large letters, before she fled the airport.</p>
<p>The Royal Malaysia Police announced late Wednesday afternoon that 
they had arrested a woman that morning and that she had been carrying a 
Vietnamese passport in Terminal 2, where the attack occurred. They said 
she was “positively identified” from closed-circuit video, and was alone
 at the time of her arrest.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Malaysian police said they had detained a second 
suspect, a woman with an Indonesian passport. A police official told the
 Bernama news agency that more arrests were expected.</p>
<p>The authorities also said that an autopsy on Mr. Kim had been completed.</p>
<p>There were no markers or police tape at Terminal 2 on Wednesday to 
indicate that a crime had been committed. Airport workers said that they
 had been ordered not to discuss the case.</p>
<p>South Korea’s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, said on Wednesday that
 his government was working with the Malaysian authorities to find the 
assailants. But officials in Seoul quickly pointed fingers at Mr. Kim’s 
half brother, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who has ordered the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/world/asia/north-korea-executed-15-top-officials-in-2015-south-korean-agency-says.html">executions of a number of senior officials</a>, including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/world/asia/north-korea-purge.html">his own uncle</a>, who have been deemed potential challenges to his authority.</p>
<p>Ever since Kim Jong-un succeeded his father in 2011, “there has been a
 standing order” to assassinate his half brother, Lee Byung-ho, the 
director of the South’s National Intelligence Service, said during a 
closed-door briefing at the National Assembly, according to lawmakers 
who attended it.</p>
<p>“This is not a calculated action to remove Kim Jong-nam because he 
was a challenge to power per se, but rather reflected Kim Jong-un’s 
paranoia,” Mr. Lee was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-un wanted his half brother killed, Mr. Lee said, and there 
was an assassination attempt against him in 2012. Mr. Kim was so afraid 
of assassins that he begged for his life in a letter to his half brother
 in 2012.</p>

 withdraw the order to punish me and my family,” Mr. Kim was quoted as 
saying in the letter. “We have nowhere to hide. The only way to escape 
is to choose suicide.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lee said that Kim Jong-nam had no power base inside North Korea, 
where Kim Jong-un had swiftly established his monolithic rule with what 
the South called a reign of terror.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-nam arrived in Malaysia last week, Mr. Lee said. He was in 
line at the airport to check in for a flight to Macau on Monday morning 
when he was attacked by the two women, Mr. Lee said, citing security 
camera footage from the airport. The women fled the airport in a taxi, 
Mr. Lee said.</p>
<p>If North Korea’s involvement is proved, Washington could face intense
 pressure to put the country back on its list of nations that sponsor 
terrorism, said Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the Sejong Institute, a
 think tank in South Korea.</p>
<p>North Korea was first put on the terrorism list after the South 
caught a woman from the North who confessed to planting a bomb on a 
South Korean airliner that exploded over the Indian Ocean, near Myanmar,
 in 1987. The North was taken off the list in 2008, after a deal aimed 
at ending its nuclear program.</p>
<p>South Korea’s military plans to use loudspeakers along the shared 
Korean border to inform North Koreans of Mr. Kim’s killing and of their 
government’s brutality, a South Korean news agency, Yonhap, reported on 
Wednesday. The Defense Ministry declined to confirm the report.</p>
<p>“By assassinating Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong-un may have removed a thorn 
in the side, but it will further isolate his country,” Mr. Cheong said. 
“It is also expected to worsen his country’s relations with China, which
 has been protecting his brother.”</p>

<p>While the lives of the rest of the family remained shrouded in 
mystery, Mr. Kim, the oldest of three known sons of Kim Jong-il, has 
been the closest thing the isolated Stalinist state has had to an 
international playboy.</p>
<p>He was often seen with fashionably dressed women in international airports and <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/world/asia/01iht-macao.4431509.html">spent much of his time in casinos in Macau</a>, where he also kept an expensive house.</p>
<p>Outside analysts often saw him as a possible candidate to replace Kim
 Jong-un if the North Korean leadership imploded and China, 
traditionally an ally, sought a replacement in its client state.</p>
<p>Chinese experts on North Korea said they doubted that Kim Jong-nam had special security protection from Beijing.</p>
<p>“Chinese elites had no expectation this guy could play an important 
political role,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of 
international relations at Renmin University. “If China wanted to use 
him as an alternative leader, China would have offered good protection, 
but this assassination shows he had no security protection.”</p>
<p>In Macau, where Mr. Kim was headed, he was safe just by being there, 
said Zhang Baohui, director of the Center for Asian Pacific Studies at 
Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “Macau is part of China and is a safe 
haven in itself,” he said.</p>

 Kim was a prince in exile with little chance of returning home, 
analysts and officials in South Korea said. His wife and a daughter and 
son are in Macau under Chinese protection, Mr. Lee said.</p>
<p>The South Korean intelligence agency did not disclose how it had 
obtained the letter from Mr. Kim begging his half brother to spare his 
life. But government sources said that emails Mr. Kim sent home through 
North Korean embassies had been obtained in a hacking operation. In one 
of the emails, they said, Mr. Kim bitterly complained that the North 
Korean government stopped sending him cash after his father died and Kim
 Jong-un took over. In 2012, a news report said Mr. Kim was thrown out 
of a luxury Macau hotel, unable to pay a $15,000 bill.</p>
<p>The Kim family has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/world/asia/family-intrigue-shadows-north-koreas-secretive-dynasty.html">never been known for its togetherness</a>.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-nam’s mother, Sung Hae-rim, a decorated “people’s actress,” 
was already married and the mother of a child when Kim Jong-il forced 
her to divorce her novelist husband to marry him. Kim Jong-il adored his
 first son, Kim Jong-nam. He once seated his young son at his desk and 
told him, “This is the place where you will one day give orders,” 
according to Lee Han-young, a relative who defected to the South in 
1982.</p>
<p>But Kim Jong-nam’s grandfather, the North’s founding president, Kim Il-sung, never approved of the marriage.</p>
<p>“My father was keeping highly secret the fact that he was living with
 my mother, who was married, a famous movie actress, so I couldn’t get 
out of the house or make friends,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in a 
2012 book by a Japanese journalist. “That solitude from childhood may 
have made me what I am now, preferring freedom.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kim was born in secret, and when his mother fell out of favor 
with Kim Jong-il and was forced to live in Moscow, he was left in the 
care of her sister. He was later sent to Geneva, where he learned 
English and French. (His mother was alone in Moscow when she died in 
2002.)</p>
<p>Kim Jong-il would later begin a relationship with Ko Young-hee, a 
star of Pyongyang’s premier opera, who gave birth to Kim Jong-chol and 
then Kim Jong-un. According to a Japanese sushi chef who published a 
2003 memoir about his experience working for the Kim family, Kim Jong-un
 was by that time the father’s favorite.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-nam squandered what little chance he may have had to succeed his father when he embarrassed Pyongyang in 2001; he was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/04/world/japan-deports-man-said-to-be-north-korean-leader-s-son.html">caught trying to enter Japan</a> on a fake passport from the Dominican Republic. He told Japanese investigators that he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.</p>
<p>But rumors of intrigue never left Mr. Kim, as analysts speculated 
that if the young, inexperienced Kim Jong-un failed to meet the 
expectations of hard-line generals, they might summon home the eldest 
brother. In a way, Mr. Kim helped fuel such rumors.</p>
<p class="">In the 2012 book by the Japanese journalist, Mr. Kim called his younger brother “a figurehead.”</p>
