Experts disagree.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">As the United States continues its advance toward 100,000 coronavirus deaths, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html">a grim milestone</a>
 the country is expected to reach in the coming days, President Trump 
and members of his administration have begun questioning the official 
coronavirus death toll, suggesting the numbers are inflated. </p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-death-toll.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Most experts say the opposite is likely the case</a>.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In White House meetings, conversations with health officials have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-death-toll.html">returned to similar suspicions</a>:
 that the data compiled by state health departments and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention include people who have died with the 
coronavirus but of other conditions. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Last Friday, Mr. Trump told reporters that he 
accepted the current death toll, but that the figures could be “lower 
than” the official count, which now totals more than 95,000.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/opinion/coronavirus-us-deaths.html">statisticians</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/coronavirus-deaths-undercount.html">public health experts</a>
 say he is wrong; the death toll is probably far higher than what is 
publicly known. People are dying at their houses and nursing homes 
without ever being tested, they say, and deaths early this year were 
likely misidentified as influenza or described only as pneumonia.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House’s coronavirus 
response coordinator, has said publicly that the American health care 
system incorporates a generous definition of a death caused by Covid-19.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“There are other countries that if you had a 
pre-existing condition, and let’s say the virus caused you to go to the 
I.C.U., and then have a heart or kidney problem — some countries are 
recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a Covid-19 
death,” she said at a White House news conference last month.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In a brief interview on Thursday, Dr. Birx stressed
 that there had been no pressure to alter data. But concerns about 
official statistics are not limited to the death toll, or to 
administration officials.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Epidemiologists said they were stunned to learn 
that the C.D.C. is combining tests that detect active infection with 
those that detect recovery from Covid-19 — a system that muddies the 
picture of the pandemic but raises the percentage of Americans tested as
 President Trump boasts about testing.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Experts said that data from antibody tests and active virus tests should never be mixed.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“It just doesn’t make any sense,” said Natalie 
Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida. “All of us are 
really baffled.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Epidemiologists, state health officials and a 
spokeswoman for the C.D.C. said there was no ill intent; they attributed
 the flawed reporting system to confusion and fatigue in overworked 
state and local health departments that typically track infections — not
 tests — during outbreaks. </p>

<h2 class="rm-manual">‘We Need More Prayer,’ Trump Says, Calling Houses of Worship ‘Essential’</h2>
<h4 class="rm-manual">President Trump urged governors to reopen houses 
of worship immediately, saying he would override them if they did not. 
His authority to do so is unclear.</h4>
<dl class="rm-manual"><dd><p class="rm-manual">Today, I’m identifying 
houses of worship, churches, synagogues and mosques as essential places 
that provide essential services. Some governors have deemed liquor 
stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and
 other houses of worship. It’s not right. So I’m correcting this 
injustice, and calling houses of worship “essential.” I call upon 
governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now.
 These are places that hold our society together, and keep our people 
united. The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to 
their mosque. Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential
 part of life. The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith 
leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather 
and pray. I know them well, they love their congregations. They love 
their people. They don’t want anything bad to happen to them or to 
anybody else. The governors need to do the right thing, and allow these 
very important essential places of faith to open right now, for this 
weekend. If they don’t do it, I will override the governors. In America,
 we need more prayer, not less.</p></dd></dl>

 Trump stepped into the culture wars again on Friday, taking the side of
 some religious leaders against governors who have moved slowly in 
reopening places of worship amid the pandemic.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Without any clear authority to do so, Mr. Trump 
said that he was calling houses of faith, including churches, 
synagogues, and mosques, “essential services” and urged governors to 
reopen them “right now.” </p>
<p class="rm-manual">“Today I am identifying houses of worship — 
churches, synagogue and mosques — as essential places that provide 
essential services,” Mr. Trump said at a hastily scheduled briefing at 
the White House on Friday. “Some governors have deemed liquor stores and
 abortion clinics as essential but have left out churches and other 
houses of worship. It’s not right.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">After he spoke, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a number of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/politics/trump-cdc.html">long-delayed guidelines</a>
 with suggestions for steps that houses of worship can take to curb the 
spread of the virus. Among them was a recommendation that religious 
officials defer to the directive of state and local governments.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Still, the president threatened to “override” the 
governors if they did not follow his order, though it was not 
immediately clear what powers he was claiming. “I call upon governors to
 allow our churches and places of worship to open right now,” he said. 
“If there’s any question, they’re going to have to call me, but they’re 
not going to be successful in that call.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">When the C.D.C. recently released a set of guidelines for reopening, its report largely mirrored an earlier <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6935-CDC-opening-guidelines/e1a8802d0d76b3eb43a8/optimized/full.pdf#page=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">draft version</a>
 that the White House had rejected because Trump administration 
officials worried that the suggestions infringed on religious rights.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">On Friday the C.D.C.’s new guidelines for religious
 communities suggested that they consider a number of limitations to 
keep congregations safe. Among them:</p>
<ul class="rm-manual">
<li class="rm-manual"><p class="rm-manual">“Take steps to limit the size of gatherings in accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local authorities.”</p></li>
<li class="rm-manual"><p class="rm-manual">“Consider suspending or at 
least decreasing use of a choir/musical ensembles and congregant 
singing, chanting, or reciting during services or other programming, if 
appropriate within the faith tradition. The act of singing may 
contribute to transmission of Covid-19, possibly through emission of 
aerosols.”</p></li>
<li class="rm-manual"><p class="rm-manual">“Consider temporarily 
limiting the sharing of frequently touched objects that cannot be easily
 cleaned between persons, such as worship aids, prayer rugs, prayer 
books, hymnals, religious texts and other bulletins, books, shared cups,
 or other items received, passed or shared among congregants.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="rm-manual">Mr. Trump said Friday at the White House that the 
nation needs religion. “In America, we need more prayer, not less,” he 
said. He left without taking questions. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">David Postman, the chief of staff for Gov. Jay 
Inslee of Washington, said the state didn’t know what the president’s 
comments meant and noted the state had not seen any formal order. “We 
don’t believe the president has the ability to dictate what states can 
and cannot open,” Mr. Postman said.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Rhode Island’s governor, Gina Raimondo, was more blunt when told of the president’s comments, saying, “<a href="https://turnto10.com/news/local/raimondo-sticks-to-may-30-reopening-of-churches-as-trump-deems-them-essential" rel="noopener noreferrer">No, that’s not happening in Rhode Island</a>.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“We’re not ready,” she said. “Honestly, that would be reckless. It’s Friday. They’re not ready.”</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">States differ on their approaches to religious services during the pandemic.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Image</span></p>

Albino in Mesilla, N.M., have resorted to measures like distributing 
communion to parishioners in cars during the pandemic.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Paul Ratje/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></figcaption><p class="rm-manual">It
 was not clear what authority President Trump was invoking on Friday 
when he called for governors “to allow our churches and places of 
worship to open right now,” and threatened to “override” them if they 
did not. Soon after he spoke, though, the C.D.C. issued guidelines 
urging faith leaders to “take steps to limit the size of gatherings in 
accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local 
authorities.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">States and localities have been taking a variety of approaches to religious services since the outbreak began.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Houses of worship were already allowed to operate 
in more than half of the states, though many remain under social 
distancing instructions and many individual churches, synagogues and 
mosques have decided to remain closed for safety.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">There have been tensions in places that still have 
restrictions in place. In California, more than 1,200 pastors signed a 
declaration protesting the state’s restrictions on in-person services 
and pledged to reopen their churches by May 31 even if the restrictions 
are not lifted. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said Friday that the 
state was working with faith leaders on guidelines to reopen in “a safe 
and responsible manner” that would be released by Monday at the latest.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The state’s guidelines, which will distinguish 
between megachurches and smaller venues, deal with the configuration of 
pews and “sanitation protocols,” the governor said.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said on Friday that
 he would “continue to operate on the basis of science and data” in 
deciding when it was safe for houses of worship to open. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">“I’m as anxious as anybody to make sure that our 
churches, our mosques, our synagogues open back to where they were 
before Covid-19 came along,” Mr. Pritzker said. “We’re gradually moving 
in that direction. But there’s no doubt the most important thing is, we 
do not want parishioners to get ill because their faith leaders bring 
them together.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The president’s call to let in-person services 
resume came just before one of the biggest Muslim holidays of the year, 
Eid al-Fitr, which starts Saturday night.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Washington State currently allows drive-in 
services, where congregants remain in their vehicles, and allows houses 
of worship to bring in personnel to broadcast and stream videos of 
services. Officials there have been working with an interfaith group to 
develop guidelines on how religious institutions can safely open up for 
more in-person activities. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">And in some states, houses of worships were never 
required to close. In Pennsylvania, religious institutions were exempt 
from a stay-at-home order, though Gov. Tom Wolf has advised religious 
leaders not to hold in-person services or large gatherings to protect 
people from the virus. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who on Friday <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MIEOG/2020/05/22/file_attachments/1458387/EO%202020-100%20Emerg%20order%20-%20amendments.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended</a> the state’s stay-at-home order through June 12, has banned large gatherings but also said that houses of worship would <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98178_98455-522357--,00.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">not be subject to penalties</a>,
 leaving the decision in the hands of religious leaders. Many churches, 
synagogues and mosques there decided to remain closed anyway, and those 
that are reopening often remain under strict guidelines, including 
limiting the number of congregants who could enter.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In hard-hit New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo moved 
this week to allow religious gatherings of up to 10 people to resume as 
long as attendees wear masks and maintain social distance. The 
announcement was particularly significant for Jewish congregations, 
where a minyan, defined as 10 people over 13, is required for a worship 
service.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Birx expresses concerns about case levels in Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Image</span></p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"><span>A view of Venice Beach, Calif., on May 17.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Ryan Young for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption><p class="rm-manual">One
 testing measure shows that coronavirus cases are persisting at 
worrisome rates in three major metropolitan areas — Los Angeles, Chicago
 and Washington, D.C. — that are still under stay-at-home orders, a top 
White House official said on Friday.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“We have concerns of where cities have remained 
closed and metros that have remained closed but have still persistent 
high number of cases,” Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House’s 
coronavirus response coordinator, told reporters at a news conference. 
She said officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
were working with local officials in the three cities “to really 
understand where these new cases coming from, and what do we need to do 
to prevent them in the future.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Dr. Birx’s concern did not suggest that the case 
rates in the three regions were spiking to alarming new levels, but 
rather that they were not dropping at the same rate as in many other 
cities.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Dr. Birx singled out the Washington area — which 
includes the district as well as parts of Maryland and Virginia — and 
said it led the country in the percentage of positive test results, a 
measure different from total coronavirus cases. Among those who have 
tested positive is the former N.B.A. all-star Patrick Ewing, now the 
men’s basketball coach at Georgetown University in Washington, who 
announced on Twitter on Friday that he had the virus. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Unlike New York, the Washington area has seen no 
“dramatic decline” in positive test rates or emergency room visits, Dr. 
Birx said.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Further complicating the picture, Mayor Muriel E. 
Bowser of Washington said on Thursday that the city could begin a phased
 reopening as early as May 29, pointing to figures that showed a 
downward trend in spread of the virus for almost two weeks. Yet on the 
same day, Washington, D.C., and Virginia <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/here-are-your-live-dc-updates/65-cdc624c4-179b-41b3-9f0b-01091ca49b31" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanOnRecord/status/1263494043989917702" rel="noopener noreferrer">single-day highs</a> in cases.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The Washington region’s high positive-test 
percentage comes despite reassuring news in most states: 42 have a rate 
under 10 percent of positive test results as part of a rolling, 
seven-day average, Dr. Birx said.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The New York area, which includes Jersey City and 
Newark, is seeing steeper declines by that test result measure, Dr. Birx
 said. And cities that have been especially hard hit, such as Detroit, 
Boston and Miami, now have more promising daily case counts.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Ahead of a holiday weekend, beach towns are telling N.Y.C. residents to stay away.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Image</span></p>

Long Beach on Thursday. New York City residents will not be able to use

 the locals have put up barricades to limit parking and deployed 
enforcement officers to ticket outsiders. Jersey Shore towns have banned
 short-term leases and Airbnb rentals. And on Long Island, the Suffolk 
County executive’s office taunted Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City:
 “Do your job. Figure out a plan to safely reopen your beaches.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Since the pandemic began, tensions have flared over whether too many New York City residents have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/nyregion/coronavirus-leaving-nyc-vacation-homes.html">decamped to outlying vacation areas</a>,
 potentially taking the virus with them. But now the region appears on 
the brink of a full-fledged (and nasty) battle over beaches, touched off
 by the city’s decision to keep its shoreline closed.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In normal times, start of beach season on Memorial 
Day weekend incites a mass migration from New York to Long Island, the 
Jersey Shore and, to a lesser extent, Connecticut. But the extension of 
beach closings in New York City has led to a backlash from local 
officials in those areas, who say they fear that their shorelines will 
be overwhelmed by an exodus of sun-starved New Yorkers blocked from 
their own beaches, which can in normal times attract a million people a 
day.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">To maintain social distancing, beaches across the 
region are moving to limit access to everyone, and special rules have 
also been adopted to keep outsiders away. </p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">The Justice Dept. backs a lawsuit to block Illinois’s stay-at-home order.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">The Justice Department on Friday backed an Illinois
 Republican’s effort to invalidate the state’s stay-at-home order, the 
latest effort by the federal government to undermine governors’ 
coronavirus measures.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Illinois <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilsd.84687/gov.uscourts.ilsd.84687.15.0.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">argued in a legal brief</a> that Gov. J. B. Pritzker, a Democrat, had exceeded his authority by extending his executive order for more than 30 days.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The brief came in response to a directive from 
Attorney General William P. Barr that department lawyers review 
stay-at-home orders around the country “to ensure that civil liberties 
are protected.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Since Mr. Barr’s request, the Justice Department 
has increasingly asserted itself in arguing over the legality of states’
 sweeping orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“Under our system, all public officials, including 
governors, must comply with the law, especially during times of crisis,”
 Eric Dreiband, the head of the department’s civil rights division, said
 in a statement. On Friday, Mr. Dreiband also <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-22/trump-administration-garcetti-warning-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned in</a> <a href="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/62/5c/4c5878ad4ae3a77072c773ff423a/5-22-20-letter-to-la-mayor-and-health-director-ed.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">a letter</a> to Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles that a “long-term lockdown” could be illegal.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The move in Illinois came in a lawsuit that was 
filed by Darren Bailey, a Republican state representative whose fellow 
lawmakers kicked him out of the building in which they had gathered 
because he <a href="https://www.nprillinois.org/post/house-rep-ejected-face-mask-rule-breaking-state-lawmakers-greeted-protests#stream/0" rel="noopener noreferrer">refused to wear a mask</a>.
 Mr. Bailey had asked an Illinois court to declare the governor’s order 
invalid. The governor this week sought to have the case <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilsd.84687/gov.uscourts.ilsd.84687.1.0.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">transferred to federal court</a>, a move the Justice Department also said was wrong.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Airlines are permitted to stop flying to dozens of U.S. cities.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Image</span></p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"><span>A view of San Francisco International Airport on Friday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Jim Wilson/The New York Times</span></span></figcaption><p class="rm-manual">The Transportation Department said late Friday that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/business/coronavirus-airports-airlines.html">would tentatively allow</a>
 15 airlines to stop flights to about 60 mostly small and midsize 
cities, though none of the destinations stand to lose service entirely.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">American Airlines would be allowed to stop flying 
to airports in Worcester, Mass., and Aspen, Colo. Delta Air Lines would 
be able to stop service to Erie, Pa., and Flint, Mich. United Airlines 
would be able to stop flights to Fairbanks, Alaska; Kalamazoo, Mich.; 
and Myrtle Beach, S.C., among other locations.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">None of the cities would be left without service, 
the agency said, because it granted exemptions only if other airlines 
still flew there. Some of the affected regions are also served by other 
airports. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">The decision is rooted in the federal stimulus act 
passed in late March. Under that law, any airline that received federal 
assistance is required to maintain a minimum number of flights to 
locations that it had served before the pandemic. But the law also 
allowed the Transportation Department to grant exceptions, which it has 
done regularly for weeks.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Homeland security exempts some foreign athletes from travel restrictions. </h2>
<p class="rm-manual">The Department of Homeland Security late Friday 
provided exemptions for certain professional athletes from its travel 
restrictions that Trump administration officials have said are crucial 
to preventing the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The department said in a statement that foreign 
baseball, basketball, golf, hockey and tennis players, as well as their 
families and essential staff members, would be allowed to enter the 
United States. In his push to reopen the economy, President Trump has 
encouraged sports commissioners to resume play.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“Professional sporting events provide much-needed 
economic benefits, but equally important, they provide community pride 
and national unity,” said Chad F. Wolf, the acting secretary of the 
Department of Homeland Security. “In today’s environment, Americans need
 their sports.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In late January, the administration prohibited 
foreign travelers who had been in China within the previous 14 days from
 coming to the United States. The administration later put similar 
restrictions in place for those from Iran and many European countries, 
including Britain. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">The order on Friday said that allowing the athletes
 into the United States was within the “national interest.” But homeland
 security officials have defended using health authorities granted to 
the surgeon general to rapidly turn away asylum-seeking migrants at the 
southwestern border.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">As businesses navigate the pandemic, summer internships are sacrificed.</h2>

<h1 class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus">The Coronavirus Outbreak</a> </h1>
<ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h2 class="rm-manual">Frequently Asked Questions and Advice</h2> <p class="rm-manual">Updated May 28, 2020</p> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h4 class="rm-manual">My state is reopening. Is it safe to go out?</h4> <p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html">States are reopening bit by bit</a>.
 This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and 
more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government 
is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are
 leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren’t being 
told to stay at home, it’s still a good idea to limit trips outside and 
your interaction with other people.</p> </li> </ul> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h4 class="rm-manual">What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface?</h4> <p class="rm-manual">Touching
 contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not
 typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.905.8444&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">of studies</a>
 of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that 
respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by 
touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care 
centers, offices and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5519164/">hospitals</a>.
 But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that
 way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s 
surface transmission or close human contact — is still social 
distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing 
masks.</p> </li> </ul> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h4 class="rm-manual">What are the symptoms of coronavirus?</h4> <p class="rm-manual">Common symptoms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html">include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.</a>
 Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection 
difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html">The C.D.C. has also</a>
 added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the 
sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall 
ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few
 as two days or as many as 14 days.</p> </li> </ul> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h4 class="rm-manual">How can I protect myself while flying?</h4> <p class="rm-manual">If air travel is unavoidable,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html"> there are some steps you can take to protect yourself.</a> Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A <a href="http://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html">study from Emory University</a>
 found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a
 window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with 
potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your 
seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard 
surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, 
the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is 
hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. 
(Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading
 of germs rather than killing them.)</p> </li> </ul> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h4 class="rm-manual">How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?</h4> <p class="rm-manual">More
 than 40 million people — the equivalent of 1 in 4 U.S. workers — have 
filed for unemployment benefits since the pandemic took hold. One in 
five who were working in February reported losing a job or being 
furloughed in March or the beginning of April, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-jobless-unemployment.html">data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed</a>,
 and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 
percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less 
lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a
 Fed official said.</p> </li> </ul> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h4 class="rm-manual">Is ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease?</h4> <p class="rm-manual">There is an uptick in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html">people reporting symptoms of chilblains,</a>
 which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the 
winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">symptom</a>
 of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by 
inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp 
conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. 
Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of 
coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, 
saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.</p> </li> </ul> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h4 class="rm-manual">Can I go to the park?</h4> <p class="rm-manual">Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html">Even
 if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, 
getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.</a></p> </li> </ul> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h4 class="rm-manual">How do I take my temperature?</h4> <p class="rm-manual">Taking
 one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it 
sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an
 eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you
 don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-temperature-fever-thermometer.html">other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.</a></p> </li> </ul> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h4 class="rm-manual">Should I wear a mask?</h4> <p class="rm-manual">The C.D.C. has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">recommended</a> that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html"> new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms</a>.
 Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary 
people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part 
of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care 
workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in 
continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social 
distancing.</p> </li> </ul> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h4 class="rm-manual">What should I do if I feel sick?</h4> <p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have,</a>
 and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call
 a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, 
how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially
 infecting or exposing others.</p> </li> </ul> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h4 class="rm-manual">How do I get tested?</h4> <p class="rm-manual">If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have-coronavirus.html">the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. </a>They
 will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a 
chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re 
asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.</p> </li> </ul> <ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> <h4 class="rm-manual">How can I help?</h4> <p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=7779">Charity Navigator</a>,
 which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running 
list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You

<p class="rm-manual">“I feel like I had such a strong plan,” she said. 
“I knew what I was going to do — I had been working for it all of 
college. Now I don’t know what I’m going to do.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">For millions of college students, internships can 
be a steppingstone to full-time work, a vital source of income and even a
 graduation requirement.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">But like so much else, summer internships have been
 upended by the pandemic, with a wide range of major companies, 
including tech firms like Yelp and entertainment behemoths like the Walt
 Disney Company, canceling programs and rescinding offers. Instead, 
students who had hoped to experience an office setting for the first 
time are instead looking for work at fast-food restaurants.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">A vaccine developed in China appears to be safe and may offer protection against the virus, scientists say.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">The early-stage trial, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/lancet/article/s0140673620312083" rel="noopener noreferrer">published in the Lancet</a>,
 was conducted by researchers at several laboratories and included 108 
participants. Subjects who got the vaccine mounted a moderate immune 
response to the virus, which peaked 28 days after the inoculation, the 
researchers found.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">A vaccine to the new coronavirus is considered to 
be the best long-term solution to ending the pandemic and helping 
countries reopen their societies. Nearly 100 teams worldwide are racing 
to test various candidates.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">On Monday, Moderna announced that its RNA vaccine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/health/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna.html">appears to be safe and effective</a>,
 based on results from eight people in its trial. On Wednesday, 
researchers in Boston said a prototype vaccine protected monkeys from 
coronavirus infection.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The vaccine reported today was created with another virus, an adenovirus called Ad5 that easily enters human cells.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">But the virus is one that many people already have 
been exposed to, and some experts have worried that too many already 
have antibodies to Ad5, limiting its usefulness as a way to deliver a 
vaccine.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Although the vaccine did elicit some immune 
response, the results are based on data from just a short period. It is 
not clear how long-lasting the protection might be.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Apart from pain at the injection site, close to 
half of the participants also reported fever, fatigue and headaches, and
 about one in five had muscle pain.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The participants knew whether they were receiving a
 low, medium or high dose, however, which may have influenced their 
perceptions of the side effects.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Deadly diseases could surge after disruptions to vaccination programs.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Image</span></p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"><span>A health worker administered polio vaccines to children on a three-day vaccination campaign in Peshawar, Pakistan, in February.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Arshad Arbab/EPA, via Shutterstock</span></span></figcaption><p class="rm-manual">The
 widespread interruption of routine immunization programs around the 
world during the coronavirus pandemic is putting 80 million children 
under 1 year old at risk of contracting deadly, vaccine-preventable 
diseases, according to a report Friday by the World Health Organization,
 UNICEF and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The groups surveyed 129 poor and middle-income 
countries and found that 68 had some degree of disruption of vaccine 
services through clinics and through large inoculation campaigns.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Many public health experts say they are worried 
that deaths from diseases including cholera, rotavirus and diphtheria 
could far outstrip those from Covid-19 itself.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The problem of slipping vaccine rates is not limited to developing countries. This week,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/health/vaccinations-rates-coronavirus.html"> the C.D.C. reported that coverage rates among Michigan infants</a> had dropped below 50 percent for all childhood immunizations. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/nyregion/coronavirus-schools-vaccinations.html">New York City announced</a>
 that during a six-week period of pandemic lockdown, the number of 
vaccine doses administered to children dropped 63 percent, compared with
 the same period last year.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">International public health experts, including the W.H.O., <a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/news_guidance_immunization_services_during_COVID-19/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer">had initially recommended that mass vaccine programs </a>in
 particular be halted while the pandemic raged to protect against 
further spread occasioned by long lines of children waiting for shots.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">But officials are now moving toward a cautious risk-benefit analysis.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Employers are preparing to test their workers as they return to offices.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Image</span></p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"><span>A worker at the Venetian resort in Las Vegas, Wesley Smith, is tested for the coronavirus.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Bridget Bennett for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption><p class="rm-manual">As
 the country reopens, employers are looking into how to safely bring 
back their workers. One recurring question: Should they be tested for 
the new coronavirus?</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Some businesses are moving ahead. Amazon plans to 
spend as much as $1 billion this year to regularly test its work force, 
while laying the groundwork to build its own lab near the Cincinnati 
airport.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Las Vegas casinos are testing thousands of 
employees as they prepare to return to work, collecting nasal samples in
 convention halls. Gov. Steve Sisolak of Nevada is hoping to reopen the 
state’s gambling industry by June 4, he said on Friday.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">And Major League Baseball, eager to begin its 
season, is proposing a detailed regimen that involves testing players 
and critical staff members multiple times a week.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">While public health experts and government 
officials have emphasized that widespread testing will be critical to 
reopening, state and federal agencies have given little clear guidance 
on the role employers should play in detecting and tracking the virus. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Despite rapid advancements in testing, many 
limitations remain. Diagnostic tests, for example, only detect 
infections during a certain period. And antibody tests alone should not 
be used to make decisions about when people can return to work, the 
Association of Public Health Laboratories and Council of State and 
Territorial Epidemiologists <a href="https://www.aphlblog.org/antibody-testing-important-covid-19-response-data-needed-expand-role/" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned</a>.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Some public health officials also said that broad-based testing might have unintended consequences.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“We don’t want people to get a false sense of 
security,” said Karen Landers, a district medical officer with the 
Alabama Department of Public Health, which is not recommending that 
employers test all workers.</p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">The virus still does not spread easily on surfaces, the C.D.C. says.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guidelines from the C.D.C.</a> making the rounds online this week are clarifying what we know about the spread of the virus.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The virus does not spread easily via contaminated 
surfaces, according to the agency. For those who were worried about 
wiping down grocery bags or disinfecting mailed packages, the<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/cdc-now-says-coronavirus-does-not-spread-easily-via-contaminated-surfaces" rel="noopener noreferrer"> news headlines</a> highlighting<a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/cdc-virus-does-not-spread-easily-on-surfaces/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> this guidance</a> in<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/20/cdc-now-says-coronavirus-does-not-spread-easily-on-surfaces/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> recent days</a> might have brought some relief.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">But this information is not new; the agency has 
been using similar language for months. If anything, the headlines have 
pulled into sharper focus what we already know. The virus is thought to 
spread mainly from one person to another, typically through droplets 
when an infected person sneezes, coughs or talks at close range — even 
if that person is not showing symptoms.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The C.D.C.’s website also says that “touching a 
surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own 
mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes” is a possible way for people to 
become infected. But those are “not thought to be the main way the virus
 spreads.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">According to<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> cached versions of the website that are available online</a>,
 this language has remained largely unchanged since at least late March.
 But it appears to have drawn more attention after it was placed under a
 new subheading<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200511163242/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"> on May 11</a>, when information about the difficulty of catching the virus from animals was added.</p>

 in some way, some epidemiologists are seeing warning signs of a 
possible resurgence in the South, including Montgomery, Ala., where 
Mayor Steven L. Reed raised alarms going into the holiday weekend. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Mr. Reed, who earlier this week said there was just
 one I.C.U. bed remaining at certain area hospitals, said he spoke out 
after hearing from hospital leaders that the situation was becoming 
unsustainable. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">“We are in a very dangerous predicament,” he said on MSNBC on Thursday night. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Mr. Reed, a Democrat whose position is officially 
nonpartisan, attributed an uptick in cases in Montgomery to changes in 
people’s behavior amid an early decision by Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican,
 to relax restrictions across Alabama, including the reopening of 
entertainment venues on Friday.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“It has sent a message that the battle with 
Covid-19 is over and it has been won,” he said. “We are still in this 
battle. We can’t afford to relax now.” </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Mia Mothershed, a spokeswoman for Jackson Hospital 
in Montgomery, said on Friday that the hospital had reached capacity in 
its 30 I.C.U. beds because of a combination of the virus and other 
patients. “We have absolutely no beds available here,” she said.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/alabama-coronavirus-cases.html">Alabama has seen more than 13,000 known cases</a>

<h2 class="rm-manual">China abandons a growth target for the year and more from our international correspondents.</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">Parting with years of precedent, China on Friday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/economy/coronavirus-china-economy.html">abandoned an annual growth target for 2020</a>,
 in an acknowledgment that restarting its economy after the outbreak

meeting in Beijing, Premier Li Keqiang said that the country had made 
major achievements in its response to the epidemic and that economic 
development was a top priority. But while he set goals to limit 
inflation and unemployment, he did not announce a target for economic 
growth for the year.</p>
