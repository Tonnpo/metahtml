<p>TOORBUL, Australia — The first sign is the smell: smoky, like a 
campfire, with a hint of urine. The second is the koala’s rear end: If 
it is damp and inflamed, with streaks of brown, you know the animal is 
in trouble. Jo, lying curled and unconscious on the examination table, 
had both.</p>
<p>Jo is a wild koala under the purview of Endeavour Veterinary Ecology,
 a wildlife consulting company that specializes in bringing sick koala 
populations back from the brink of disease. Vets noticed on their last 
two field visits that she was sporting “a suspect bum,” as the 
veterinarian Pip McKay put it. So they brought her and her 1-year-old 
joey into the main veterinary clinic, which sits in a remote forest 
clearing in Toorbul, north of Brisbane, for a full health check.</p>
<p>Ms. McKay already had an inkling of what the trouble might be. “Looking at her, she probably has chlamydia,” she said.</p>
<p>Humans don’t have a monopoly on sexually transmitted infections. 
Oysters get herpes, rabbits get syphilis, dolphins get genital warts. 
But chlamydia — a pared-down, single-celled bacterium that acts like a 
virus — has been especially successful, infecting everything from frogs 
to fish to parakeets. You might say chlamydia connects us all.</p>
<p>This shared susceptibility has led some scientists to argue that 
studying, and saving, koalas may be the key to developing a long-lasting
 cure for humans. “They’re out there, they’ve got chlamydia, and we can 
give them a vaccine, we can observe what the vaccine does under real 
conditions,” <a href="https://www.usc.edu.au/staff-repository/professor-peter-timms" rel="noopener noreferrer">said Peter Timms</a>,
 a microbiologist at the University of Sunshine Coast in Queensland. He 
has spent the past decade developing a chlamydia vaccine for koalas, and
 is now conducting trials on wild koalas, in the hopes that his formula 
will soon be ready for wider release. “We can do something in koalas you
 could never do in humans,” Dr. Timms said.</p>
<p>In koalas, chlamydia’s ravages are extreme, leading to severe 
inflammation, massive cysts and scarring of the reproductive tract. In 
the worst cases, animals are left yelping in pain when they urinate, and
 they develop the telltale smell. But the bacteria responsible is still 
remarkably similar to the human one, thanks to chlamydia’s tiny, highly 
conserved genome: It has just <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111046/" rel="noopener noreferrer">900</a> active genes, far fewer than most infectious bacteria.</p>
<p>Because of these similarities, the vaccine trials that Endeavour and 
Dr. Timms are running may offer valuable clues for researchers across 
the globe who are developing a human vaccine.</p>
<h2>A riddle, wrapped in a mystery</h2>
<p>How bad is chlamydia in humans? Consider that around one in 10 
sexually active teenagers in the United States is already infected, said
 <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/childrensresearch/directory/toni-darville-md/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Toni Darville</a>,
 chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the 
University of North Carolina. Chlamydia is the most common sexually 
transmitted infection worldwide, with <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-08-2016-growing-antibiotic-resistance-forces-updates-to-recommended-treatment-for-sexually-transmitted-infections" rel="noopener noreferrer">131 million</a> new cases reported each year.</p>
<p>Antibiotics exist, but they are not enough to solve the problem, Dr. 
Darville said. That’s because chlamydia is a “stealth organism,” 
producing few symptoms and often going undetected for years.</p>
<p>“We can screen them all and treat them, but if you don’t get all 
their partners and all their buddies at the other high schools, you have
 a big spring break party and before you know it everybody’s infected 
again,” Dr. Darville said. “So they have this long-term chronic 
smoldering infection, and they don’t even know it. And then when they’re
 28 and they’re like, ‘Oh, I’m ready to have a baby, everything’s a 
mess.’”</p>
<p>In 2019, Dr. Darville and her colleagues <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-05/uonc-uap050919.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">received</a>
 a multiyear, $10.7 million grant from the National Institute of Allergy
 and Infectious Diseases to develop a vaccine. The ideal package would 
combine a chlamydia and gonorrhea vaccine with the HPV vaccine already 
given to most preteenagers. “If we could combine those three, you’d 
basically have a fertility anticancer vaccine,” she said.</p>
<p>Chlamydia’s stealth and ubiquity — the name <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk01tGhqMNQF_Mgxyqx1qjwTpFvbzsg%3A1591192714813&amp;ei=iqzXXoT1MIHm_QaO6ZpA&amp;q=chlamydia+cloak&amp;oq=chlamydia+cloak&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAA6BAgAEEdQ-Q9Y-Q9g2RFoAHABeACAAWeIAWeSAQMwLjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE4qPk5uXpAhUBc98KHY60BggQ4dUDCAw&amp;uact=5" rel="noopener noreferrer">means</a>
 “cloak-like mantle” — owes to its two-stage life cycle. It starts out 
as an elementary body, a spore-like structure that sneaks into cells and
 hides from the body’s immune system. Once inside, it wraps itself in a 
membrane envelope, hijacks the host cell’s machinery and starts pumping 
out copies of itself. These copies either burst out of the cell or are 
released into the bloodstream to continue their journey.</p>

Wildlife Hospital, and a veterinary nurse, Michelle Haywood, examine 
Merlin, a wild koala with a severe case of chlamydia.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Russell Shakespeare for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption><p>“Chlamydia is pretty unique in that regard,” said <a href="https://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/k2.beagley" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ken Beagley</a>,
 a professor of immunology at Queensland University of Technology and a 
former colleague of Dr. Timms. “It’s evolved to survive incredibly well 
in a particular niche, it doesn’t kill its host and the damage it causes
 occurs over quite a long time.”</p>
<p>The bacterium can hang out in the genital tract for months or years, 
wreaking reproductive havoc. Scarring and chronic inflammation can lead 
to infertility, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease. 
Evidence is mounting that chlamydia harms male fertility as well: Dr. 
Beagley <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191009093946.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">has found</a> that the bacteria damages sperm and could lead to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article/102/4/888/5712134" rel="noopener noreferrer">birth abnormalities</a>.</p>
<p>All of this — except the spring break parties — is true in both 
humans and koalas. Researchers who work with both species note that 
koala chlamydia looks strikingly similar to the human version. The main 
difference is severity: In koalas, the bacterium rapidly ascends the 
urogenital tract, and can jump from the reproductive organs to the 
bladder thanks to their anatomical proximity.</p>
<p>These parallels have led Dr. Timms to argue that koalas could serve 
as a “missing link” in the search for a human vaccine. “The koala is 
more than just a fancy animal model,” he said. “It actually is really 
useful for human studies.”</p>
<h2>An ancient curse</h2>
<p>No one knows how or when koalas first got chlamydia. But the curse is at least centuries old.</p>
<p>In 1798, European explorers reached the mountains of New South Wales 
and spied a creature that defied description: ear-tufted and 
spoon-nosed, it peered down stoically from the crooks of towering 
eucalyptus trees. They compared it to the wombat, the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ab4dAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;dq=John+Price+koala+1798&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KxocJBuPln&amp;sig=ACfU3U2_eIrTp_XsyTrU-4R0JUyL8gHohA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjx6sX7ndnpAhWRlXIEHeDuA84Q6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Price%20koala%201798&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">sloth</a>
 and the monkey. They settled on “native bear” and gave it the genus 
name Phascolarctos (from the Greek for “leather pouch” and “bear”), 
spawning the misconception that the koala bear is, in fact, a bear.</p>
<p>“The graveness of the visage,” The Sydney Gazette wrote in 1803, 
“would seem to indicate a more than ordinary portion of animal 
sagacity.”</p>
<p>In the late 19th century, the Australian naturalist Ellis Troughton 
noted that the “quaint and lovable koala” was also particularly 
susceptible to disease. The animals suffered from an eye ailment similar
 to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=RdWg_f5UI7cC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=koala+eye+disease+troughton+ellis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0U2p91a48A&amp;sig=ACfU3U0Mpm5Hs5G263I5uW49Js5cu2oQhg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjH9ca05YvpAhWRYDUKHe0UBqgQ6AEwE3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=koala%20eye%20disease%20troughton%20ellis&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">pink eye</a>,
 which he blamed for waves of koala die-offs in the 1890s and 1900s. At 
the same time, the anatomist J.P. Hill found that koalas from Queensland
 and New South Wales often had ovaries and uteruses <a href="https://archive.org/details/nsquarterlyjourn61comp/page/442/mode/2up" rel="noopener noreferrer">riddled with cysts</a>. Many modern scientists now believe those koalas were probably afflicted with the same scourge: chlamydia.</p>
<p>Koalas today have even more to worry about. Dogs, careless drivers 
and, recently, rampant bushfires have driven their numbers down so far 
that conservation groups are <a href="https://www.ifaw.org/press-releases/bushfires-report-list-koalas-endangered" rel="noopener noreferrer">calling</a>
 for koalas to be listed as endangered. But chlamydia still reigns 
supreme: In parts of Queensland, the heart of the epidemic, the disease 
helped fuel an <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/australia-faces-national-tragedy-over-loss-koala-after-recent-brushfires-180973570/" rel="noopener noreferrer">80 percent decline</a> over two decades.</p>
<p>The disease is also the one that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30381016#:~:text=" rel="noopener noreferrer">most often</a>
 sends koalas to the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, the country’s 
busiest wildlife hospital, located 30 miles north of Endeavour. “The 
figures are 40 percent chlamydia, 30 percent cars, 10 percent dogs,” 
said Dr. Rosemary Booth, the hospital’s director. “And then the rest is 
an interesting assortment of what trouble you can get into when you have
 a small brain and your habitat’s been fragmented.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Image</span></p>
<figcaption><span>Dr. Booth and a colleague inspect Merlin. Chlamydia is
 the most common reason for a koala to visit the hospital. “The figures

said.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Russell Shakespeare for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption><p>Dr.
 Booth’s team treats “chlamydia koalas” with an amped-up regimen of the 
same antibiotics used on humans. “I get all of my chlamydia information 
from the C.D.C.,” she said, referring to the Centers for Disease Control
 and Prevention, in the United States, “because America is the great 
center for chlamydia.”</p>
<p>But the cure can be as deadly as the disease. Deep inside a koala’s 
intestines, an army of bacteria helps the animal subsist off eucalyptus,
 a plant toxic to every other animal. “These are the ultimate example of
 an animal that’s completely dependent on a population of bacteria,” Dr.
 Booth said. Antibiotics extinguish that <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/04/animals-disease-health-koalas-australia/" rel="noopener noreferrer">crucial gut flora</a>, leaving a koala unable to gain nutrients from its food.</p>
<p>In a 2019 <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221109" rel="noopener noreferrer">trial</a>
 led by Dr. Timms and Dr. Booth, one of five koalas treated with 
antibiotics later had to be euthanized “due to gastrointestinal 
complications, resulting in muscle wasting and dehydration.” The problem
 is so dire that vets give antibiotic-treated koalas “poo shakes” — 
fecal transplants, essentially — in the hopes of restoring their 
microbiota.</p>
<p>For the past decade, Dr. Timms has worked to perfect a vaccine. 
Rather than treat animals once they are already sick, a widespread 
vaccine would protect koalas from any future sexual encounter and from 
passing the infection from mother to newborn. His formula, developed 
with Dr. Beagley, appears to work well: Trials have shown that it is <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/03/26/3446643.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">safe to use</a>
 and takes effect within 60 days, and that animals show immune responses
 that span their entire reproductive lives. The next step is optimizing 
it for use in the field.</p>
<p>At Endeavour, the vets treating Jo got a surprise: Molecular tests 
showed she was chlamydia-free. That meant she could be recruited for the
 current trial, which is testing a combined vaccine against chlamydia 
and the koala retrovirus known as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/science/koala-retrovirus-evolution.html">KoRV,</a> a virus in the same family as H.I.V. that similarly knocks down the koala’s immune system and makes chlamydia more deadly.</p>
<p>Dr. Timms is hoping that this trial and another in New South Wales 
will be the “clincher” — the last step before the government rolls out 
mass vaccinations in northern Australia. If he is right, it could be 
good news for more than just koalas.</p>
<h2>Of mice and marsupials</h2>
<p>Dr. Timms began his career studying chlamydia in livestock before 
moving on to using mice as a model for a human vaccine. Cheap, plentiful
 and amenable to genetic manipulation, mice have long been the gold 
standard for studying reproductive disease.</p>
<p>But the mouse model comes with serious drawbacks. Most glaringly, 
mice exhibit a profoundly different immune response to chlamydia than 
ours, making the idea of testing a mouse for a human vaccine “completely
 flawed,” Dr. Timms said.</p>
<p>After a decade of doing mouse work, he reasoned that he could take 
the insights he had gleaned and apply them to an animal that was 
actually suffering and possible to cure: the koala. “We don’t need a 
vaccine for mice,” he said. With “koala work, as hard as that is, and as
 difficult as that is, the results you get are the ones that matter.”</p>
<p>The more Dr. Timms worked with koalas, the more he realized that 
these marsupials were not so different from you and me. Here was a 
species that, like us, was naturally infected with several strains of 
chlamydia and suffered from similar reproductive outcomes, including 
infertility. He realized he might have a useful model animal on his 
hands.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Image</span></p>
<figcaption><span>Merlin receiving antibiotics, the same ones used to 
treat human chlamydia. But the cure can be deadly, extinguishing the 
intestinal bacteria that the animals require to digest eucalyptus, their
 main food source.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Russell Shakespeare for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption><p>“You’re
 better off doing a bad experiment in koalas than a good experiment in 
mice,” Dr. Timms said. “Because koalas really do get chlamydia and they 
really do get reproductive tract disease, so everything you do is 
relevant.”</p>
<p>Outside Australia, many researchers say the idea of a koala model is 
clever but difficult to implement. Dr. Darville pointed out that it 
would be expensive and logistically impossible to test 30 different 
vaccines in koalas. (According to Endeavour, it costs roughly $2,000 to 
pluck one koala from its tree and give it a health exam.)</p>
<p>Still, Dr. Timms said, the challenge was worth attempting: “The 
reason that we’re making a case that in between mouse and humans you 
should put koalas — rather than guinea pigs, minipigs and monkeys — is 
that koalas address all of the weaknesses, to some degree, that the 
others have.”</p>
<p>Paola Massari, an immunologist at Tufts Medical School, is 
collaborating with Dr. Timms to test a different potential vaccine in 
koalas. “The koala represents a perfect clinical model, because it’s an 
animal for which you can do some experimentation that’s a little more 
than what you can do in humans,” she said. “And at the same time, if you
 get results, you are curing a disease (in koalas).”</p>
<h2>An unlikely alliance</h2>
<p>On a hot February afternoon, Dr. Booth strode out into the blaring 
sunlight of the Australia Zoo grounds. She was heading to the chlamydia 
wards, which in 2018 were officially named the John Oliver Koala 
Chlamydia Ward after a grant was donated on the comedian’s behalf. About
 20 sick koalas were being treated with antibiotics that day, with 
dozens more on the road to recovery.</p>
<p>Dr. Booth stepped up to a leafy enclosure, where a fluffy gray female
 eyed her curiously from her perch. This koala was originally brought in
 for chlamydia but had since recovered; her reason for being here, 
listed on her cage, was “misadventure.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Image</span></p>
<figcaption><span>Ms. Haywood carrying Merlin in to the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital on June 24.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Russell Shakespeare for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption><p>“This
 is little Lorna, who’s rather interesting,” Dr. Booth said. “She has a 
baby in her pouch and she’s had problems with her glucose metabolism” — 
she had diabetes.</p>
<p>Wasn’t it unusual to have an animal that gets such humanlike 
diseases: diabetes, cancer and sexually transmitted infections? “We are 
but an animal,” Dr. Booth said, throwing her hands up in a gesture of 
unity with the world. “We didn’t think of it first.”</p>
<p>It is still uncertain to what extent the research on koala chlamydia 
will help in developing a human vaccine. (Dr. Darville had been working 
for nine months when Covid-19 hit, shuttering her lab and slowing 
scientific progress.) What is certain is that the research done on human
 chlamydia has greatly benefited koalas. From human antibiotics to mouse
 insights, wildlife veterinarians have far more tools than before to 
save the vulnerable marsupials.</p>
<p>For Dr. Booth, helping koalas is more than enough. “I don’t want to 
save humans,” she said. “My emphasis is completely the other way: I want
 to use human research to help save other animals. Because they don’t 
have a voice unless we speak for them.”</p>
