<p>WASHINGTON — Republicans are struggling to persuade voters to oppose 
President Biden’s $1.9 trillion economic rescue plan, which enjoys 
strong, bipartisan support nationwide even as it is moving through 
Congress with just Democratic backing.</p>
<p>Democrats who control the House are preparing to approve the package 
by the end of next week, with the Senate aiming to soon follow with its 
own party-line vote before unemployment benefits are set to lapse in 
mid-March. On Friday, the House Budget Committee unveiled the <a href="https://budget.house.gov/sites/democrats.budget.house.gov/files/documents/S%20Con%20Res%205%20Bill%20Final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly 600-page text</a> for the proposal, which includes billions of dollars for unemployment benefits, small businesses and stimulus checks.</p>
<p>Republican leaders, searching for a way to derail the proposal, on 
Friday led a final attempt to tarnish the package, labeling it a “payoff
 to progressives.” The bill, they said, spends too much and includes a 
liberal wish list of programs like aid to state and local governments — 
which they call a “blue state bailout,” though many states facing 
shortfalls are controlled by Republicans — and increased benefits for 
the unemployed, which they argued would discourage people from looking 
for work.</p>
<p>Those attacks have followed weeks of varying Republican objections to
 the package, including warnings that it would do little to help the 
economy recover and grow, that it would add to the federal budget 
deficit and possibly unleash faster inflation, and that Democrats were 
violating Mr. Biden’s calls for “unity” by proceeding without bipartisan
 consensus.</p>
<p>The arguments have so far failed to connect, in part because many of its core provisions poll strongly — even with Republicans.</p>
<p>More than 7 in 10 Americans now back Mr. Biden’s aid package, 
according to new polling from the online research firm SurveyMonkey for 
The New York Times. That includes support from three-quarters of 
independent voters, 2 in 5 Republicans and nearly all Democrats. The 
overall support for the bill is even larger than the substantial 
majority of voters who said in January that they favored an end-of-year 
economic aid bill signed into law by President Donald J. Trump.</p>
<p>While Mr. Biden has encouraged Republican lawmakers to get on board 
with his package, Democrats are moving their bill through Congress using
 a parliamentary process that will allow them to pass it with only 
Democratic votes.</p>
<p>“Critics say my plan is too big, that it cost $1.9 trillion dollars; 
that’s too much,” Mr. Biden said at an event on Friday. “Let me ask 
them, what would they have me cut?”</p>
<p>House Republican leaders on Friday urged their rank-and-file members 
to vote against the plan, billing it as Speaker Nancy Pelosi of 
California’s “Payoff to Progressives Act.” They detailed more than a 
dozen objections to the bill, including “a third round of stimulus 
checks costing more than $422 billion, which will include households 
that have experienced little or no financial loss during the pandemic.” 
Ms. Pelosi’s office issued its own rebuttal soon after, declaring 
“Americans need help. House Republicans don’t care.”</p>
<p>Republicans have also railed against the process Democrats have 
employed to advance the bill, citing dozens of legislative amendments 
that Republicans offered in various committees, which Democrats 
rejected. Last week, top Republican senators complained in a letter to 
Democratic committee leadership about plans to bypass Senate hearings on
 the House bill, describing it as “the outsourcing of their own 
committee gavels to the House.”</p>
<p>The Republican pushback is complicated by the pandemic’s ongoing 
economic pain, with millions of Americans still out of work and the 
recovery slowing. It is also hampered by the fact that many of the 
lawmakers objecting to Mr. Biden’s proposals supported similar 
provisions, including direct checks to individuals, when Mr. Trump was 
president.</p>

<p>“What they’ve tried to do is pick apart individual pieces of it,” 
Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in an interview. 
“But I think on an overall basis, you have to contrast that with how 
well this is being received across the country.”</p>
<p>Some Republican lawmakers and aides acknowledge the challenge they 
face in trying to explain to voters why they object to the package, 
particularly after reaching agreement with Democrats on several rounds 
of aid earlier in the crisis. Many of those negotiations were 
contentious and stretched for months; Mr. Biden has said he will not 
wait for Republicans to join his effort, citing the urgency of the 
economy’s needs.</p>
<p>“We’ve shown over five different bills we can do it together,” said 
Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia and one of the
 lawmakers who had met privately with Mr. Biden to discuss both economic
 relief and infrastructure plans. “I think we’re going to have to draw a
 contrast of what’s in there and does not make sense.”</p>
<p>While explaining their opposition to voters would be a challenge, she
 said, supporting the bill is not an option for most Republicans.</p>
<p>“The price tag in the end is just so inordinately high and has too 
many extraneous things in it to gain any real support in the Republican 
Party.”</p>
<p>The scattershot critique is a contrast from the last time a president
 used the parliamentary move, called budget reconciliation, to push a 
major proposal: the $1.5 trillion tax cut package that Mr. Trump and 
congressional Republicans passed in 2017 without any Democratic votes. 
Shortly before the first House hearing on the tax cuts, Democrats on the
 Ways and Means Committee made a plan to brand the bill as a “tax scam” 
benefiting the rich and the powerful, before Republicans could sell it 
as a boon to the middle class.</p>

 Trump’s tax cuts took a hit in public polling, and they gave little 
boost to Republican candidates in the 2018 midterm elections that 
followed. Republicans have found similar success in recent years driving
 the popularity of signature legislation under Democratic presidents, 
most notably President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act in 2010.</p>
<p>Representative Donald S. Beyer Jr., Democrat of Virginia, recalled 
the warning he heard from leaders in his party in 2017: “Republicans are
 great at talking in headlines, and we’re great at talking in fine 
print.” Democrats’ ability to pick a pithy message and stick with it in 
the tax debate, he said, was “one of the few times we ran against type.”</p>
<p>Many Republicans remain confident that their attacks will begin to 
resonate in this debate. One senior Republican aide, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said that with attention focused on the 
legislation this week, members would continue to highlight provisions 
that are seen as longtime liberal priorities, as well as the money left 
over from previous relief packages. Republicans also plan to question 
whether the new funds would deliver on promises to improve the economy 
and reopen schools.</p>
<p>“I think we do have an obligation to ask questions,” said 
Representative Tom Reed of New York, one of the moderate Republicans who
 initially spoke with White House officials in a bid to reach a 
compromise. He predicted that once voters focused on individual 
provisions that demonstrated the package’s largess and overreach, they 
would sour on the overall proposal.</p>
<p>“It’s human nature, and I get it, but can we try to move forward in a
 much more productive manner?” Mr. Reed added, echoing the process 
complaints already percolating among Republicans in both chambers.</p>
<p>Polls suggest that could be a tough fight for Republicans, as many of
 the bill’s provisions are widely popular. In the SurveyMonkey poll, 4 
in 5 respondents said it was important for the relief bill to include 
$1,400 direct checks, including nearly 7 in 10 Republicans. A similarly 
large group of respondents said it was important to include aid to state
 and local governments and money for vaccine deployment.</p>
<p>They split evenly on the question of whether they are more concerned 
that the plan is too big, further driving up the federal budget deficit,
 or too small, and thus unable to quickly spur economic growth.</p>
<p>The fractured debate over the plan in and outside of Washington has 
also been largely overshadowed by the tumult within the Republican Party
 itself, where the specter of Mr. Trump and his impeachment over the 
Jan. 6 Capitol attack looms large and threatens to continue upending 
efforts to focus on conservative efforts to frame the legislation as 
overreaching and ineffective. (Mr. Trump, as recently as this week, was 
hammering Republicans for an unwillingness to accept direct payments.)</p>
<p>Given their slim majority in the House and the strict parameters that
 allow them to avoid the filibuster in the Senate, Democrats can afford 
few, if any, defections in order to send the legislation to Mr. Biden’s 
desk before unemployment benefits begin to lapse in March.</p>
