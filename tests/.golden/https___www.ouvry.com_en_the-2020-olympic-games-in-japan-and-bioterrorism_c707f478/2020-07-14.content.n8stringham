        </head><body><article><p>In a mini-review published in “ADC 
Letters for infectious disease control”, Eto A. and Kanatani Y. explain 
how Japan is preparing for a possible bioterrorist attack. The strategy 
to make Japan “the safest country in the world” is based on a “Sakigake”
 pilot project to promote the development of innovative drugs and other 
medical devices. The strengthening of medical countermeasures to fight 
the natural outbreak of epidemics also implies increased surveillance of
 bioterrorism and therefore the use of therapeutic or prophylactic 
agents against the germs of bioterrorism, which are more rarely 
encountered, and it is also an opportunity for us to make a clear 
distinction between a natural epidemic and an epidemic caused by a 
bioterrorist act.</p>
<p>Japan and bioterrorism</p>
<p>In 1993, eight years before the anthrax envelopes attacks in the 
United States, the Aum sect had sprayed Bacillus anthracis spores from 
the roof of a building in Kameido near Tokyo. Only the terrible smell 
had caught the attention of the residents. There were no victims and it 
was only in the early 2000s that environmental samples revealed the 
presence of the pathogenic strain. Twenty years have passed: large-scale
 bioterrorist attacks are rare and peacetime must therefore be used to 
develop medical countermeasures specifically for bioterrorism.</p>
<p>What is bioterrorism?</p>
<p>It is the intentional spread of biological agents (viruses, bacteria, fungi and toxins).</p>
<p>The characteristics of epidemics following bioterrorism are as follows:</p>
<p>+ contamination caused by a single exposure to biological agents can 
be detected in different places because of the latency period between 
the dispersion of the agent and the infection itself;</p>
<p>+ the disease declared can be different according to the individual’s
 health status and in particular their immune status vis-à-vis the 
agent;</p>
<p>+ the number of patients can increase according to secondary infections;</p>
<p>+ the distinction between natural infection and infection due to bioterrorism can sometimes be very difficult to demonstrate ;</p>
<p>+ there are sometimes prophylactic drugs and/or vaccines ;</p>
<p>+ the risk of the appearance of germs with increased virulence 
(infectivity, antibiotic resistance…) by using new molecular biology 
tools is not zero (Crispr/Cas9).</p>
<p>All these points must be taken into account when strengthening medical countermeasures specific to bioterrorism.</p>
<p>Overview of medical countermeasures against bioterrorism</p>
<p>The effort focuses mainly on germs classified “A” by the CDC of 
Atlanta: easy spread, easy-to-transmit from person to person, high 
mortality, major impact on the health of the population, massive 
disruption of public structures due to panic and disruptions in the 
social structure. The most monitored germs of this class A are: Bacillus
 anthracis (anthrax disease), Yersinia pestis (Plague), Francisella 
tularensis (Tularemia), smallpox virus, haemorrhagic fever virus (Lassa,
 Ebola…), botulinum toxin (from Clostridum botulinum).Since the events 
of 2001, the Japanese government has done a lot of work in the field of 
CBRN: development of vaccines, coordination between the structures 
responsible for bioterrorism follow-up (administrations, first aid, 
coastguards, etc., and medical authorities), strict management of 
biological and chemical products involved in CBRN.</p>
<p>Responses</p>
<p>The usual monitoring of the occurrence of natural epidemics should be
 extended to the detection of bioterrorism. Detection is fundamental: 
the abnormal increase in suspicious cases is a warning sign: infections 
are very well monitored by practitioners who report the information to a
 specialized agency. When an outbreak is suspected, an epidemiological 
investigation is quickly initiated in order to identify the germ 
involved as quickly as possible. New identification methods such as mass
 spectroscopy (TOF-MS) are also being tested. This rapid identification 
will allow prophylactic and/or curative measures to be implemented under
 the best possible conditions.</p>
<p>The challenges of counter-bioterrorism</p>
<p>If Japan has purchased a smallpox vaccine, it should be noted that, 
in general, the production of vaccines and other medicines to build up 
stocks is not sufficient. Moreover, as these events are relatively rare,
 the manufacture and testing of products for medical countermeasures 
cannot be carried out under the same conditions as for conventional 
pharmaceutical products.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>As the 2020 Olympic Games are being prepared, bioterrorism is 
becoming more and more prominent. The social repercussions and disorders
 caused by such an event would be very significant. The use of medical 
countermeasures for infectious diseases would be able to mitigate their 
harmful consequences. Better public health monitoring and rapid and 
reliable diagnosis of the germs involved, including their resistance to 
antibiotics, must be developed in microbiology laboratories. The 
challenges of developing vaccines and drugs (antibacterials, 
antivirals…) for these rare events are very important.</p>
