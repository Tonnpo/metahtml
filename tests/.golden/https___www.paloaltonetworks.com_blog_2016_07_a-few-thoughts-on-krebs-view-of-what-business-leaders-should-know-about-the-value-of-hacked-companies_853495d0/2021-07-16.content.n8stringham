<p>Over the past several years, we have seen cybersecurity increasingly become a boardroom issue. A report sponsored by <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2015/10/all-eyes-on-the-boardroom/">Palo Alto Networks, Forbes, Financial Services Roundtable and Georgia Tech</a>
 in 2015 showed that the number of boards paying attention to 
cybersecurity has risen 33 percent since 2012. But, as Brian Krebs 
recently noted in his interesting blog post on <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/the-value-of-a-hacked-company/" rel="nofollow,noopener">The Value of a Hacked Company</a>, senior execs should think a little deeper about the business impact of cyber incidents.</p>
<p>To highlight his point, Krebs turns the classic, "damage to business 
reputation” argument on its head and has built a helpful diagram showing
 how an attacker would look at the value of a company’s data. Economic 
motivation can be a powerful incentive for criminal hackers, and the 
thinking is that senior leaders should know what an attacker is most 
interested in as this is the same data that they likely value and should
 focus on protecting. However, one key aspect that Krebs’ model can dig 
deeper into is the externality costs from attackers looking to swim 
upstream into a company to achieve broader downstream effects. Think 
targeting one company in order to hit their clients. This style of 
attack has been a concern for<a href="http://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2014/08/law_firms_not_doing.html" rel="nofollow,noopener"> law firms</a> worried about protecting their clients’ sensitive files; the <a href="https://www.opm.gov/cybersecurity/cybersecurity-incidents/" rel="nofollow,noopener">government protecting employee records</a>; and, for industrial control systems and the internet of things <a href="https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/Monitors/ICS-CERT_Monitor_May-Jun2016_S508C.pdf" rel="nofollow,noopener">vendors attached to critical infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p>As we have seen with <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/solutions/initiatives/ransomware">ransomware</a>, criminal attackers are becoming much more efficient with their economic models for making serious cash. With last year’s <a href="http://cyberthreatalliance.org/cryptowall-report.pdf" rel="nofollow,noopener">takedown of CryptoWall v3</a>, members of the <a href="http://cyberthreatalliance.org/" rel="nofollow,noopener">Cyber Threat Alliance</a> discovered over $325 million in damages from this one campaign. Attackers are also highly sensitive to their profit model. A <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2016/02/for-cyberattackers-time-is-the-enemy/">recent Ponemon survey</a>
 noted that not only are a majority of attackers financially motivated, 
but also that a two-day increase in their workload is enough to dissuade
 them from continuing an attack.</p>
<p>What does all this mean for CEOs and board members? Unfortunately, to
 Krebs' point, it shows that adversaries likely understand the value of 
your data and how to access it better than you do. It also shows that 
business-savvy attackers driven by profit motive will look for 
opportunities to strike once and reap the benefits from large amounts of
 data. For a company, this generally means attackers will target data 
that you are holding on behalf of someone else or systems that are 
connected to many other targets. From a business risk standpoint, this 
blows your externality cost models out of the water.</p>
<p>The recent attacks utilizing the SWIFT global payment system are 
another excellent example. In this case, attackers appeared to be 
leveraging the trust in the SWIFT network not to take it down or gain 
sensitive IP but to use it as a conduit for perpetrating fraudulent 
transactions against other users. This hammers home that, even if you 
are the first victim of an attack, you may not be the primary victim but
 could still be potentially responsible. This has been a major concern 
in the cyber insurance market as well, where the complexity of these 
types of externality costs make it difficult to write policies that 
cover the full cost of major cyber incidents.</p>
<p>With all this being said, there is hope! Krebs ends with a pitch for 
an effort that is near and dear to my heart: the Cybersecurity Framework
 that was launched in a public-private partnership by the U.S. 
government and private sector in 2014. The Framework emphasizes that 
investments made against your specific business risks can have a huge 
effect on increasing your cybersecurity. From a Palo Alto Networks 
perspective, we speak about this as focusing on preventing successful 
attacks by matching your investments to the right personnel training, 
proper security processes, and next-generation technology, in order to 
raise the cost for attackers at every step in the attack lifecycle. This
 strategic level of planning for prevention rests largely in the hands 
of senior leaders, and oversight of these risk reduction measures is 
becoming a key board responsibility as well.</p>
<p>Kudos to Krebs for helping to generate discussion and build out more 
data around bringing cyber to the boardroom. For more information on how
 to plan for, prevent and respond to cyberattacks, check out some of the
 great articles from our partners at the <a href="https://www.securityroundtable.org/" rel="nofollow,noopener">SecurityRoundtable.org</a>.</p>
