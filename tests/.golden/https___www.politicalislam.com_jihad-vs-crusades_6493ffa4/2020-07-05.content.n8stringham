<p>Whenever you’re dealing with an apologist for Islam, or even a 
Muslim, and you bring up jihad, almost immediately, they kickback to 
you: “But what about those terrible crusades? Why they’re the moral 
justification for jihad and we’re just as bad as they are. So let’s not 
talk about jihad, okay? Let’s talk about the Crusades.”</p>
<p>Well, what I would like to talk about here, are facts. I created a 
database of 548 battles that Islam fought: jihad battles against 
classical civilization. This isn’t even all the battles. It doesn’t 
include battles Africa, India, Afghanistan and other locations. It’s 
primarily at data base of the battles against the classical civilization
 of Rome and Greece.</p>
<p>548 battles are a lot; too many to comprehend. So I created a dynamic
 battle map with displays of the Mediterranean in 20 year increments. On
 the display, a white dot designates a battle during the twenty-year 
period, a new battle. Every time the screen changes to the next 20 year 
period, the previous white dots turn red and a new set of current 
battles are shown with white dots so you can see the unfolding history. 
This may seem a little confusing, but when you see it you’ll know 
exactly what I mean.</p>
<p>As the dynamic display starts, Islam bursts out of the Arabian 
Peninsula and immediately starts attacking the Middle East. Notice that 
it is not long before there are battles across the Mediterranean and 
attacks in southern France, and Spain.</p>
<p>Notice something else: when most people think of Islam, they think of
 Arabs; and of desert. Yet here we see that Islam is projecting power 
throughout the Mediterranean. Notice how the little islands of the 
Mediterranean are getting hammered. The navy of Islam would attack 
coastal towns, kill, rob, rape, and then take slaves. As this entire 
battle map unfolds, slaves are taken. Over a million slaves were taken 
from of Europe into the Islamic world. It’s something you don’t think 
about, but it’s absolutely true.</p>
<p>There were over 200 battles fought in Spain alone. We also see, 
however, on the east coast, in Turkey, that Islamic forces attempt to 
break into Europe. What happens in Spain during this ongoing fight that 
lasted for 400 years is that the Christians push back the Moslems. But 
what happens in the East is that Constantinople falls and now then 
eastern Europe gets hammered. The jihad comes to Eastern Europe. It’s 
pushed out of Spain, but northern Africa becomes completely Islamic, and
 the Middle East is completely Islamic.</p>
<p>This is all jihad, relentless jihad. And why is it so relentless?</p>
<p>Well, Mohammed was relentless in his jihad, and these people are good
 students of Islam. And so it’s jihad against the Kafir, endlessly.</p>
<p>It was traditional that when a new Sultan came to power, he would 
immediately attempt to launch new wars because he would be noted in 
Islamic history as to how well he fought against the Kafir.</p>
<p>So that’s what the jihad looked like over that time period: 548 
battles. But remember, when you bring up jihad, people want to bring up 
the Crusades. So I also prepared a dynamic battle map of all the 
offensive raids of the crusaders. Let’s watch it and make a comparison.</p>
<p>As it begins, the Crusades enter Turkey and the Middle East; battles 
ensue. But there are far fewer than you might think. And in short order,
 the map concludes. The last battles are fought and the Crusades are 
over.</p>
<p>Now we can talk about some facts! Yes, there were Crusades. But 
notice that they ended centuries ago, and jihad is still being practiced
 today. Jihad has been with us for 1400 years. There is no comparison 
between jihad and the Crusades; certainly not a moral comparison. And 
when you’re looking at the Crusades, remember, in one sense the Crusades
 were defensive wars. Why? As we saw in the first jihad map, it was 
Islam that came out of Arabia and conquered the Middle East, a Christian
 Middle East. The crusaders were trying to free their Christian brothers
 and sisters from jihad. So there’s no moral comparison all. The 
motivation of the crusaders was to free Christians; the purpose of jihad
 was, and still is, to enslave the Kafir.</p>
<p>So, the next time you hear somebody talk about “those dreadful 
Crusades”, respond to the facts of the matter. Speak up and tell that 
person, “You don’t really know the facts!”</p>
