<p>These figures are a rough estimate of the death of non-Muslims by the political act of jihad.</p>
<p>Africa</p>
<p> Thomas Sowell [Thomas Sowell, Race and Culture, BasicBooks, 1994, p.
 188] estimates that 11 million slaves were shipped across the Atlantic 
and 14 million were sent to the Islamic nations of North Africa and the 
Middle East. For every slave captured many others died. Estimates of 
this collateral damage vary. The renowned missionary David Livingstone 
estimated that for every slave who reached a plantation, five others 
were killed in the initial raid or died of illness and privation on the 
forced march.[Woman’s Presbyterian Board of Missions, David Livingstone,
 p. 62, 1888] Those who were left behind were the very young, the weak, 
the sick and the old. These soon died since the main providers had been 
killed or enslaved. So, for 25 million slaves delivered to the market, 
we have an estimated death of about 120 million people. Islam ran the 
wholesale slave trade in Africa.</p>
<p> 120 million Africans</p>
<p>Christians</p>
<p> The number of Christians martyred by Islam is 9 million [David B. 
Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30-AD 2200, William 
Carey Library, 2001, p. 230, table 4-10] . A rough estimate by Raphael 
Moore in History of Asia Minor is that another 50 million died in wars 
by jihad. So counting the million African Christians killed in the 20th 
century we have:</p>
<p> 60 million Christians</p>
<p>Hindus</p>
<p> Koenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million
 Hindus killed in the total jihad against India. [Koenard Elst, 
Negationism in India, Voice of India, New Delhi, 2002, pg. 34.] The 
country of India today is only half the size of ancient India, due to 
jihad. The mountains near India are called the Hindu Kush, meaning the 
“funeral pyre of the Hindus.”</p>
<p> 80 million Hindus</p>
<p>Buddhists</p>
<p> Buddhists do not keep up with the history of war. Keep in mind that 
in jihad only Christians and Jews were allowed to survive as dhimmis 
(servants to Islam) everyone else had to convert or die. Jihad killed 
the Buddhists in Turkey, Afghanistan, along the Silk Route, and in 
India. The total is roughly 10 million. [David B. Barrett, Todd M. 
Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30-AD 2200, William Carey Library, 
2001, p. 230, table 4-1.] 10 million Buddhists</p>
<p>Jews</p>
<p> Oddly enough there were not enough Jews killed in jihad to 
significantly affect the totals of the Great Annihilation. The jihad in 
Arabia was 100 percent effective, but the numbers were in the thousands,
 not millions. After that, the Jews submitted and became the dhimmis 
(servants and second class citizens) of Islam and did not have 
geographic political power.</p>
<p>This gives a rough estimate of 270 million killed by jihad.</p>
