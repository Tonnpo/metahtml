<p>It’s time for free-market capitalism to reclaim its legacy as a 
creator of prosperity — not just for citizens of the Western world, but 
for people everywhere. It’s not capitalism that has to justify itself; 
it’s everything else. Why? Because everything else has resulted only in 
poverty. Does that surprise you? Are you skeptical? Andy Puzder, author 
of “The Capitalist Comeback,” has the charts and data to prove it.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">When countries embrace the free market, their 
economies markedly improve, as demonstrated by British economist Angus 
Maddison. Western Europe’s GDP per capita increased dramatically during 
the industrial revolution, then even more sharply in the decades after 
World War II when it fully embraced the free market. Japan’s GDP per 
capita likewise rose sharply after WWII as the U.S. helped the Japanese 
transition to a democracy and a free market capitalist economy. Eastern 
Europe took off after it was released from the Soviet Union and 
socialism in 1991. China did likewise after it shifted away from strict 
socialism and implemented some limited free market policies. </p>

 themselves out of extreme poverty, and the global poverty rate is now 
lower than it has ever been in recorded history. This is one of the 
greatest human achievements of our time,” said World Bank Group

<p class="">Take a close look at this…Jonathan Haidt, the noted New York
 University psychologist, calls it "the most important graph in the 
world." </p>
<p class="">Why does he say that?</p>
<p class="">Because he knows this graph reveals a simple, inescapable 
fact: there is no substitute for free market capitalism as a promoter of
 human prosperity. </p>
<p class=""> Let it be noted that Haidt is no one’s idea of a 
conservative. But when hard evidence stares him in the face, he’s not 
going to look away. </p>
<p class="">The graph is based on the research conducted by the late 
British economist, Angus Maddison. The numbers along the X-axis are 
years—two thousand of them. The numbers on the Y-axis are dollars—all of
 them, divided by the number of people on the planet. It’s what’s called
 GDP per capita, which is the world’s economic output divided by its 
population. GDP is considered the best measurement of a country's 
standard of living. And, in this case, the world’s standard of living.</p>
<p class="">Often when I show this graph to students, I get this 
comment: “That’s not capitalism; it’s just the impact of the Industrial 
Revolution.” </p>
<p class="">So I show them another chart by the Maddison Project. This 
one breaks the GDP hockey stick into regions. As you can see, there are a
 number of hockey sticks. But note that they don’t rise at the same 
time. The United States surged first.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p> Well, in a very fortuitous coincidence, the year 1776 witnessed both
 the signing of our Declaration of Independence and the publication of a
 book called The Wealth of Nations by the Scottish economist and 
philosopher, Adam Smith. In his book, Smith explained how to create a 
modern free market capitalist economy and the benefits of doing so. </p>
<p> America’s wise founders took Smith’s principles to heart, and within
 a mere 100 years—the blink of an eye historically—capitalism turned the
 United States from thirteen backwoods colonies into the world’s largest
 economy. And it has held that position ever since. </p>
<p>Western Europe shot up as well, but later. It rose steadily during 
the Industrial Revolution and then experienced a sharp rise after World 
War II when, between the end of the war and the mid-1960s, it fully 
embraced the free market. </p>
<p> Japan, too, shot up after World War II—surpassing Western Europe for
 the first time after the US helped the Japanese transition to a 
democracy and a free market capitalist economy.</p>
<p> Eastern Europe took off after it was released from the Soviet Union and socialism in 1991.</p>
<p> China did likewise after the Chinese moved away from strict 
socialism and implemented some limited free market policies. One can 
only imagine where China would be now if its leaders had fully unleashed
 the forces of the free market. </p>
<p>Yes—during this period of economic expansion, the wealthy got 
wealthier. That always happens when new wealth is created. But the 
middle class and the poor also greatly benefited.</p>
<p>Here’s another telling chart. This one is from the World Bank. In 
1820, 94% of people lived in extreme poverty. Thanks to capitalism, by 
2015 that number had declined to 9.6%—single digits for the first time 
in human history. Now, it’s still too many, but if we are going to 
reduce the number even more, we need to understand what caused the 
decline: free market capitalism.</p>
<p> If we combine the Angus Maddison hockey stick chart and the World 
Bank data on extreme poverty, what we get is something quite amazing: 
unprecedented global prosperity and an unprecedented decline in poverty 
across the globe over the past 200 years. That’s capitalism in a 
nutshell. </p>
<p>One more chart: Johan Norberg, a Swedish economic historian, shows us
 how well ordinary people do when they work in a free market economy. </p>
<p>Since 1990, hunger, poverty, illiteracy and child mortality have all 
declined significantly with the decline of socialism. This all happened 
while we added two billion more people to the world. Far more people; 
far less poverty. Better health outcomes; fewer babies dying. That’s 
what economic freedom—capitalism—can do. </p>
<p> President John Kennedy, a Democrat, said it best while making his 
case for significant tax cuts in 1963. He said, “A rising tide lifts all
 boats.” Kennedy didn’t believe that the poor only get richer when the 
rich get poorer. He believed everyone could get richer with economic 
growth. History has shown that he was right. </p>
<p> This whole capitalism vs. socialism debate is backwards:</p>
<p>It’s not those who advocate for free market capitalism who need to 
justify their actions. Rather, it’s those advocating for socialism—or 
any form of it—who have a lot of explaining to do. </p>
