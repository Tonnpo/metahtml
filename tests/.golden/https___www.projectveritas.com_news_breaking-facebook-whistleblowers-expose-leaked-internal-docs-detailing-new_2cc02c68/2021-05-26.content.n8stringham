<p>[Westchester, NY – May 24, 2021] Two Facebook Insiders have come 
forward to Project Veritas with leaked internal documents, showing the 
Big Tech giant’s plan to police “Vaccine Hesitancy” (VH) through 
surreptitious “comment demotion.” </p>
<p>The company has set up a tier system to rank comments on various 
scales, based on how much the statement questions or cautions against 
the Covid-19 vaccination. </p>
<p>Tier 2, for instance, represents “Indirect Discouragement” of getting
 vaccinated and according to PV’s sources, user comments such as these 
would be heavily “suppressed.” </p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if the comments are true, factual or represent 
reality. The comment is demoted, buried and hidden from view of the 
public if it clashes with this system. </p>
<p>“It doesn’t match the narrative,” one insider explained. “The 
narrative being, get the vaccine, the vaccine is good for you. Everyone 
should get it. And if you don’t, you will be singled out,” </p>
<p>One of the insiders, a Data Center Technician, leaked multiple 
internal documents detailing an algorithm test being run on 1.5 percent 
of Facebook and Instagram’s nearly 3.8 billion users worldwide. </p>
<p>The goal? To, “drastically reduce user exposure to vaccine hesitancy (VH) in comments.”</p>
<p>“They're trying to control this content before it even makes it onto your page before you even see it,” one insider said. </p>
<h4>1. The authors of the plan are credited as Joo Ho Yeo, Nick Gibian, Hendrick Townley, Amit Bahl and Matt Gilles. </h4>
<h4>2. The goal of the “framework” is to “identify and tier the 
categories” of content that “could discourage vaccination in certain 
contexts.” </h4>
<h4>3. Facebook also established a “Vaccine Hesitancy” scoring system to establish numerical thresholds for certain content. </h4>
<h4>4. The company instituted tiers to describe the tone of certain 
posts, with some being categorized as “sensational/alarmist” or 
“criticizing choice.” The responses range from outright removal to 
comment demotions. </h4>

discusses more data points following the “experiment” with “demoting” VH
 comments. </h4>
<h4>6. One part of the document admits to “demoting” comments and 
reducing the rate of likes while conducting a test of 1.5 percent of the
 company’s audience. </h4>
<h4>7. Other posts discussing the unique double dose of certain vaccines
 were described as “objective_high” and outlined a “position change.” </h4>
<h4>8. Descriptions of the type of content that falls into Tier 0, Tier 1 and Tier 2.</h4>
<h4>9. An enforcement document obtained by one of the Insiders showed 
Facebook’s goal of reducing the distribution of comments seemingly 
skeptical of Covid vaccination. </h4>
<h4>10. Facebook document details how many languages their "Vax Safety" policy will be able to detect for suppression. </h4>
<h4>11. Facebook's "Vaccine Hesitancy" project leaders listed in company's chain of command, reporting directly to Mark Zuckerberg.</h4>
