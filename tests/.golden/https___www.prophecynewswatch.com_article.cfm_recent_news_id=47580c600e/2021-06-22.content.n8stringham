<h1 class="rm-manual">The Terror Attack Which Galvanised the Temple Mount Movement</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>By Pastor Enoch</span> </p>

<p>October 29th, 2014 was just another day in the life of Jerusalem 
Rabbi and Temple Mount Activist Yehudah Glick. The soft spoken 
red-headed Rabbi described by some as 'the most dangerous man in the 
Middle East' had just finished giving a public lecture on "The 
Importance of Maintaining a Jewish Presence on the Temple Mount and was 
packing his bags into the boot of his car while his wife was waiting 
patiently in the passenger seat. </p>
<p>Suddenly a man on a motorcycle pulled over and asked in heavily 
accented Hebrew: 'Are you Yehudah Glick?". "Yes", affirmed Yehudah while
 his wife casually listened on from inside the car.</p>
<p>"I am terribly sorry," the man on the motorcycle continued with anger
 rising in his voice, "but you are an enemy of al-Aqsa". With that the 
man pulled a gun and fired four rapid shots at point blank rage into 
Yehudahs unprotected chest before speeding off on the motorbike.</p>
<p>We will hear more of what happened to Rabbi Glick later in this 
article. While this attack was intended to spell the end for the Temple 
restoration movement, we will see how it actually ended up galvanising 
the movement across Israel. We will also see the significance of this 
movement in light of Bible Prophecy and the end times.</p>
<p>Rebuilding the Temple A Dream of the Minority</p>
<p>A few years ago, I attended a lecture by a practicing Jew who is a 
leader within the Zionist community. During the Q&amp;A after the 
lecture, a keen Christian took note of the leaders obvious faith in the 
God of Israel and asked him about his thoughts on rebuilding the Temple.
 His response which took several of us Christians by surprise - was to 
explain that he was not at all interested in the rebuilding of the 
Temple. </p>
<p>He went on to explain how he viewed the sacrificial system as 
something quaint and irrelevant nowadays and that he was glad to leave 
it in the dustbin of history.</p>
<p>While many Christian students of Bible Prophecy are very excited 
about the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple as setting the stage for End 
Time events, I have learned to my surprise that only a minority of 
Religious Jews share this interest. </p>
<p>After the destruction of the second temple by the Romans, Judaism 
adapted itself to a religion no longer dependent upon sacrifices for 
forgiveness of sin, but one that encouraged good works as a path to a 
right standing with God. While the site of the ancient Temple remains 
revered across the spectrum of Judaism, the concept of rebuilding the 
temple now remains a controversial dream of a small minority.</p>
<p>Fears of an International Backlash</p>
<p>Apart from a lack of religiously motivated enthusiasm to rebuild the 
Temple, another dampening factor is the reality that any such moves 
would be likely to trigger off an immediate World War 3. As many of you 
would know, the Temple Mount is today occupied by the third holiest site
 in Islam, namely the Al Aqsa Mosque and the picturesque Dome of the 
Rock. </p>
<p>Any action that appears to threaten the sanctity of these sites will 
draw the immediate wrath of the Islamic world. Highlighting the level of
 Islamic concern for this site, the Organisation of Islamic Co-Operation
 was founded in 1969 specifically with the goal to protect the Al-Aqsa 
mosque. Today this influential organisation boasts 56 member states and 
is the second largest intergovernmental organisation in the world.</p>
<p>With such a huge body of nations dead-set against any strengthened 
Jewish presence on the Temple Mount, and being a fringe view within 
Judaism, Temple Mount Activists have been seen by many Israelis as 
irresponsible trouble makers who need to be kept in check to avoid a 
major international conflict.</p>
<p>Will there be a Third Temple?</p>
<p>In light of the above, it would seem unlikely that the Temple could 
be rebuilt in this age. In fact, successive Israeli governments have 
firmly and repeatedly committed themselves to maintaining the status quo
 on the Temple Mount to avoid fermenting trouble.</p>
<p>However, New Testament and Old Testament prophecies about the End of 
Days assume the presence of the Temple. For example, Jesus (Mt. 24:15) 
and Paul (2 Thes. 2:3-4) prophesied an End Time defilement of the 
Temple. Although some may argue that this refers to a 'spiritual temple'
 (i.e the church), it is clear that these predictions would have been 
understood by their original listeners as referring to the literal 
building itself. Other predictions such as Daniels mention of the daily 
sacrifices being taken away are also best understood to refer to a 
literal Temple.</p>
<p>The restoration of Israel after 1900 years of exile was unlikely, yet
 happened in accordance with many prophecies throughout the Bible. In 
the same way, the rebuilding of the Temple appears unlikely, but if Gods
 Word is telling us that it will happen, then we can expect it to take 
place.</p>
<p>Do we see evidence today that we are nearing the time when the Temple
 might be rebuilt? Lets return to Yehudah Glicks story to see what has 
happened since the attack on his life.</p>
<p>Returning to Yehudah Glick</p>
<p>On October 22, doctors at the Shaarei Tzedek Medical Centre in 
Jerusalem worked frantically to save the life of a bullet riddled 
terrorist. One nurse openly questioned why they should work so hard to 
save the life of a man who had just killed three innocent civilians, but
 the rest of the team responded that they were simply doing their job.</p>
<p>A week later to the day1, the same team were set to work on Rabbi 
Glick, and lessons learned from the week before helped them give Yehudah
 the best possible treatment as he was hovering between life and death. 
Many prayers were being lifted up for Rabbi Glick and his survival and 
subsequent recovery has been described by many as nothing short of 
miraculous. </p>
<p>The doctors who operated on him reported that none of the bullets 
left serious lasting damage one bullet hit his spine without touching 
the spinal cord, while another bullet went through his neck passing 
within millimetres of a major artery.</p>
<p>Being released from hospital less than a month later, a pale looking 
Yehudah Glick held a press conference where he praised the God who 
raises the dead. A year later, in commemoration of the event that had 
almost snuffed out his life, a re-vitalised Yehudah Glick returned to 
the scene of his attempted assassination and danced so vigorously that 
younger men might have had trouble keeping up with him.</p>
<p>The Revitalised Temple Mount Movement</p>
<p>Before the assassination attempt, Rabbi Glick was a fringe activist 
mainly known within the ideological right. The attack became headline 
news across Israel, and he quickly become a household name. As his fame 
grew, new supporters were added to the cause including a new youth 
movement.</p>
<p>Yehudah was subsequently interviewed by many media outlets including 
the BBC. Within four months of the attack, a general election was held 
in Israel and Rabbi Glick ran for election as a candidate for Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahus party2. He was listed way down on the 
ballot list and did not succeed in entering the Knesset. Since then, his
 profile has continued to rise and later reports are now saying that he 
is a certainty to enter the Knesset at the next election.</p>
<p>Yehudah has high ranking supporters within Netanyahus party, and was 
in August granted his first one-on-one audience with Netanyahu. During 
the half an hour meeting, Netanyahu reportedly expressed warmth, 
understanding and sympathy for Glicks cause.</p>
<p>While Yehudah Glick is rising in the corridors of power, the Temple 
Mount Institute of which he is a part is continuing preparations 
training young priests believed to be descendants of the Priestly line 
in performing the ancient sacrifices and preparing the holy vessels for 
the day when the Temple is rebuilt.</p>
<p>It appears that the terror attack that was meant for evil has 
strengthened the Temple Mount movement and may indeed be a sign that we 
are getting closer to the End Times and ultimately to the Coming of Our 
Lord.</p>
<p>There are significant inter-faith developments taking place that are 
of concern from a Christian perspective, but that may fit in with the 
end time scenario. Despite his controversial views regarding the Temple 
Mount, Yehudah Glick has been actively involved in interfaith dialogue 
and believes that the Temple should be a house of prayer for all 
nations. In August 2015, 8 months after the attempt on his life, Glick 
was invited to Turkey to be the guest of honour at a Ramadan celebration
 attended by 1000 Muslim Clerics. </p>
<p>The event was arranged by popular Turkish Muslim writer Adnan Oktar, 
who has publically called for the rebuilding of the Jewish temple. While
 many Bible-believing Christians and orthodox Jews disagree that the 
Temple worship could in any way be shared with the Islamic faith, Glick 
is open to the idea. It is interesting in this context that Revelation 
11:1-2 describe the outer court of the Temple as being given to the 
gentiles, perhaps indicating some kind of shared arrangements on the 
Temple Mount as envisaged by Glick and certain Muslim leaders.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>There remain many hindrances to the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple. 
Despite the progress made so far, the majority of religious Jews still 
oppose it and it remains strongly opposed by most of the Islamic world. 
It would require nothing short of a miracle for these sentiments to 
shift enough to allow for the rebuilding of the Temple. </p>
<p>However, just as the restoration of the nation of Israel seemed 
unlikely during her 1900 years of exile, God has a way of fulfilling 
what He has repeatedly promised throughout the Scriptures. Our God is in
 complete control of world events and is setting the stage for the End 
Time events of Scripture. Now is the time for us as believers to live 
whole-heartedly for God, to make sure our own Temples are in order and 
to pray for our loved ones to be in right relationship with God.</p>
