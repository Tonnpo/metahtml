<p class="">“Well, I have no children — that is, no heirs,” he said in

<p>Hershey died in 1945, leaving a huge estate and a company that would 
grow to sell more than 250 million candy bars a year. His generosity, 
however, has created a dilemma for the Milton Hershey School that many 
charities would envy: too much money.</p>
<p>Over the years, board members who control Hershey’s estate invested 
in land, stocks and bonds. They helped transform Hershey’s company town 
into a tourist destination, complete with hotels, amusement-park rides, 
golf courses and a conference center — all now part of the school’s 
endowment, which includes a controlling stake in the chocolate company.</p>
<p>Federal tax law does not mandate that organizations like the Milton 
Hershey School spend a particular amount each year on their charitable 
mission. But the widening chasm between what the school could spend to 
help poor children and what it actually spends has led alumni, a local 
probate judge and the state attorney general to call for the institution
 to do more.</p>
<p>Hershey’s fortune, which funds the school, has ballooned to be larger
 than that of the Ford Foundation. But the school has faced persistent 
criticism for helping only a fraction of the vulnerable children it 
could reach with its vast wealth. New questions have arisen over its 
spending after a former board chair sued in early April for access to 
financial documents he says he’s been denied for more than a year.</p>
<p>Located on a sprawling, leafy campus abutting farmland in Hershey, 
Pennsylvania, the nation’s wealthiest school serves roughly 2,100 
students from low-income families. Founded as an orphanage where boys 
earned their keep working on Hershey’s dairy farms, the school now 
boasts rigorous academics and extensive support services, and most of 
its students go on to college.</p>
<figcaption> <span>A view of the central Pennsylvania campus of the nation’s wealthiest school, the Milton Hershey School.</span> <span> <span>Credit: </span> Dan Gleiter/PennLive.com </span> </figcaption><p>In
 1999, enrollment at the school was roughly the same as it had been in 
the 1950s. Between 1999 and 2019, the number of students doubled. But 
over the same period, the school’s endowment increased nearly fourfold 
and is now worth more than $17 billion.</p>
<p>John Kinnaird, a 1949 graduate of the school who spent time with 
Milton Hershey over dinners as a student, said the businessman would 
have wanted his charity to spend more. “His heart was to provide for 
orphans,” he said.</p>
<p>The charity’s board members say they are doing what Hershey wanted. 
Beginning in 1909, Milton Hershey put his estate into the Milton Hershey
 School Trust, the legal entity that exists solely to hold the Hershey 
estate and to fund the school. Board members say they are bound by the 
school’s founding document, the original deed signed by Hershey and his 
wife, Catherine. To ensure that the school will exist “in perpetuity,” 
the deed says the board can spend only the income earned by the 
endowment, not the endowment itself. So while the school’s total assets 
are worth $17.4 billion, $16 billion of that — Hershey Co. stock, real 
estate holdings and other investments — cannot be spent, according to 
the deed.</p>
<p>Even with that constraint, however, the school hasn’t been as generous as it could be.</p>
<p>The Inquirer, Spotlight PA and ProPublica have spent the past year 
examining the Hershey Trust and Milton Hershey School — their structure,
 their spending and the education the school provides. The news 
organizations found that in most years since its founding, the Hershey 
fortune has generated more income than the school has spent. As early as
 1934, Fortune magazine noted the “embarrassingly large surplus piling 
up in the school’s coffers.” By 2020, the unspent income had grown to 
more than $1 billion, even as the school spends roughly $90,000 per 
student a year.</p>
<p>The Hersheys gave the school’s board of directors the power to admit 
more students as more income poured in. (As the deed put it: “From time 
to time, as there may be vacancies, or increased ability from income may
 warrant, others shall be admitted.”)</p>
<p>But, crucially, they left the specifics of how many students to 
admit, and how much income would warrant an expansion, up to the board 
members. Still, in a 1999 ruling, a state judge wrote that the Hersheys’
 intentions were clear: “to care for as many children at the School as 
the income will permit.”</p>
<p>Administrators say the school plans to grow to 2,300 students over 
the next few years. And last September, under pressure from the state 
attorney general to spend some of the money that has piled up, the 
charity announced that it would use $350 million to create a network of 
six preschools across Pennsylvania, calling the project perhaps the 
“largest private commitment of its kind to early childhood education.”</p>
<p>Twice in the past decade, the charity, whose board members are paid 
at least $110,000 a year, has been investigated by the state attorney 
general, who was looking into whether its spending was sufficiently 
helping kids; both times, the charity reached settlement agreements 
ending the probes and leading to reforms.</p>
<p>Enrollment Growing, but Assets Growing Faster</p>
<p>Enrollment at the Milton Hershey School has nearly doubled since 
2000, with the number of students reaching an all-time high of 2,189 in 
2019, but the value of the school’s assets has nearly quadrupled in the 
same time, growing from $4.5 billion to $17.4 billion.</p>
<p>In early April, former board chair Robert Heist sued for access to 
financial records that he said school officials had withheld for more 
than a year. Heist, who still sits on the board, said he needed the 
documents to ensure that school funds were not wasted. The school claims
 in court documents that Heist’s requests “represent a fishing 
expedition”; the suit is ongoing. Heist said in a court filing on Monday
 that he seeks the documents to “better understand how millions of 
dollars could not be budgeted or accounted for annually while relating 
to ‘school operations.’”</p>

<p>As a charity, the Milton Hershey School doesn’t pay federal or state 
income taxes. In exchange for those big savings, the school is expected 
to serve the public good through its stated purpose: housing and 
educating low-income and at-risk children.</p>
<p>“The tax breaks are intended to support efforts in the public good 
and it’s not for the accumulation of wealth, particularly at this 
historic moment when the needs are so great,” said Mae Quinn, a 
professor at the University of the District of Columbia’s law school who
 has written about wealth accumulation at elite private colleges.</p>
<p>“We are constantly growing our program and seeking ways to support 
more children from poverty and do it better everyday,” Milton Hershey 
school spokesperson Lisa Scullin said in a statement. “The deed also 
requires the school to be funded forever,” she said, adding that 
“prudent management is what ensures that will happen.”</p>
<h3> Restrictions in the Deed Can Be Changed </h3>
<figcaption> <span>The Milton Hershey School board cites restrictions in
 its founding deed as the reason it can't spend more of its funds. But 
in 1976, the school acknowledged in a legal document that the deed had 
in fact been changed multiple times.</span> <span> <span>Credit: </span> Source: Milton Hershey School second restated deed of trust </span> </figcaption><p>Hershey
 board members say that, when it comes to spending more, their hands are
 tied by the restrictions in the original deed, particularly the 
requirement that they spend only the income from Milton Hershey’s 
fortune — rents, interest and stock dividends — not the estate itself.</p>
<p>But the deed’s restrictions can be, and have been, loosened. Since 
the school’s founding, and even during Milton Hershey’s lifetime, board 
members have eliminated or rewritten parts of the deed.</p>
<p>For instance, the deed originally said that income from the school’s 
endowment could only be spent on the school itself. But in 1963, board 
members decided there was too much unspent income and sought to divert 
$50 million to build a hospital on land owned by the estate and used by 
the school. A change like this requires a legal process known as 
cy-pres, where a trust asks the county probate court for permission to 
alter the terms of its deed while sticking as closely as possible to its
 founders’ intentions.</p>
<p>The court approved, and construction began on the hospital. Some 
older alumni of the school are still bitter about that decision, 
believing it was improper, since Hershey intended his gift to fund only 
the school for orphans, not other interests.</p>
<p>In 1970, the charity again sought and received court approval to 
change the terms of the deed, this time lifting its requirement that 
admission to the school be limited to “white male orphans.” Several 
years later, the deed was changed once more to let girls in, as well as 
children from disadvantaged backgrounds, not just orphans.</p>
<p>And, in yet another change, the charity won court approval last year 
for its plan to build and run the six preschool centers across the 
state, breaking for the first time with the deed’s insistence that the 
school must be “permanently located” in Derry Township, Pennsylvania, 
which includes the town of Hershey.</p>
<p>The move came after prodding from Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh 
Shapiro, who said in court that addressing the school’s “significant 
accumulated income” was at the top of his agenda when he took office in 
2017.</p>
<p>The preschool project, which will take five years to complete, 
represents a major expansion for the charity — the first time in its 
112-year history it will serve poor children without requiring them to 
live in the Hershey area and the first time it will reach children under
 the age of four. When they’re up and running, the preschools will cost 
roughly $55 million a year to operate.</p>
<p>Even so, the initial $350 million phase of the project will use up 
only a fraction of the $1.2 billion in unspent income that has already 
accumulated.</p>
<p>And as part of the preschool initiative, in a move that was approved 
by the court, the charity will designate almost $900 million as 
emergency reserves — enough to cover 2.7 years of operating expenses for
 the Milton Hershey School. Experts say nonprofits typically only keep 
about a year of expenses in reserve.</p>
<p>By reclassifying the roughly $900 million as a rainy day fund, the charity made it unavailable for a broader expansion.</p>
<p>Laura Otten, the executive director of The Nonprofit Center at La 
Salle University, said nonprofits’ reserves typically hold three months 
to one year of operating costs. “Some say the max should never be more 
than two years. I’ve yet to meet a nonprofit that has two years’ worth 
of reserves,” she said.</p>
<p>But Scullin, the school spokesperson, said, “Given that the school 
has a single source of revenue that must exist in perpetuity, it is both
 common practice and prudent policy to establish a reserve policy.”</p>
<h3> A New Law Allows for More Spending </h3>
<figcaption> <span>Milton Hershey and the early students of the school that bears his name in 1913.</span> <span> <span>Credit: </span> Source: Milton Hershey School </span> </figcaption><p>When
 the Milton Hershey School was founded, in the early 20th century, it 
was common for trusts and foundations to limit their charitable spending
 to the traditional income generated by their endowments.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1970s, though, leaders of college endowments and nonprofits sought looser rules and more investing flexibility.</p>
<p>To free up these charitable resources, Pennsylvania lawmakers passed a
 law in 1998 that allows nonprofits and charitable trusts to spend more 
each year by adopting a broader definition of “income.” Under the new 
law, charities and nonprofits could choose to spend anywhere from 2% to 
7% of the entire market value of their assets, averaged over at least 
three years. Board members could simply vote to change their policy and 
keep “permanent records” of the decision. Court approval was not 
required.</p>
<p>A year later, in 1999, the Hershey charity appeared poised to take 
advantage of the new law. Robert Vowler, then a charity board member and
 president of the Hershey Trust Co. that administers the Hershey estate,
 testified in court that board members had chosen an annual spending 
rate of 3% of the school’s assets. “The legislation is very good,” he 
said. “It allows us to view the whole portfolio.”</p>
<p>Missed Opportunity</p>
<p>Since 2002, the Milton Hershey School has spent on average about 2.2%
 of the charity’s assets each year — nearly $4 billion — educating 
low-income and at-risk children at its boarding school in Pennsylvania. 
In 1999, after a change in state law, the president of the bank that 
administers the Hershey estate, who was also a charity board member, 
told a probate judge that increasing spending to 3% of the school’s 
assets was reasonable. If this spend rate had actually been used, the 
boarding school could have benefited from an additional $1.3 billion 
since 2002.</p>
<p>But the board did not adopt the policy. If it had, the school could 
be spending much more — an extra $166 million in 2019 alone. Vowler did 
not return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>The news organizations’ analysis of 20 years of tax documents found 
that the charity spends, on average, 2.2% of its total wealth each year 
to run the school. By contrast, endowments, foundations and nonprofits —
 which aren’t limited to spending only their traditional income — 
typically spend between 4% and 5% of their assets each year, studies 
show.</p>
<p>Using the 1998 law, other Pennsylvania charities have been able to 
spend a greater percentage of their assets. The legacy trusts 
administered by the Philadelphia Foundation, for example, spend 5% 
annually, based on the average value of the trust assets over five 
years, said Pedro Ramos, foundation president and CEO —even trusts that 
were originally limited to spending only their income.</p>
<p>Shapiro, the state attorney general, said through a spokesperson that
 it’s up to the Hershey charity to decide whether to take advantage of 
the 1998 law, called Act 141. At the same time, the attorney general’s 
office said that there is no reason the charity could not change its 
policy under the law, and that it continues “to push for the trust to 
invest more resources in Pennsylvania children.”</p>
<p>At 99 years old, Ken Brady is one of the oldest surviving graduates 
of the Hershey Industrial School, as the school was originally known. He
 and his two brothers enrolled in December 1929, after their father 
died. Brady got to know Milton Hershey over dinner at one of the 
school’s farm homes and while doing chores in the barn. When Brady 
graduated in June 1940, Hershey personally handed him his diploma.</p>

 says he’s grateful the school rescued him and gave him a future — 
that’s why he’s disturbed by its reluctance to take full advantage of 
Hershey’s gift. </p>
<p>“Mr. Hershey took care of me,” he said. “I feel an obligation that other children should have the same opportunity that I had.” </p>
<p>He believes Hershey would have wanted the school to serve as many 
children as possible. “Seventeen billion dollars? You should have 
thousands and thousands of kids.”</p>
