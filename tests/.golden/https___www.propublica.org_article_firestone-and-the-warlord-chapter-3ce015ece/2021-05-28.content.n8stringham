<figcaption class="rm-manual"><span>(Matt Rota for ProPublica)</span></figcaption><p><span>A</span>fter
 chasing the Firestone managers out in June 1990, Taylor took over the 
colonnaded grandeur of House 53. The message was unmistakable: The 
company that had dominated the country for so long, that held power over
 its leaders and its laborers, had been vanquished. </p>
<p>The stately mansion was often chaotic and frenzied. Cronies and 
bodyguards lounged in the hallways. Sycophants waited for an audience. 
Battle commanders rushed in and out.</p>
<p>Taylor’s goal was to seize Monrovia, which held half the country’s 
population, most of its major financial and political institutions and 
most important, the executive mansion – Doe’s presidential residence, a 
menacing, fortified structure overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The easy answer for Firestone would have been to just say, ‘We're out of here.’</p>
<p> Gerald Padmore, former consultant for Firestone </p>
<p>Taylor staged his attack from the Firestone plantation. He was 
confident enough of his success that he announced he would occupy the 
mansion by early July.</p>
<p>His men battled to within 500 yards of the executive mansion where 
Doe had holed up with his men. That was as far as he would get. As the 
two sides traded mortar- and small-arms fire, Taylor suddenly called a 
halt to the operation. The United States had reached out to him to plead
 for peace.</p>
<p>Cohen, the State Department’s top Africa hand, talked with Taylor 
several times by satellite phone to negotiate a ceasefire. He even 
visited Taylor at a rearguard base in Ivory Coast, where he found Taylor
 seated on a throne, surrounded by child soldiers. Behind him was a 
portrait of President John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline.</p>
<p>“He had visions of being a great statesman,” Cohen said. “He saw 
himself like that. ‘I’m gonna take over Liberia and make it into a new 
country.’ ”</p>
<p>The bid for peace failed, and Liberia faded further as a concern for 
the United States. Cohen said his superiors made that clear to him.</p>
<p>“The feeling was that we didn’t want to have Liberia as our adopted 
child,” Cohen said. “We were not going to take charge of Liberia.”</p>
<p>Into the void stepped an alliance of West African nations led by 
Nigeria, the regional heavyweight. In August 1990, the alliance deployed
 some 7,000 peacekeepers, known as ECOMOG.</p>
<p>The peacekeepers succeeded in halting Taylor. But they did not save 
Liberia’s president. Doe was captured and killed by the head of a rival 
rebel faction led by Prince Johnson, one of Taylor’s former generals.</p>
<figcaption>Fighting in the streets of Monrovia. <span>(Patrick Robert/Sygma/Corbis)</span></figcaption><p>A notorious, vicious drunk, Johnson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaLSzjfyUiA">had himself filmed</a>
 as he ordered his men to torture Doe. While he sat behind a desk with 
two open cans of Budweiser beer, a young woman fanning him from behind, 
Johnson ordered his men to strip Doe. The portly president kneeled 
before Johnson in his underwear, quivering, sobbing, begging. Johnson’s 
men hacked off his ears. Blood poured down his torso. Doe’s body was 
later found dumped outside a medical clinic.</p>
<p>Amos Sawyer, a Liberian intellectual, would emerge as the president 
of an interim government named at a meeting of leading Liberian 
politicians, activists and religious leaders.</p>
<p>By November, an uneasy ceasefire had settled across the country. Liberians called it “no peace, no war.”</p>
<p>Taylor, unimpressed by the peacekeepers and the new interim president, went about the business of governing.</p>
<p>He now controlled almost all of Liberia. In typically grandiose 
fashion, Taylor named his territory Greater Liberia — though it was 
better known by its eponymous nickname, Taylorland. He declared himself 
president.</p>
<p>As his capital, he chose the village of Gbarnga in the flatlands of northern Liberia, a scruffy regional trading center. </p>
<figcaption>Children too young to carry rifles were often given grenades. <span>(Patrick Robert/Sygma/Corbis)</span></figcaption><p>Taylor
 turned a long, low single-story house on an airy hill overlooking the 
village into his executive mansion. From the outside, it was modest and 
unpretentious. Inside was rococo furniture and walls of varnished wood.</p>
<p>He formed a legislative body for Taylorland, the National Patriotic 
Reconstruction Assembly Government, or NPRAG. He appointed a Cabinet of 
ministers (frequently fired, sometimes beaten) and created a judicial 
system (hardly independent). He even hired a lobbyist in Washington, 
D.C.</p>
<p>He also built his army — eventually amassing perhaps 10,000 fighters 
and child soldiers armed with machine guns, mortars and artillery 
cannon.</p>
<p>His dreams stretched wide as Liberia’s sky.</p>
<p>“I’m not a soldier. I’m an economist. I came here believing in the 
very democratic principles that the United States is built on today,” he
 told television cameras. “All I want to do is to bring back some 
sanity, some fair play in the country.”</p>
<p>For a while, a group of Firestone’s Liberian managers worked with 
Taylor to run the plantation. But they couldn’t maintain the millions of
 rubber trees. They had no ships to transport the rubber, no sales 
network to sell it. The farm’s hydroelectric plant supplied electricity 
only haphazardly.</p>
<p>By February 1991, the plantation was in danger of falling apart. A 
group of former Firestone workers met Taylor on the veranda of House 53.
 Their message: They wanted Firestone back. </p>
<p>“The employees were not benefiting,” said Victor Bestman, the 
Liberian estates manager. Taylor’s associates “sold the rubber, enriched
 themselves and how they divided it nobody knows.”</p>
<p>Taylor grew to realize that he needed Firestone. Symbolically, the 
company’s return would amount to a bright neon sign indicating that 
Taylorland was open for business. Politically, its jobs and supplies of 
food would ensure that residents did not rise up in dissent.</p>
<p>“We needed Firestone to keep people busy,” Richardson said.</p>
<p>When Firestone abandoned Liberia, it made Taylor seethe.</p>
<p>“There’s a little war, and then you run off, and there’s no food, no 
medicine, complete breakdown,” Taylor would later tell one Firestone 
executive at a meeting. “That’s inexcusable.”</p>
<p>For its own part, Firestone was in no mood to kowtow to a guerrilla 
leader who had threatened its managers and killed its workers. </p>
<p>In October 1990, Ensminger sent a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310625-ex88.html#document/p1/a187547">brusque letter</a>
 addressing Taylor as “Commander-in-Chief” — not President. He requested
 a meeting, and a guarantee that the Firestone personnel who attended 
the meeting would be safe. A week later, Ensminger sent a follow-up <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1362152-01-letterfromdonaldensmingertocharlestaylor.html">aide memoire</a> – a term typically used in diplomatic circles to outline discussion points. </p>
<figcaption>Donald Ensminger, then the general manager of the Firestone plantation, said he tried to take a hard line against Taylor. <span>(Ott Gang/The Akron Beacon Journal)</span></figcaption><p>In
 it, Ensminger laid out Firestone’s conditions for returning to Liberia.
 At the top of the list: Firestone “cannot resume operations unless its 
employees, both Liberian and expatriate, have sufficient assurances that
 peace, law and order will be restored in Liberia to ensure their own 
safety and that of the members of their families from physical harm.”</p>
<p>Ensminger demanded better financial terms to lower the company’s tax 
liabilities. And he noted that Firestone would not recognize the 
“legitimacy” of any political or military authority so as to avoid 
“interfering in the internal affairs of Liberia.”</p>
<p> “The existing situation raises questions as to whether, when and how operations could be resumed in Liberia,” Ensminger wrote.</p>
<p>Today, Ensminger said he thought the company should not have attempted to negotiate with Taylor.</p>
<p>“Taylor was not a recognized government of Liberia. There was no 
reason or legality for negotiation with Taylor,” Ensminger said in the 
interview. “It was only that we were trying to figure out a way to get 
to the plantation and resume operations.”</p>
<p>The missive did little to improve Taylor’s disposition.</p>
<p>Ensminger’s attitude was, “ ‘We want our plantation back. You have no
 business there. We want everything. Our trucks back. We want this, that
 and everything else,’ ” said Richardson, Taylor’s adviser. </p>
<p>Taylor was prepared to wait. If Firestone wanted its rubber plantation back, it would have to bend – and pay.</p>
<h3>The Investment</h3>
<p>Back in Akron, Ensminger and other managers began strategizing about how to get the plantation running again.</p>
<p>In 1988, the Japanese tire conglomerate Bridgestone had acquired 
Firestone for $2.65 billion — the largest purchase of a U.S. company by a
 Japanese one at the time. </p>
<p>Business analysts judged the deal a disaster. Bridgestone moved too 
slowly to make necessary cuts. The company hemorrhaged money. Between 
1990 and 1992, the new U.S. subsidiary, called Bridgestone/Firestone, 
lost $1 billion, according to one history of the company. </p>
<p>On Bridgestone’s balance sheet, Firestone’s Liberian plantation 
wasn’t a large item, generating about $104 million in revenue and $15.6 
million in profits in 1989, the year before the civil war. But the 15 
percent profit margin the plantation achieved that year was a bright 
spot on a corporate ledger drowning in red ink.</p>
<p>Top managers “were under a lot of pressure from Akron to get the 
plantation going,” said Ken Gerhart, the Firestone manager who ran the 
company’s soda bottling plant in Monrovia. The plantation “was very, 
very profitable. It was very efficient.”</p>
<p>The company found alternative sources of rubber in Asia after the 
plantation’s abandonment, but the latex produced in Liberia was 
considered to be among the finest in the world, in part because of the 
company’s tight quality control. The plantation supplied about 40 
percent of the U.S. market for latex, and 10 percent of the world 
market. </p>
<p>The value of the plantation itself – the land, the trees, the 
factories, buildings, vehicles and equipment – was estimated at nearly 
$200 million. If Firestone pulled out for good, those assets would be 
unsalvageable. Even a temporary interruption posed risks: There was no 
assurance that Liberia would allow the company back, especially under 
the favorable conditions of the original deal cut in 1926.</p>
<p>To figure out how to deal with Taylor and return to Liberia, 
Firestone hired a young Liberian-born lawyer with impressive 
credentials. Gerald Padmore had graduated from Yale and then Harvard Law
 School. He had returned to Liberia to serve in President Tolbert’s 
government. As the acting minister of finance, he sat across the table 
from Firestone in rubber contract negotiations.</p>
<p>Later, he switched to Firestone’s side and began advising company 
leaders on whether to return to Liberia. Firestone agreed to have 
Padmore answer questions for the company about events in the early 
1990s.</p>
<figcaption>Families were often short of food during Liberia's years of internal strife. <span>(Patrick Robert/Sygma/Corbis)</span></figcaption><p>“It
 was a real dilemma for the company,” Padmore said. There was “a lot of,
 I would say, soul-searching, and really tough, tough decision-making 
that had to be done.”</p>
<p>As Padmore saw it, there were two competing governments in Liberia, 
neither of which had been formally recognized by the United States. 
Firestone’s operations straddled the lines of control. The plantation 
sat in Taylorland. But the company shipped its rubber and latex from 
Monrovia. To move from the plantation to the port, company employees had
 to pass through numerous roadblocks and withstand entreaties for bribes
 at each stop. Who made the rules? Who got the company’s taxes? </p>
<p>Padmore said much of Firestone’s determination to return to Liberia 
was driven by concern for its Liberian workforce. Firestone had stopped 
making rice shipments to the plantation in June 1990, and so men, women 
and children were surviving on sugar cane and rotting bananas. During 
one period that fall, the company’s medical director was recording 10 to
 15 deaths a day, according to a sworn deposition. </p>
<p>The plantation and its trees were also a worry. Rubber trees must be 
very carefully tended and harvested to prevent them from dying. 
Firestone had received word that Liberians had descended on the 
plantation to illegally harvest latex from the company’s trees. They 
were “slaughter tapping” — an industry term for extracting so much sap 
that the tree dies.</p>
<p>“We’re hearing stories from our employees that they’re distressed,” 
Padmore recalled. “We’re hearing stories that our assets are being 
looted or destroyed. It’s a question of do we abandon Liberia, as many 
other major businesses had done, or will there be a future, and how do 
we get back on?”</p>
<p>Padmore said the “easy answer” for Firestone would have been to 
abandon the plantation. Several companies fled Liberia at the start of 
the war. Others had chosen to stay, according to a State department 
cable. </p>
<p>Padmore said it was tempting for Firestone to say, “ ‘We’re out of 
here. It’s risky. It’s scary. Economically, it doesn’t make any sense.’ ”</p>
<p>“In a sense, that would have been morally satisfying, that you could 
safely be back in the United States. But if you felt a sense of 
responsibility to Liberia, and, most importantly, to the workers, your 
teammates, really, the people you’ve worked with for years, who were 
distressed—some of them were killed—you’d say, ‘Well, let’s go back and 
see if we can help them,’” Padmore continued.</p>
<figcaption>The raw latex that helped build an empire. <span>(From the American Geographical Society Library, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries)</span></figcaption><p>“I
 think those were all good decisions, because, for me, Liberia outlasts 
the temporary rulers it may have. It’s a country. It’s ordinary people 
whose lives are terribly important. They don’t have the ability or the 
means, as I fortunately did, to fly off to the United States and be 
safe. They’ve got to worry about their kids. For me, it’s the right 
choice. Stay as long as you can,” Padmore said.</p>
<p>Padmore acknowledged that Firestone’s employees had experienced 
Taylor’s violence. His soldiers had threatened Ensminger. Gerhart was 
put on a hit list, and his personal driver had the soles of his feet cut
 off with machetes by Taylor’s men. Firestone expats witnessed Taylor’s 
fighters savaging people in Harbel.</p>
<p>“We knew there had been fighting, there had been killing, and there 
had been some ethnic reprisal killings,” Padmore said. “But at that 
time, from the information available to me, and, I think, to Firestone, 
Taylor did not appear to be conducting genocidal activities.”</p>
<p>In the interview, Ensminger said that was “laughable.”</p>
<p>“Firestone knew full well and was getting reports from the State 
Department and from the ambassador and from Liberians,” he said. “They 
knew full well that atrocities and human rights violations were 
committed.”</p>
<p>In October 1990, Human Rights Watch <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1362171-dos-1991-may17-monrov-04137.html#document/p5/a187252">reported</a>
 that Taylor soldiers had committed widespread killing and torture. 
Two-thirds of Doe’s tribe, the Krahn, had fled the country. Those who 
remained, the report said, were “at risk of genocide.”</p>
<p>In early 1991, the U.S. State Department released its report on human
 rights violations in 1990, a congressionally-mandated assessment for 
every country in the world. For Liberia, it read like a gore novel.</p>
<p>All the warring factions, including government soldiers, had 
committed atrocities. Each time Taylor took over a new province, his 
forces hunted and killed hundreds of men, women and children from the 
Mandingo and Krahn ethnic groups, which were seen as sympathetic to Doe.
 Emergency food centers set up to feed starving Liberians became 
grotesque snares. Those in line were forced to produce identity cards. 
The Krahn were killed. In one particularly nasty practice, Taylor’s men 
set up a highway checkpoint called “No Return.” More than 2,000 people 
were killed there.</p>
<p>“The overall human rights situation in Liberia in 1990 was appalling,” <a href="https://archive.org/stream/countryreportson1990unit%22%20%5Cl%20%22page/192/mode/2up">the report read</a>. “All combatants routinely engaged in indiscriminate killing and abuse of civilians, looting, and ethnically based executions.”</p>
<p>“Leaders of all the armed groups did little or nothing to stop the killings </p>
<p>and, in some cases, may have encouraged them or been directly responsible for the abuses.”</p>
<p>Official data, painstakingly compiled years later by Liberia’s Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission from the testimony of thousands of 
Liberians, attempted to quantify the human damage. By December 1990, 
Taylor’s forces alone had committed nearly 40,000 human rights 
violations. The toll included more than 6,400 killings, 800 kidnappings 
and 600 rapes, according to a ProPublica analysis of the data.</p>
<figcaption>Mary Pollee's family was decimated by both government and rebel forces. <span>(Ashley Gilbertson for ProPublica)</span></figcaption><p>Mary
 Pollee said she was one victim of Taylor’s fighters. From the Firestone
 plantation, she fled to a city held by Taylor’s rebels. The fighters 
stole her food. They took her clothes. They threatened her with guns. 
And then one day, they grabbed her 13-year-old daughter and raped and 
killed her.</p>
<p>Pollee — her husband, a son, and a daughter now buried — went mad.</p>
<p> “I was like somebody going crazy,” said Pollee. She began weeping at
 the memory in her living room, the cicadas outside whirring, the sun 
beating. “I was not to myself, oh.”</p>
<p>In Ohio, Firestone executives continued to discuss what to do. 
Initially, they decided to wait to see if the conflict would resolve 
itself. But as those hopes faded, Firestone made its final decision. </p>
<p>The company would go back to Liberia. </p>
<p>“Completely justifiable,” Padmore called the decision.</p>
<p>“Had I had a crystal ball and an ability to say that’s going to 
happen, I would have told Firestone in January of 1992, ‘Don’t go back,’
 but we didn’t know that would happen. We were hopeful that good things 
were going to happen.”</p>
<p>He added: “Had [Firestone executives] not taken those decisions, I think Liberia would be much the worse for it today.”</p>
<h3>America Works for Firestone</h3>
<p>In February 1991, Ensminger flew to Liberia to reach out to Taylor. 
Over the coming months, the company resumed feeding its workers. It <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1362158-07-letterfromjohnrvispotoministernmornorkonmana.html#document/p1/a187549">sent shipment</a>s of rice to Taylor and to the interim government. It even <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1362158-07-letterfromjohnrvispotoministernmornorkonmana.html">hired Taylor forces</a> to guard House 53.</p>
<p>Taylor ignored the entreaties.</p>
<p>Said Richardson: “They just wanted what’s for Firestone to be for Firestone.”</p>
<figcaption>John T. Richardson was one of Taylor's top aides.<span>(FRONTLINE)</span></figcaption><p>In April 1991, U.S. Ambassador <a href="https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/de-vos-peter-john">Peter Jon de Vos</a> secured a meeting with Taylor in Gbarnga. He invited Ensminger along for the journey.</p>
<p>De Vos was a proponent of Firestone and Taylor reaching an accommodation. After the meeting, a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/apzunhuvwx003z2/DOS_1991_April09_Monrov_02977.pdf?dl=0">cable</a> noted that “De Vos pressed Taylor” to talk with Firestone officials.</p>
<p>“We are encouraging (Taylor Labor Minister Nyundeh) Monkonmlah and 
Firestone to reach accommodation since inactivity at the plantation 
benefits no one,” one embassy official wrote <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1362171-dos-1991-may17-monrov-04137.html">in another cable</a>.</p>
<p>A news broadcast from the time showed that the meeting disintegrated 
quickly. With cameras rolling, Taylor received De Vos in an anteroom 
furnished with a gilded white and gold Louis XV couch and chairs covered
 in plastic. Dark wood paneling rose above red carpet. Impeccable, 
Taylor wore a dark suit, with a white pocket square and red tie. </p>
<p>De Vos, dressed in a rumpled suit and bow tie, and large, square 
glasses, was sweating profusely. He greeted Taylor. Then, he introduced 
Ensminger, tan, fit and mustachioed.</p>
<p>“This is Mr. Ensminger, the director general of Firestone,” De Vos said.</p>
<p>Taylor looked puzzled. “Oh, he works for the embassy now?”</p>
<p>“No, America works for him,” De Vos replied.</p>
<p>Firestone knew full well and was getting reports from the State 
Department and from the ambassador and from Liberians. They knew full 
well that atrocities and human rights violations were committed.</p>
<p> Donald Ensminger, general manager for the Firestone plantation </p>
<p>Within minutes, Taylor began to harangue Ensminger. He questioned why
 Firestone was using the port in Monrovia rather than the port that he 
controlled.</p>
<p> “My biggest problem with Firestone is that instead of trying to play
 economic games, they’ve been trying to play political games,” Taylor 
told the U.S. ambassador at one point. </p>
<p>The camera panned to Ensminger. He sat silently. He wore a tight smile on his face. </p>
<p>In behind-the-scenes talks, Richardson discussed matters directly 
with Ensminger. Richardson recalled asking Ensminger to provide back pay
 to the workers. Richardson said Ensminger denied the request.</p>
<p> “He was a very arrogant son of whatever,” Richardson said.</p>
<p>Ensminger told a different story. He said that he and his team had 
repeatedly tried and failed to meet with Taylor. The reason? Taylor’s 
ministers demanded a bribe even to see the guerilla leader.</p>
<p>“They wanted money before they would talk to us,” he said.</p>
<p>Ensminger said he refused to pay.</p>
<p>“Look we are a concessionaire of the country of Liberia. We’ve been 
here for many years. We’ve operated and made taxes and given every other
 means of support that’s legal,” he said he told the rebels. “Now you 
come in and try to take over the government and want us to recognize you
 and receive all the dues that a government should receive. If that 
happens, we’ll be glad to work with you. But that hasn’t happened.”</p>
