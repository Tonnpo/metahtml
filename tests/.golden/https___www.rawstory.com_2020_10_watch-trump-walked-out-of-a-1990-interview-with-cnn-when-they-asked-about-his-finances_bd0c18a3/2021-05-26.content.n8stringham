<p class="rm-manual"> <span>October 27, 2020</span> </p>
<p>Long before he became the president, Donald Trump was a business tycoon who had trouble holding onto his money.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html" rel="noopener">New York Times reporting</a>
 on the president's personal income tax records has shown, Trump 
throughout his career would frequently burn through money at a stunning 
rate throughout the 1990s, at one point reporting adjusted gross losses 
of nearly $1 billion per year in 1994 and 1995.</p>
<p>The tax records obtained by the Times show that things really started
 going downhill for Trump in 1990, when he reported a gross net loss of 
$400 million.</p>
<p>That very same year, the future president would conduct a contentious
 interview with CNN reporter Charles Feldman in which he'd eventually 
walk off after being questioned about his finances.</p>
<p>In a clip of the interview posted by CNN's Andrew Kaczynski, Trump 
can be seen ranting to Feldman that libel laws are too protective of the
 media before going on to criticize him for purportedly "inaccurate" 
reporting.</p>
<p>"What was inaccurate so far?" Feldman asked.</p>
<p>"I thought your demeanor was inaccurate," Trump responded. "I thought
 that questions you were posing to people in my organization were false 
and unfair."</p>
<p>"Questions, by definition, can't be inaccurate," the reporter shot back.</p>
<p>Feldman then quoted some chatter he'd heard from multiple financial 
analysts questioning whether Trump's prized Taj Mahal casino, which 
would undergo a prepackaged bankruptcy program just one year later.</p>
<p>"Do the interview with somebody else," Trump said. "Really. You don't
 need this. Do it with somebody else. Have a good time. Frankly, you're a
 very negative guy, and I think it's very unfair reporting."</p>
<p>At this point he walked off the set.</p>
<p>Trump's 60 Minutes interview reminded me of when he walked out of a 
1990 interview with CNN when asked about his fi… https://t.co/hqhi5wxwLj</p>

<p class="rm-manual">It's only Wednesday but it's already been quite a 
week for legal activity in Trumpworld. It's eerily reminiscent of those 
heady days back in 2017 and 2018 when everyone assumed that special 
counselor Robert Mueller's report on his investigation into Russia's 
interference in the 2016 election and potential connections to the Trump
 campaign was going to lay out all the ugly facts, leading to Trump's 
impeachment and conviction .. and then planet Earth would tilt back on 
its axis and we could all resume our normal lives. Yeah, that was dumb. 
And despite all this latest action from the state of New York as well as
 the Justice Department and the federal courts, it's highly likely the 
outcome will be the same this time. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">There is some news that could change the equation, 
however, depending — once again — on what the authorities have 
uncovered. If they do have the goods, it then depends on whether or not 
the prosecutors have the guts to take Trump and his cronies to court 
over it.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">On Tuesday night, the Washington Post <a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/05/25/manhattans-district-attorney-convenes-grand-jury-in-trump-investigation-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>
 that the Manhattan District Attorney has convened a special grand jury 
to hear evidence in the investigation into the Trump Organization. This 
news comes after the recent announcement from the Attorney General of 
New York that her office was working with the DA on a possible criminal 
case in addition to the civil case they've been investigating for some 
time. The <a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/05/26/they-got-the-mother-lode-former-federal-prosecutor-says-grand-jury-has-everything-on-trump_partner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">instant commentary on Tuesday from various experienced prosecutors</a>
 suggests that it would be unusual for a DA to do this unless they 
believed they have evidence that a crime was committed so it would 
appear that someone is on the hot seat.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">We have no idea what the evidence is, but we do 
know that the DA's office recently received the Trump tax returns after 
years of delay. The hiring of an experienced white-collar prosecutor who
 had years of experience unraveling complex criminal financial webs 
reportedly jump-started the investigation. According to the various 
leaks and comments by people who have spoken with the investigators, the
 prosecution is putting the squeeze on Trump's top money man, CFO Allen 
Weisselberg and his family. The assumption is that they are trying to 
get him to flip on Trump. The special grand jury has been seated for 6 
months and it can renew so we may be in for a wait to see what that's 
all about.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Meanwhile, in a blast from the past, we finally saw
 the release on Monday of some of the material in the Paul Manafort case
 after it was ordered by a federal judge. Everyone had wondered what 
exactly was known about Manafort and his Russian associate Konstantin 
Kilimnik. It turns out it was a lot. As Salon's Jon Skolnik<a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/05/25/the-proverbial-smoking-gun-maddow-explains-what-newly-unredacted-manafort-files-reveal/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> reported, </a>the
 previously redacted portions of the documents show Manafort was 
"sharing internal confidential polling data covered by a non-disclosure 
agreement…outside the campaign, but he's sharing it with a foreign 
national with a specific understanding and intent that it would be 
passed on to other foreign nationals, in this case Russians." Rachel 
Maddow<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/proverbial-smoking-gun-of-trump-camp-giving-info-to-russia-seen-in-unredacted-records-113140805746" rel="noopener noreferrer"> helpfully explained </a>what it meant:</p>
<blockquote class="rm-manual"> What we thought happened, happened. 
Trump's campaign chair, Paul Manafort, sharing this kind of data with a 
Russian intelligence officer is the proverbial smoking gun in terms of 
how the Trump campaign was involved in it. </blockquote>
<p class="rm-manual">Manafort was not the coffee boy. He was the campaign chairman and he knew that Trump would pardon him.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The president of the United States never had to 
answer for any of this, which brings us to the other big legal news dump
 this week (so far, at least). The same federal judge who released the 
Manafort files, Amy Jackson Berman, was equally hot under the collar 
when the Trump Justice Department lied to the court. (Judges really, 
really don't like that. ) She had ordered the DOJ to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-department-memo-mueller-trump/2021/05/24/50b0f580-b432-11eb-a980-a60af976ed44_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">release the memo </a>that
 former Attorney General Bill Barr had used to justify his decision to 
announce that the department did not believe Trump's behavior rose to 
the level of obstruction despite the massive evidence in Mueller's 
report. Judge Jackson read the unredacted memo and said she believes 
that the people have a right to see it. Biden's DOJ disagrees.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">I think everyone has expected the new attorney 
general, Merrick Garland, to comply with the judge's order in order to 
assure the public of its commitment to transparency. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-department-memo-mueller-trump/2021/05/24/50b0f580-b432-11eb-a980-a60af976ed44_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">That didn't work out.</a>
 The DOJ released only the first page and a half of the nine-page memo 
and said they were appealing the judge's order, claiming that the 
department was not intentionally misleading in saying that the memo 
guided Barr's decision when, in fact, he helped craft it after the fact.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Former Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal on MSNBC expressed extreme disappointment in the decision saying:</p>
<blockquote class="rm-manual"> I used to make those decisions at the 
Justice Department and I get why they would do this in an ordinary case 
because you want to protect prosecutors and these memos are about the 
prosecutor's thinking in a case. Ordinarily that is protected. But this 
is the furthest case from ordinary imaginable. This is about a cover-up 
potentially and protection of the Attorney General's boss, the President
 of the United States. </blockquote>
<p class="rm-manual">I am not surprised, however.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">I never thought the DOJ would do anything at all to
 pursue what went on in the Barr regime. These "institutionalists" 
always think the best way to restore their credibility is to sweep the 
past under the rug and just do a good job going forward. And that always
 ends up just normalizing the pathological behavior of the Republican 
Party.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Institutionalists are terrified of being further 
politicized. The right is shameless and couldn't care less if people 
accuse them of being rank partisans but anyone with integrity is deeply 
uncomfortable with that. And there's a guy out there with a weirdly 
acute understanding of people's weaknesses who knows exactly how to 
exploit that to his advantage. Here's what Trump wrote on his blog in 
response to the news of the NY Grand Jury on Tuesday night:</p>
<blockquote class="rm-manual"> This is purely political, and an affront 
to the almost 75 million voters who supported me in the Presidential 
Election and it's being driven by highly partisan Democrat 
prosecutors... Interesting that today a poll came out indicating I'm far
 in the lead for the Republican Presidential Primary and the General 
Election in 2024. </blockquote>
<p class="rm-manual">As you can see, he is inciting his followers to 
once again see any legal action against him as a partisan attack against
 them. (If they were Republicans, he'd just call them RINOs for the same
 effect. He said it about his own DOJ!) In fact, his probable run for 
president in 2024 is at least partly motivated by this dynamic. Any 
legal action will be framed as partisan sabotage and after January 6th 
it has the added frisson of a subtle threat of violence.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Will anyone really be brave enough to call him on 
this and hold him accountable? Stay tuned. There's a lot of legal 
activity out there. I just wouldn't get my hopes up. </p>

<p class="rm-manual"> <span>May 26, 2021</span> </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday publicly shamed 
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and three other big bank chief executives
 for raking in a collective $4 billion from overdraft fees during the 
coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs held a <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/annual-oversight-of-wall-street-firms">virtual hearing</a>
 Wednesday that featured testimony from Dimon as well as Charles Scharf 
of Wells Fargo, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, Jane Fraser of 
Citigroup, Brian Thomas Moynihan of Bank of America, and James Gorman of
 Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">While questioning the Chase CEO, Warren (D-Mass.) 
also took aim at Wells Fargo, Citi, and Bank of America. She contrasted 
"generous" pandemic-era policies of bank regulators with those that 
banks had for their customers, as millions of people struggled with the 
economic consequences of the public health crisis.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Warren highlighted that as regulators delayed 
compliance for some rules and let banks to avoid paying overdraft fees 
for Federal Reserve accounts, they also <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2020/fil20019a.pdf">recommended</a> that banks <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2004.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer">waive overdraft fees</a> for their customers.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Citing research from Pew Charitable Trusts, the 
senator noted that such fees disproportionately impact "working people 
making less than $50,000 a year, African Americans, Hispanics—people who
 are struggling to get by."</p>
<p class="rm-manual">She told Dimon, "You are the star of the Overdraft 
Show. Your bank, JPMorgan, collects more than seven times as much money 
in overdraft fees per account than your competitors."</p>

about how they stepped up and took care of customers during the…

<p class="rm-manual">Dimon said that his bank's Fed account was never 
negative and that customers who needed relief from overdraft fees could 
submit a request. He also told Warren, "I think your numbers are totally
 inaccurate, but we'll have to sit down privately to go through that."</p>
<p class="rm-manual">She responded that "these are public numbers." 
According to Warren, JPMorgan collected $1.463 billion dollars in 
overdraft fees from its customers in 2020.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">"Now, do you know how much JPMorgan's profit would 
have been in 2020 if you had followed the recommendation of the 
regulators and waived overdraft fees to help struggling consumers? In 
other words, without that overdraft money, would your bank have been in 
financial trouble?" Warren asked.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Dimon replied that "we waived the fees for customers upon request if they were under stress because of Covid."</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Warren told him, "I appreciate that you want to duck this question," and asked again; he reiterate his previous answer.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">"The answer is your profits would have been $27.6 
billion dollars. I did the math for you," Warren said. "So here's the 
thing: you and your colleagues come in today to talk about how you 
stepped up and took care of customers during the pandemic, and it's a 
bunch of baloney. In fact, it's about $4 billion dollars worth of 
baloney."</p>

<p class="rm-manual">"But you could fix that right now," she continued. 
"Mr. Dimon, will you commit right now to refund the one-and-a-half 
billion dollars you took from consumers during the pandemic?"</p>
<p class="rm-manual">His response was concise: "No."</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Warren then put the question to the other CEOs: "Will any of you agree to refund the overdraft fees that you collected?"</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In the face of silence, she said, "I didn't think 
so." The senator concluded by adding that "no matter how you try to spin
 it, this past year has shown that corporate profits are more important 
to your bank than offering just a little help to struggling 
families—even when we are in the middle of a worldwide crisis."</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in March 2020 <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/-coronavirus-brown-booker-file-legislation-to-temporarily-ban-overdraft-fees" rel="noopener noreferrer">unveiled</a> legislation that would temporarily ban bank overdraft fees for the duration of the pandemic—but it <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/big-banks-charged-billions-in-overdraft-fees-during-pandemic/" rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't go anywhere</a>. The following month, the pair <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/brown-booker-urge-banks-to-temporarily-ban-burdensome-overdraft-fees" rel="noopener noreferrer">sent</a> letters to 15 big bank CEOs, urging them to voluntarily enact such policies.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Brown, who chairs the U.S. Senate on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/majority/brown-statement-on-big-bank-hearing" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared</a> Wednesday that "Wall Street is on notice.

<p class="rm-manual">"The CEOs that came before us are the most powerful
 economic actors in the country and the signals they send to other 
companies influence workers at companies all over the country, not just 
their own employees," Brown said. "They can't say they value their 
workers and then pledge to fight employees who want to form a union. 
They can't say they are focused on lending to small businesses and 
growing the economy while spending billions on stock buybacks."</p>
<p class="rm-manual">"They can't say they put their customers first 
while charging them overdraft and late fees during a global pandemic," 
he continued. "And they can't say climate change is a threat to the 
entire economy, while dragging their feet when it comes to investing in 
new technology and the jobs of the future. We need an economy that 
reflects our values not Wall Street's. These CEOs have a lot of work to 
do."</p>
<p class="rm-manual">After the hearing, Warren <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/05/26/sen-warren-on-jamie-dimons-testimony.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared</a> on CNBC's "Closing Bell."</p>
<p class="rm-manual">"To me," Warren explained, "it's partly about 
overdraft fees and who has to pay them, but it's partly about how you 
think about bank regulation. When you give banks help and say to them, 
'as your regulator, I'm urging you to help your customers in a time of a
 pandemic,' and the banks don't do that, that tells me that the only way
 you're going to get these banks to act is by having aggressive, 
detailed regulation."</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/u/sarah_k_burris">Sarah K. Burris</a> </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span>May 26, 2021</span> </p>
<p class="rm-manual">In response to a lawsuit from Rep. Eric Swalwell 
(D-CA), Donald Trump responded that he can't be sued for anything he 
does as the president. MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell noted that it 
sounded a lot like former President Richard Nixon, who said, "when the 
president does it, it's not illegal." </p>
<p class="rm-manual">But when Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe 
reviewed the excuse and explained that not even Nixon would have made 
the excuses that Donald Trump is. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">In a case involving a civil case against Nixon, the
 Supreme Court decided that when a president is exercising his/her 
official duties as president that he/she cannot be liable. It's hard to 
claim that Trump's speech inciting an insurrection because he lost an 
election is an official duty as president. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">"The president's claim to stay in after being voted
 out by the people and the Electoral College really, takes chutzpah to a
 new level," said Tribe. "Saying 'I have a duty to you my subjects,' I 
can just hear Richard III from the play 'Hamilton,' 'I have a duty to 
you my loyal subjects!' To remain in office, to prevent Congress from 
counting the electoral votes that would kick me out of office — if a 
president had an official responsibility — if it was part of his job 
description to hold onto that office even after he's voted out of it, 
and to do it even by trying to have his own vice president hung in front
 of the Capitol by storming the Capitol, by killing Capitol Police, if 
that was part of the job description then the job that would be 
described is dictator, not president. So, it's not a claim likely to 
find favor, to put it mildly, with the courts of the United States."</p>
<p class="rm-manual">"And impeachment power is in this case, when all 
those members of the Senate voted to acquit him, including Mitch 
McConnell, they said he will be held responsible, the law will follow 
him," Tribe continued. "To use that quotation from the tweet that you 
began with, the law will follow him. He will be held accountable. That's
 why we don't have to convict him. Well, this is the law holding him 
accountable. And he says, not me, I was president of the United States. 
He just has made a fundamental mistake. The president is not sovereign. 
The president is not the king of us, he's not -- he's not George III, he
 is not even George Washington. He is exercising power as an employee of
 the people of the United States. He answers to the people, and one of 
the ways you answer to the people is by being held accountable for the 
damages that you do when you aim an angry mob at members of Congress and
 others who get severely injured as a result."</p>
