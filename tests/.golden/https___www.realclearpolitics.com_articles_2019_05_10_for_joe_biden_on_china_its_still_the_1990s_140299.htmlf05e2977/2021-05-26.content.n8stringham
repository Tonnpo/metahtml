<p>Once upon a time, May 1 -- May Day -- was a day for working-class 
parades in factory towns. This year, it was a day for Joe Biden, to set 
off on his third presidential campaign in 32 years, to make news on the 
stump, not in a working-class venue but in the university town of Iowa 
City, now the state's Democratic stronghold. </p>
<p>Biden's claims for the presidency rest heavily on foreign policy 
expertise gained in eight years as vice president and 34 years on the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And, unusually for a Democratic 
candidate this cycle, he chose to speak about China. "China is going to 
eat our lunch? Come on, man," he orated. "They can't even figure out how
 to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the 
China Sea and the mountains in the ... west. They can't figure out how 
they're going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system.
 ... They're not bad folks, folks, but guess what. They're not 
competition for us."</p>
<p>"This will not age well," tweeted Sen. Mitt Romney, who surely 
remembers how then-President Barack Obama ridiculed him in the final 
2012 presidential debate for bringing back the foreign policy of the 
1980s by characterizing Russia as our "number one geopolitical foe." </p>
<p>It turns out Romney had a point then, and he has one now. Biden's 
foreign policy views seem stuck in the 1990s. Those were optimistic 
times, with the Cold War won and no geopolitical foe in sight, with a 
surging U.S. economy complete with budget surpluses. It was "the end of 
history," in scholar Francis Fukuyama's phrase, when it seemed that 
something like the American-style democracy, human rights and dynamic 
capitalism would sweep the globe.</p>
<p>Including China. The mechanism to make it so was to bring China into 
the world trade system, a proposal supported by the Clinton 
administration, George W. Bush and most congressional Republicans. In 
2000, permanent, normal trade relations with China passed the House 
237-197 in May and the Senate 83-15 in September. Opposition came 
largely from labor Democrats and members like Reps. Chris Smith, Frank 
Wolf and Nancy Pelosi concerned about China's human rights abuses.</p>
<p>The widespread assumptions were that the international trade 
framework would lead China to respect international norms, and encourage
 the Chinese people to demand -- and the Chinese government to advance 
-- democracy and human rights. Increased trade, it was hoped, would 
produce economic growth here, as opening trade with Japan and Mexico had
 seemingly done.</p>
<p>These assumptions weren't crazy or irrational. Unfortunately, they 
turned out to be wrong. The respected bipartisan experts of 20 years ago
 turned out to be wrong. Armchair critics like Donald Trump, then 
dismissed as cranks, turned out to be right.</p>
<p>China has consistently cheated on trade rules and intellectual 
property rights. And while increased trade with China has contributed to
 American economic growth, it has also cost far more American jobs than 
respected experts predicted. </p>
<p>Chinese imports as a percentage of U.S. economic output doubled 
within four years, Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist David
 Autor reported in 2016. "We would conservatively estimate that more 
than a million manufacturing jobs in the U.S. were directly eliminated 
between 2000 and 2007 as a result of China's accelerating trade 
penetration in the United States," in markets ranging from clothing to 
jewelry, toys to furniture, he wrote. </p>
<p>Hopes for democratization and human rights have also been dashed. 
When Congress voted on China trade, Russia had been holding free 
elections, and Vladimir Putin was serving his first year as president. 
Now his reign is scheduled to extend to the 2020s, and maybe beyond. 
China has become ever bolder in its suppression of human rights and any 
demand for anything like free elections. Chinese President Xi Jinping 
has even discarded the term limits imposed on his predecessors.</p>
<p>With economic growth slowing down, China's leaders are evidently 
relying on expansionist nationalism to rally popular support. They have 
built and fortified islands in the South China Sea to claim sovereignty 
over its sea lanes and have expanded their capacity to nullify U.S. 
weapons systems. As former Trump Pentagon aide Elbridge Colby writes in 
Foreign Policy, "If the United States delays implementing a new 
approach, it risks losing a war to China or Russia -- or backing down in
 a crisis because it fears it would."</p>
<p>The hopes for a cooperative and peaceful China have unfortunately 
been dashed. But for Joe Biden, it's evidently still the 1990s. Is this 
the best the Democrats can do?</p>
