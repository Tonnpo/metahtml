<h1>North Korea says no interest in Trump summit until 'hostile policy' removed</h1>

<p>SEOUL (Reuters) - A senior North Korean official said on Wednesday that the United States must drop its &#8220;hostile policy&#8221; towards Pyongyang in order to restart stalled denuclearisation talks, South Korea&#8217;s Yonhap news agency reported. </p>

<p>Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui told reporters after meeting Russian officials in Moscow it would be &#8220;impossible&#8221; to hold another summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump if he maintains his current stance towards the North. </p>
<p>&#8220;To negotiate with the United States going forward, we would be able to discuss nuclear issues again when it withdraws all of its hostile policy against us,&#8221; Choe said, according to Yonhap. </p>
<p>&#8220;In that sense, I think a summit should not really be an issue of our interest.&#8221; </p>
<p>She did not specify what constituted such a policy, but North Korea&#8217;s foreign ministry said on Sunday that a recent United Nations resolution on its human rights was a U.S.-led &#8220;political provocation&#8221;. </p>
<p>North Korea has also called for an end to joint military drills with South Korea, as well as sanctions that crippled its economy. </p>
<p>When asked what U.S. action was needed to restart the talks, Choe said the Americans &#8220;know very well&#8221;. </p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. side will have to lift all measures with which they treat us as an enemy and then inform us of such a strategic decision,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>Kim and Trump held a first, landmark summit in Singapore in June last year and agreed to improve relations and negotiate an end to North Korea&#8217;s nuclear and missile programmes. </p>
<p>The efforts have made no substantial progress and their second summit collapsed in Vietnam in February. </p>

<p>The two leaders agreed in June, at a third meeting at the inter-Korean border, to re-open negotiations. But working-level talks in October between officials in Sweden ended with the North Korean envoy accusing the Americans of coming to the table empty-handed. </p>
<p>Choe, one of North Korea&#8217;s key nuclear negotiators, met Russian officials including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Wednesday, Yonhap said. </p>
<p>Her remarks were the latest in a series of statements in recent weeks by senior Pyongyang officials calling for U.S. action, as a year-end deadline set by Kim for Washington to show more flexibility draws near. </p>
