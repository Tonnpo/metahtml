<p class="rm-manual">November 29, 1999 by <a href="file:///go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzE2OTczLnBocA==">www.medicalnewstoday.com</a> </p>
<p>While kissing a slimy frog may not be the best route to finding your 
Prince Charming, frog slime has been suggested to protect against flu. 
According to researchers from the Emory Vaccine Center and the Rajiv 
Gandhi Center for Biotechnology in India, frog slime can destroy the H1 
variety of influenza viruses. The discovery was published in Immunity 
and was led by senior author Joshy Jacob, Ph.D., associate professor of 
microbiology and immunology at the Emory Vaccine Center and Emory 
University School of Medicine. Prof. Jacob and graduate student David 
Holthausen collaborated on the research project with M.R. Pillai, Ph.D.,
 and Sanil George, Ph.D., from the Rajiv Gandhi Center for 
Biotechnology. Previous research has shown that frogs’ skins secrete 
mucus that contains “host defense peptides,” known to protect them from 
harmful bacteria. The new study reveals that the skin secretions from 
South Indian frogs act as “anti-flu peptides” and could prove useful in 
the antiviral drug arena. For example, anti-flu peptides could be an 
invaluable resource if there were a new influenza pandemic. Influenza 
pandemics occur when there is an outbreak of a novel influenza strain 
that emerges, infects, and spreads quickly and easily. In the absence of
 a vaccine… <a href="file:///go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzE2OTczLnBocA==" rel="nofollow">Read full this story</a></p>
