<p> <span>Villagers attend a funeral for Moe Zaw Oo and Zaw Min Oo, who 
were shot dead by security forces, at a cemetery in Mon state's 
Chaungzon township, June 21, 2021.</span> </p>

<p>Security forces loyal to Myanmar’s military regime are believed to 
have killed at least 13 civilians over the weekend, including four 
members of the same family, a young man delivering invitations to his 
wedding, and two people returning home from a soccer game.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, unidentified gunmen stormed a home in the 
Nyaungbin Thar ward of Sagaing region’s Kalay township, killing 
50-year-old Win Zaw Oo, his 48-year-old wife San San Maw, his 
23-year-old son Thiha Aung, and his 35-year-old son-in-law Zaw Zaw.</p>
<p>A neighbor, who spoke to RFA’s Myanmar Service on condition of 
anonymity citing a fear of reprisal, said the gunmen entered the home 
through a nearby alleyway before opening fire.</p>
<p>“The first gunshot was heard at about 8:30 p.m. It wasn’t very loud, so the other neighbors may not have heard,” he said.</p>
<p>“Then we heard voices saying, ‘Come out, open the door, come outside’
 and then there were more gunshots. Win Zaw Oo and his son tried to run 
to the house across the street, but they were shot and killed 
instantly.”</p>
<p>According to the neighbor, San San Maw and Zaw Zaw were killed inside
 the house. Win Zaw Oo’s daughter, 25-year-old San Shwe Oo, and a 
visitor were also shot and wounded, while another visitor escaped 
unharmed.</p>
<p>The gunmen appeared to be wearing military uniforms and boots, as 
well as red scarves around their necks, he said, adding that it was 
unclear what kind of guns they were carrying because of the darkness.</p>
<p>Residents told RFA that the family of the deceased had been living in
 Nyaungbin Thar for the past two decades and “had ties with the 
military.” The Irrawaddy online news agency cited residents as saying 
that junta soldiers had killed the four in a raid, during which around 
40 million kyats (U.S. $24,300), a car and other possessions were 
seized.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the junta on Sunday said that “supporters of 
the ousted National League for Democracy (NLD) party” and “terrorists” 
had carried out a series of killings, assassinations, and destructive 
acts in recent weeks, including “setting up landmines to intimidate 
peaceful people.”</p>
<p>It claimed Saturday’s killings were perpetrated by such “destructive 
elements,” adding that an investigation of the scene by security forces 
had discovered four dead, as well as the injured daughter, who was taken
 to a nearby military hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>However, a member of the Kalay branch of the People’s Defense Forces 
(PDF) militia that was formed in the aftermath of the military’s Feb. 1 
overthrow of the government to protect the public from junta troops told
 RFA that his group had nothing to do with the incident.</p>
<p>He claimed the militia had obtained evidence that the military was 
responsible for the weekend killings and others, which he said were 
blamed on groups such as his to “tarnish the image of PDFs all over the 
country.”</p>
<p>“We have witnesses from the surrounding area in this case. It was 
widely reported on social media that the military came in their 
uniforms. We also have our own evidence that they did it,” he said.</p>
<p>“We strongly believe that the PDFs do not do these kinds of things to the people because we fight to defend them."</p>
<p>Relatives of those killed on Saturday declined to comment when contacted by RFA because of security concerns.</p>
<p>The four victims were buried Sunday, according to residents, who said
 that military troops searched the cellphones of mourners attending the 
funeral. San Shwe Oo was taken to a hospital in Mandalay on Monday for 
additional treatment, family members said.</p>
<p>Residents of Kalay claim that more than 40 people have been killed in the township since the February coup d’état.</p>

<p>A day after the incident in Kalay township, security forces in 
Mandalay region’s Singu township shot and killed a young bridegroom 
named Kyaw Kyaw Myo as he and a friend distributed invitations for his 
upcoming wedding to villagers in Nyein Chan Aung ward by motorcycle, 
residents said.</p>
<p>“He was shot at around 8:30 p.m. while asking people to attend and 
help out at the wedding,” one resident told RFA. “He didn’t understand 
why he had been shot. His friend was also arrested.”</p>
<p>The wedding of Kyaw Kyaw Myo and his fiancé Aye Aye Aung was slated 
to take place on June 24 at the bride’s residence in Singu township’s 
Gyobin village. Instead, Kyaw Kyaw Myo’s family retrieved his body from 
the military on Monday and is now planning his funeral.</p>
<p>Residents of Letpanhla village told RFA that Kyaw Kyaw Myo's friend remains in military custody.</p>
<p>Also on Sunday, security forces in the Mon state capital Mawlamyaing 
shot and killed two people who failed to stop their motorbike at a 
checkpoint while returning home from a soccer game, according to 
residents.</p>
<p>An official with the Mawlamyaing Social Relief Association, who spoke
 on condition of anonymity, said he and his colleagues helped to carry 
the bodies of the two men, who were later identified as Moe Zaw Oo and 
Zaw Min Oo from Abit village in Chaungzon township’s Bilukyun ward.</p>
<p>“As far as we know, they were asked to stop the motorcycle for an 
inspection,” the official said. “I heard from the police that they 
resisted the inspection and the forces fired at them.”</p>
<p>An eyewitness to the shooting said Moe Zaw Oo and Zaw Min Oo were 
shot four and three times respectively. He said their bodies were taken 
to the Mawlamyaing People’s Hospital on Sunday evening, and returned to 
their families on Monday.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Irrawaddy cited militia members as saying that 
junta soldiers in Sagaing region’s Myaung township shot and killed three
 members of the Sanpya Social Organization on Saturday night as they 
returned home to Magwe region’s Yesagyo township in an ambulance.</p>
<p>It said that an additional three people were killed in Sagaing region’s Kani and Khin-U townships on Saturday.</p>
<p>Attempts by RFA to reach Myanmar’s military spokesman for comment on the killings over the weekend went unanswered Monday.</p>
<p>According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners 
(AAPP), the military has killed at least 873 people since it 
orchestrated a coup on Feb. 1, claiming that the NLD’s landslide victory
 in the country’s November 2020 election was the result of widespread 
voter fraud. The junta has yet to present evidence of its claims and 
security forces have responded to nationwide protests with deadly force.</p>
<p>AAPP says some 5,045 people have been detained, charged or sentenced in the five months since the coup.</p>
<p>The group reported over the weekend that at least 25 people have been
 killed by the military while in detention since February—the latest of 
which was a 27-year-old man named Thet Paing Htoo who was beaten to 
death after being arrested on Saturday for his alleged involvement in 
anti-coup protests.</p>

<p>Also on Saturday, supporters of NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi held a 
widespread flower protest to mark her 76th birthday and demand her 
immediate release.</p>
<p>The State Counselor who, along with several other NLD officials, was 
detained in the aftermath of the February putsch, has been charged in 
six cases in the capital Naypyidaw and one in Yangon.</p>
<p>The charges -- violating the Official Secrets Act, bribery, 
incitement and sedition, violating the telecommunications law, 
possession of unlicensed two-way radios, and violating protocols set up 
to contain the spread of the coronavirus – are widely seen as designed 
to end her role in politics.</p>
<p>Aung San Suu Kyi’s lawyer, Min Min Soe, relayed a message of thanks 
to well-wishers after meeting with her on the second week of her hearing
 on the last three charges in Naypyidaw on Monday, adding that the NLD 
chief is in good health.</p>
<p>He said she listened carefully to the cases made by the prosecution, 
deliberately stating the facts and describing how she was innocent of 
the charges against her.</p>
<p>Aung San Suu Kyi’s trial, which began on June 14 and is being heard 
weekly on Mondays and Tuesdays, is expected to be completed within six 
months.</p>
<p>The democracy icon and Nobel Peace Prize laureate spent a total of 15
 years under house arrest over a 21-year period that ended in 2010 under
 the country’s previous junta regime.</p>
<p>Myanmar’s shadow civilian National Unity Government (NUG) has said 
that Aung San Suu Kyi and other detained NLD leaders were unlawfully 
arrested and rejected the charges against them.</p>
