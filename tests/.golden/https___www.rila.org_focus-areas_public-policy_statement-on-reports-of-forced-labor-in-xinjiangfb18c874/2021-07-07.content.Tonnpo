<h1 class="rm-manual">Statement on Reports of Forced Labor in Xinjiang</h1>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Joint Statement from AAFA, FDRA, NRF, RILA, USFIA</h2>
<ul class="rm-manual"> <li class="rm-manual"> By [ <a href="file:///about-rila/melissa-murdock">Melissa Murdock</a> , <a href="file:///about-rila/blake-harden">Blake Harden</a> ] </li> <li class="rm-manual">Washington, DC</li> <li class="rm-manual">03/10/2020</li> </ul>
<p class=""> As an industry representing brands and retailers, we do not
 tolerate forced labor in our supply chains. We work together to 
identify and eliminate forced labor, and conditions that can lead to 
forced labor, in the countries from which we source products. The 
industry continues to evolve and improve our existing approaches to 
identify, detect, and address risks of forced labor in our supply 
chains. We actively engage countries all over the world to advance 
respect for human rights. We are deeply concerned by reports of forced 
labor and the treatment of Uyghurs and other ethnic minority workers in 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and elsewhere in China. The
 reported situation is of a scale, scope, and complexity that is 
unprecedented during the modern era of global supply chains. As 
acknowledged by both the U.S. government and non-government experts, the
 conditions in Xinjiang and the treatment of ethnic minority workers 
from the region present profound challenges to the integrity of the 
global supply chain, including issues of transparency, access, and 
auditing. Accepting the status quo is not an option. Companies across 
the industry are considering all available approaches to address the 
situation. Brands and retailers are drawing on expert guidance and 
assembling industry stakeholders to address the situation. We are 
framing these actions through the lens of the United Nations (UN) 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and our own commitment 
to the fair treatment of workers in our supply chains. Our members have 
expressed strong concerns to their suppliers and reiterated that 
suppliers must maintain a supply chain that is free of involuntary and 
forced labor. While we are taking action, our industry cannot solve this
 alone. A successful solution for all, including the workers, will 
require state-to-state engagement and collaborative partnerships across 
government, industry, labor advocates, non-governmental organizations, 
and other stakeholders. Therefore, we urge the U.S. government to 
immediately engage a multi-stakeholder working group to develop and 
deploy a collective approach that accurately assesses the problem, and 
find constructive solutions that target bad actors and protect the 
rights of workers and the integrity of global supply chains. </p>
