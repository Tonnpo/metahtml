<p><span><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html">The U.S. is monitoring intelligence</a> which indicates that the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has faltered. But South Korea has thrown cold water on </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html"><span><span>reports</span></span></a><span> that the dictator is "in grave danger after surgery," with the</span> president's office saying it had "detected no special signs inside North Korea" so far.</p>
<p><span>It would not be the first time North Korea has been misread. 
The highly-secretive country is by design difficult to penetrate — for 
outsiders and its own citizens alike. The government purposefully 
obscures its activities, publishing disinformation and </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-koreas-strangest-propaganda-moments"><span><span>famously risible propaganda</span></span></a><span>.
 And it has become even more difficult to sniff out the truth since 
North Korea sealed its borders in late January due to the coronavirus 
pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span>The current speculation began Monday night, when Daily NK, a 
Seoul website that monitors North Korea, reported that Kim was 
recovering from cardiovascular surgery earlier this month. A source from
 inside the regime reportedly said the North Korean leader had been 
experiencing cardiovascular difficulty for a few months as a result of 
obesity and heavy smoking but "worsened after repeated visits to Mount 
Paektu."</span></p>
<p><span>Kim's recent trips to Paektu — the dynasty's sacred volcano on 
the Chinese border — were heavily publicized within the country, 
including Putin-esque </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50655693"><span><span>photographs</span></span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtEE9lOWfAY"><span><span>video</span></span></a><span> of the 36-year-old dictator riding a stallion up the snow-covered slopes.</span></p>
<p><span>North Korea watchers raised questions about Kim's health on 
April 14. He failed to show for a cruise missile demonstration as part 
of his grandfather's birthday festivities, and state media did not cover
 the launch at all. Kim also did not pay a birthday visit to his 
grandfather's mausoleum the next day, an act which Cheong Seong-chang, 
director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute 
in South Korea told the New York Times was "the closest thing to 
blasphemy in the North" and "all but unthinkable."</span></p>
<p><span>"It is reasonable to think that there is something temporarily 
wrong with his health, although it may stretch things too much if we say
 his life is in danger," Cheong said.</span></p>
<p><span>A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters that the 
government knew of the reports but would not say whether it has any more
 information.</span></p>
<p><span>North Korea also tried to tamp down the news, claiming Tuesday 
morning through government news agency Yonhap that Kim just sent a 
birthday letter to Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel.</span></p>
<p><span>The confusion is useful to the weak regime, but it frustrates outside observers, who can </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/world/asia/in-kim-jong-uns-absence-rumors-about-him-swirl-in-north-korea.html"><span><span>get lost in rumors</span></span></a><span> about torture, grisly executions and military development. Though it obscures and often </span><span><span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11813699">overblows</a></span></span><span> the truth, many of these concerns are well grounded in reality. Kim had his half-brother </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43312052"><span><span>assassinated with a nerve agent</span></span></a><span> in a Malaysian airport and reportedly </span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korea-defector-anti-aircraft-guns-execution-kim-jong-un-killed-sex-slaves-pyongyang-porn-film-a7959851.html"><span><span>executed musicians with anti-aircraft guns</span></span></a><span>. The regime spends lavishly on its military and nuclear programs as millions of its citizens </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/06/north-korean-lives-matter/"><span><span>starve</span></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The family's poor medical history fuels speculation, too. Kim's
 father and grandfather both had diabetes, and both died of heart 
failure. Kim Jong-un disappeared for more than a month in 2014, sparking
 speculation about poor health, a coup or </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/world/asia/kim-jong-un-north-korea.html"><span><span>a massive hangover</span></span></a><span>. He walked with a cane when he finally resurfaced, having had a cyst removed from his ankle.</span></p>
<p><span>But what if Kim really is deathly ill? North Korea is a failed 
nuclear state, and Kim — who has purged the government of all threats to
 his power — might be the only thing holding it intact, such as it is.</span></p>
<p><span>Some experts believe that his younger sister, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/world/asia/kim-jong-un-sister-south-korea.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fasia&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=asia%C2%AEion=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront"><span><span>Kim Yo-jong</span></span></a><span>,
 could be the "natural heir to the throne." She has joined Kim in 
meetings with international leaders, including from China and the U.S. 
She traveled as North Korea's government envoy for the 2018 Winter 
Olympics in South Korea, and she again dove again into foreign policy </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/world/asia/kim-sister-korea.html"><span><span>a statement</span></span></a><span> calling the South Korean president an "imbecile." </span></p>
<p><span>"She is the natural heir to the throne, as the Kim family 
regime is more a dynasty than republic," Lee Sung-yoon, a North Korea 
expert at Tufts University told The Times.</span></p>
<p><span>But other experts feel the North's rigid patriarchy would not accept a female leader, especially one so young.</span></p>
<p><span>"It takes time before a report on North Korea is proven right 
or wrong, and even if a story turns out to be wrong, there is little 
disadvantage for reporting it," Lee Won-sup, a former journalist who is 
now a professor of news media studies at Gachon University in South 
Korea, said in 2014.</span></p>
<p><span>"That's why we repeatedly see incorrect, sensational and fictional news reports quoting anonymous sources," he added.</span></p>
