<h2 class="rm-manual">A nuclear weapon has a life cycle just like a 
person. But the aging process is harder to weight. When is old too old? 
Time will tell.</h2>

<p>It’s complicated, making sure a nuclear weapon will work as designed.</p>
<p>A 1992 moratorium that ended decades of large underground nuclear 
tests, an aging stockpile and the need to refurbish weapons have 
transformed what’s known as stockpile evaluation or integrated 
surveillance.</p>
<p>Sandia National Laboratories, which is responsible for some 97 
percent of the non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons, tested 
components in various ways even before the moratorium. Sandia’s core 
mission is nuclear weapons, and over the years, it has developed 
ever-more sophisticated tests and increased computer modeling and 
simulations to qualify nuclear weapons — certify they will work as 
designed but won’t work in an accident or when they’re not authorized by
 the president, says Scott Holswade, Sandia's deputy chief weapons 
engineer.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Sandia formed a Research Challenge, Revolutionary 
Approaches to the Stockpile, to bring together a variety of experts to 
address, among other things, how to ensure a thorough understanding of 
how weapons age and what that means for a smaller, older stockpile. 
Research Challenges are longer-range projects that address important 
national security questions.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Energy (DOE) 
set requirements for weapons. Sandia must consider all the environments 
weapons could face, such as vibration or radiation, then come up with 
designs to handle those and tests to make sure designs meet 
requirements, says Toby Townsend, stockpile systems engineering senior 
manager. Once weapons enter the stockpile, Sandia must continue testing 
to assure they meet requirements as they age.</p>
<p>Typically, a weapon has a so-called protected period, the lifespan 
it’s designed for — 20 years, for example. Engineers certify it through 
such processes as accelerated aging, using environmental test chambers 
to speed up conditions the weapon could face over time.</p>
<p>“We’re often asked, ‘How much longer could the weapon potentially be 
good for?’ That’s a major part of the stewardship mission,” Townsend 
says.</p>
<h2>Stages of the life cycle</h2>
<figcaption> The Validation and Qualification Sciences Experimental 
Complex is a unique group of test facilities, including this centrifuge,
 that create a broad range of engineering environments used in Sandia’s 
national security mission work. </figcaption><p>At one time, most 
weapons were either newly in production or fairly early in their life 
cycle and were retired before they aged much more than about 10 years. 
Now, the stockpile includes systems that have been there for decades and
 newly refurbished weapons that reuse some older parts with some new 
ones. </p>
<p>“A pediatrician does not look at the same things that a geriatrics 
expert would. The things you’re looking for in ‘pediatrics,’ the defects
 in design and production, are different than if you’re looking for 
aging effects for something late in its life cycle,” Holswade says. “I 
think that’s been the big evolution of the program, to start 
implementing changes that recognize this and the need to change the 
program to optimize for each system, depend-</p>
<p>ing on where it is in the life cycle.”</p>
<p>A weapon coming into the stockpile, such as the refurbished W76-1, is
 tested at very high rates to catch possible design or manufacturing 
defects. However, the question is different for a weapon that’s been in 
the stockpile a while: How does aging affect it?</p>
<p>Jay Vinson, senior manager for Integrated Stockpile Evaluation, says 
assessments of the non-nuclear systems include laboratory testing, 
largely at the Weapons Evaluation Test Laboratory (WETL) at the Pantex 
Plant near Amarillo, Texas. Assessments also include non-nuclear 
system-level flight testing of gravity bombs at Tonopah Test Range in 
Nevada, cruise missiles at the Utah Test and Training Range, Air Force 
ballistic missiles flown into the Pacific from Vandenberg Air Force Base
 in California and Navy submarine-launched missiles flown in the 
Atlantic and the Pacific, he says. Numerous places, including Sandia, 
the Kansas City National Security Campus and WETL, do component tests.</p>
<figcaption> Left to right: Juan Elizondo-Decanini, Kevin Youngman and Matt Senkow discuss neutron generators. </figcaption><p>During
 development of modifications such as a life extension program or an 
alteration, tests qualify individual components up to whole systems. 
“There will be temperature cycling, there’ll be vibration, there’ll be 
shock, there will be radiation, there might be voltage changes, all 
kinds of things that the system is subjected to, done in accordance with
 a plan that combines testing with simulation to make sure we’re working
 through in a systematic way what’s required to qualify the weapon for 
operation,” Holswade says. “The goal is absolute certainty that the 
design is good to perform.”</p>
<h2>Tests and more tests</h2>
<p>Once production begins, the program must assure the as-built weapon 
conforms to the as-designed weapon. “You can have production errors, or 
you may have missed something in the design process that only reveals 
itself as you get to higher volumes,” Holswade says.</p>
<p>Vinson says that as production ramps up, Sandia does more retrofit 
evaluation sample testing, pulling units before they go into the 
stockpile to catch possible production errors or early-onset failures.</p>
<p>Weapons also are pulled from the field to test later when they’ve 
been handled by military personnel and might have been on a submarine or
 missile. At that point, engineers want to study whether field 
conditions exposed a problem. </p>
<figcaption> In the ongoing effort to refurbish the aging B61 nuclear 
bomb without underground testing, Sandia engineers completed two 
successful B61-12 radar drop tests at the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada. </figcaption><p>Some
 weapons from the field are built into joint test assemblies, mock 
weapons without nuclear materials but fitted with sensors and 
instrumentation to assess performance. Flight testing is part of the 
qualification process for refurbished weapons, and its main objective is
 to obtain reliability, accuracy and performance data under operational 
conditions. Scientists and engineers use the test data in computer 
simulations developed by Sandia to evaluate systems’ reliability and to 
verify they functioned as designed. </p>
<p>The W80-1 Air Launched Cruise Missile Surveillance Flight Test 
Program fielded a joint test assembly in June, simulating a long flight 
to a target and performing arming maneuvers. “In this case, the nuclear 
explosive package is replaced by the testing assembly, so the system 
won’t detonate, but it will function with all the Sandia componentry 
along that trajectory,” Vinson says. “The various safety functions and 
other weapon functions will occur as if it were a wartime environment. 
We want that to all work properly because it indicates we have a safe 
and reliable weapon.”</p>
<p>Weapons in some flight tests have high explosives that detonate, with
 instruments sending out data during flight. In other cases, instead of 
explosives, sensors in the system check that the detonation chain would 
function. Instruments send out the data during flight but engineers 
recover that system afterward for further diagnostics. For B61-12 flight
 tests at Tonopah, real-time telemetry data gathered during flight tests
 are monitored and verified at the range’s Test Operations Center and 
main telemetry ground station and sent to Sandia in Albuquerque. </p>
<p>“We can’t fly every potential trajectory because you’re limited by 
where you can launch from and where you can land. We can’t fly every 
weather condition because you’re stuck with the weather you have when 
the flight’s scheduled,” Holswade says. So engineers do additional tests
 on components and subsystems for those “corner cases” — like the 
hottest day with the biggest shock condition or the coldest day with 
more vibration.</p>
<h2>Simulation anchored by experimental data</h2>
<p>Sandia’s large environmental test facilities can evaluate components 
under a wide range of conditions. That doesn’t mean testing is easy — 
combining environments is especially challenging. Engineers might test 
how well a component works in a radiation environment, but it’s 
difficult to combine radiation and shock testing, for example. So 
researchers use simulation anchored by experimental data. That lets 
researchers assess components when it’s not realistic to test every 
possible scenario, Townsend says.</p>
<p>“It gives us a lot more confidence across the spectrum of environments,” he says.</p>
<p>Because Sandia is responsible for nuclear weapons parts that must 
have a high degree of reliability, materials scientists, engineers, 
computer scientists, modelers and others also are working on projects 
under a separate Research Challenge, Engineering of Materials 
Reliability. That program is focusing efforts on understanding how the 
variability of materials can affect stockpile performance, with the goal
 of building a foundation to understand and predict the limits of a 
material’s performance and its contribution to reliability of engineered
 structures.</p>
<p>“Sandia has to guarantee the part works for decades,” says Amy Sun, a
 member of the leadership team for the research. “It’s an inherent 
challenge to understand how materials perform, under what conditions a 
material changes its property and whether a part we want to design can 
tolerate those changes that come naturally with aging or an external 
influence like the weather. It’s important we invest early to anticipate
 what problems there may be in the future.”</p>
<figcaption> Moses Jones works on a Sandia neutron generator. The device
 has linear accelerators that produce neutrons by fusing isotopes of 
hydrogen together. </figcaption><p> The Research Challenge incorporates 
and broadens many materials and engineering efforts, including Sandia’s 
Predicting Performance Margins project and other Laboratory Directed 
Research and Development and Advanced Simulation and Computing 
activities that study how variability in materials’ atomic 
configurations and microstructures could affect how actual parts 
perform. It includes several demonstration projects, including the 
Brittle Materials Assurance Prediction initiative, which is studying the
 properties of materials such as glass that can fail catastrophically, 
and “Born Qualified,” which is look-ing at new materials challenges and 
opportunities posed by additive manufacturing.</p>
<p>“We consider stockpile stewardship as our most important mission for 
engineering materials reliability, but we know that it’s relevant to all
 mission areas at Sandia where materials reliability is one of the 
requirements,” Sun says.</p>

<h2 class="rm-manual">Meet Kina Winoto</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">In high school, Kina Winoto wanted to be an FBI 
agent or join the military. She thought about the Naval Academy for 
college. “Weirdly enough, I always wanted to work for the government,” 
she says. Her parents urged her to wait to enlist, so she enrolled at 
the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">She was drawn back to government after graduation 
and did an internship at the Department of Defense, where she heard 
about Sandia Labs and its national security mission. “That really 
resonated with me,” she says. “I homed in on that type of work.” </p>
<p class="rm-manual">Winoto’s role model was her dad, a molecular cell 
biology professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “He tried 
really, really hard to get me into science, and it was fun,” she says. 
“I have great memories of experiments and Lawrence Hall of Science camps
 and science fairs. He pushed me to ask questions.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Winoto took her first computer science class as a 
high school freshman. Another was offered her sophomore year, but that 
was it. She wanted to know more and enrolled in computer science in 
college. “I didn’t get enough in high school,” she says. “I remember a 
moment in my third year of college when I thought, ‘Wait, am I majoring 
in computer science?’ I hadn’t really thought about it. I just kept 
wanting to learn more.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Winoto joined Sandia in 2012 and earned her 
master’s degree through the labs’ Critical Skills Master’s Program. She 
works in cybersecurity where her focus has been on integrating 
state-of-the-art techniques with mission-critical data. A lot of her 
work has been in data analytics in the cyber application space. But 
Winoto is a jack of all trades, having worked in everything from 
software development of big data processing tools to applied statistics.
 She’s working now on bringing numerical linear algebra techniques to 
mixed-type datasets to let analysts more efficiently identify anomalies.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In her spare time Winoto raises and helps train 
guide dogs for the blind. She builds furniture with her fiancé and does 
acroyoga, which combines yoga and acrobatics.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“Sandia has really shaped my career as a data 
scientist and inspired me to work on mission-critical problems.” she 
says. “On the path I’ve taken, every day brings new and exciting 
discoveries.”</p>
