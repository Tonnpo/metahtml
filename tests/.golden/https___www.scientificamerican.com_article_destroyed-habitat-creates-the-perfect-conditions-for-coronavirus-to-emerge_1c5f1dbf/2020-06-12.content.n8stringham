<p>Mayibout 2 is not a healthy place. The 150 or so people who live in 
the village, which sits on the south bank of the Ivindo River, deep in 
the great Minkebe forest in northern Gabon, are used to occasional bouts
 of diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and sleeping 
sickness. Mostly they shrug them off.</p>
<p>But in January 1996, Ebola, a deadly virus then barely known to humans, unexpectedly <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/virus/filo/eboz.html">spilled out of the forest</a>
 in a wave of small epidemics. The disease killed 21 of 37 villagers who
 were reported to have been infected, including a number who had 
carried, skinned, chopped or eaten a chimpanzee from the nearby forest.</p>
<p>I traveled to Mayibout 2 in 2004 to investigate why deadly diseases 
new to humans were emerging from biodiversity “hot spots” like tropical 
rainforests and bushmeat markets in African and Asian cities.</p>
<p>It took a day by canoe and then many hours down degraded forest 
logging roads passing Baka villages and a small gold mine to reach the 
village. There, I found traumatized people still fearful that the deadly
 virus, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease">which kills up to 90% of the people it infects</a>, would return.</p>
<p>Villagers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jun/17/research.highereducation">told me</a>
 how children had gone into the forest with dogs that had killed a 
chimp. They said that everyone who cooked or ate it got a terrible fever
 within a few hours. Some died immediately, while others were taken down
 the river to hospital. A few, like Nesto Bematsick, recovered. “We used
 to love the forest, now we fear it,” he told me. Many of Bematsick’s 
family members died.</p>
<p>Only a decade or two ago it was widely thought that tropical forests 
and intact natural environments teeming with exotic wildlife threatened 
humans by harboring the viruses and pathogens that lead to new diseases 
in humans like Ebola, HIV and dengue.</p>
<p>But a number of researchers today think that it is actually 
humanity’s destruction of biodiversity that creates the conditions for 
new viruses and diseases like COVID-19, the viral disease that emerged 
in China in December 2019, to arise—with profound health and economic 
impacts in rich and poor countries alike. In fact, a new discipline, 
planetary health, is emerging that focuses on the increasingly visible 
connections among the well-being of humans, other living things and 
entire ecosystems.</p>
<p>Is it possible, then, that it was human activity, such as road 
building, mining, hunting and logging, that triggered the Ebola 
epidemics in Mayibout 2 and elsewhere in the 1990s and that is 
unleashing new terrors today?</p>
<p>“We invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor 
so many species of animals and plants—and within those creatures, so 
many unknown viruses,” David Quammen, author of Spillover: Animal 
Infections and the Next Pandemic, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/opinion/coronavirus-china.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytopinion">recently wrote</a>
 in the New York Times. “We cut the trees; we kill the animals or cage 
them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems, and we shake 
viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a 
new host. Often, we are it.”</p>
<h2>Increasing Threat</h2>
<p><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2014.0950">Research suggests</a>
 that outbreaks of animal-borne and other infectious diseases like 
Ebola, SARS, bird flu and now COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, 
are on the rise. Pathogens are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/zoonotic-diseases.html">crossing from animals to humans</a>,
 and many are now able to spread quickly to new places. The U.S. Centers
 for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that three-quarters 
of “new or emerging” diseases that infect humans originate in nonhuman 
animals.</p>
<p>Some, like rabies and plague, crossed from animals centuries ago. 
Others, like Marburg, which is thought to be transmitted by bats, are 
still rare. A few, like COVID-19, which emerged last year in Wuhan, 
China, and MERS, which is linked to camels in the Middle East, are new 
to humans and spreading globally.</p>
<p>Other diseases <a href="https://www.who.int/zoonoses/diseases/en/">that have crossed into humans</a> include <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lassa-fever-origins-reservoirs-transmission-and-guidelines">Lassa fever</a>,
 which was first identified in 1969 in Nigeria; Nipah from Malaysia; and
 SARS from China, which killed more than 700 people and traveled to 30 
countries in 2002–03. Some, like Zika and West Nile virus, which emerged
 in Africa, have mutated and become established on other continents.</p>
<p>Kate Jones, chair of ecology and biodiversity at UCL, calls emerging 
animal-borne infectious diseases an “increasing and very significant 
threat to global health, security and economies.”</p>
<h2>Amplification Effect</h2>
<p>In 2008, Jones and a team of researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06536">identified</a> 335 diseases that emerged between 1960 and 2004, at least 60% of which came from non-human animals.</p>
<p>Increasingly, says Jones, these zoonotic diseases are linked to 
environmental change and human behavior. The disruption of pristine 
forests driven by logging, mining, <a href="https://ensia.com/voices/if-our-planet-had-a-say-heres-where-future-roads-would-go/">road building through remote places</a>,
 rapid urbanization and population growth is bringing people into closer
 contact with animal species they may never have been near before, she 
says.</p>
<p>The resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans, she 
says, is now “a hidden cost of human economic development. There are 
just so many more of us, in every environment. We are going into largely
 undisturbed places and being exposed more and more. We are creating 
habitats where viruses are transmitted more easily, and then we are 
surprised that we have new ones.”</p>
<p>Jones studies how land use change contributes to the risk. “We are 
researching how species in degraded habitats are likely to carry more 
viruses which can infect humans,” she says. “Simpler systems get an 
amplification effect. Destroy landscapes, and the species you are left 
with are the ones humans get the diseases from.”</p>
<p>“There are countless pathogens out there continuing to evolve which 
at some point could pose a threat to humans,” says Eric Fevre, chair of 
veterinary infectious diseases at the University of Liverpool’s <a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/infection-and-global-health/">Institute of Infection and Global Health</a>. “The risk [of pathogens jumping from animals to humans] has always been there.”</p>
<p>The difference between now and a few decades ago, Fevre says, is that
 diseases are likely to spring up in both urban and natural 
environments. “We have created densely packed populations where 
alongside us are bats and rodents and birds, pets and other living 
things. That creates intense interaction and opportunities for things to
 move from species to species,” he says.</p>
<h2>Tip of the Iceberg</h2>
<p>“Pathogens do not respect species boundaries,” says disease ecologist
 Thomas Gillespie, an associate professor in Emory University’s <a href="http://envs.emory.edu/home/index.html">Department of Environmental Sciences</a>
 who studies how shrinking natural habitats and changing behavior add to
 the risks of diseases spilling over from animals to humans.</p>
<p>“I am not at all surprised about the coronavirus outbreak,” he says. 
“The majority of pathogens are still to be discovered. We are at the 
very tip of the iceberg.”</p>
<p>Humans, says Gillespie, are creating the conditions for the spread of
 diseases by reducing the natural barriers between virus host animals—in
 which the virus is naturally circulating—and themselves. “We fully 
expect the arrival of pandemic influenza; we can expect large-scale 
human mortalities; we can expect other pathogens with other impacts. A 
disease like Ebola is not easily spread. But something with a mortality 
rate of Ebola spread by something like measles would be catastrophic,” 
Gillespie says.</p>
<p>Wildlife everywhere is being put under more stress, he says. “Major 
landscape changes are causing animals to lose habitats, which means 
species become crowded together and also come into greater contact with 
humans. Species that survive change are now moving and mixing with 
different animals and with humans.”</p>
<p>Gillespie sees this in the U.S., where suburbs fragmenting forests 
raise the risk of humans contracting Lyme disease. “Altering the 
ecosystem affects the complex cycle of the Lyme pathogen. People living 
close by are more likely to get bitten by a tick carrying Lyme 
bacteria,” he says.</p>

 human health research seldom considers the surrounding natural 
ecosystems, says Richard Ostfeld, distinguished senior scientist at the 
Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York. He and 
others are developing the emerging discipline of planetary health, which
 looks at the links between human and ecosystem health.</p>
<p>“There’s misapprehension among scientists and the public that natural
 ecosystems are the source of threats to ourselves. It’s a mistake. 
Nature poses threats, it is true, but it’s human activities that do the 
real damage. The health risks in a natural environment can be made much 
worse when we interfere with it,” he says.</p>
<p>Ostfeld points to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/diseases/direct.html">rats</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/index.html">bats</a>,
 which are strongly linked with the direct and indirect spread of 
zoonotic diseases. “Rodents and some bats thrive when we disrupt natural
 habitats. They are the most likely to promote transmissions [of 
pathogens]. The more we disturb the forests and habitats the more danger
 we are in,” he says.</p>
<p>Felicia Keesing, professor of biology at Bard College, New York, 
studies how environmental changes influence the probability that humans 
will be exposed to infectious diseases. “When we erode biodiversity, we 
see a proliferation of the species most likely to transmit new diseases 
to us, but there’s also good evidence that those same species are the 
best hosts for existing diseases,” she wrote in an email to Ensia.</p>
<h2>The Market Connection</h2>
<p>Disease ecologists argue that viruses and other pathogens are also 
likely to move from animals to humans in the many informal markets that 
have sprung up to provide fresh meat to fast-growing urban populations 
around the world. Here animals are slaughtered, cut up and sold on the 
spot.</p>
<p>The “wet market” (one that sells fresh produce and meat) in Wuhan, 
thought by the Chinese government to be the starting point of the 
current COVID-19 pandemic, was known to sell <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/24/calls-for-global-ban-wild-animal-markets-amid-coronavirus-outbreak">numerous wild animals</a>, including live wolf pups, salamanders, crocodiles, scorpions, rats, squirrels, foxes, civets and turtles.</p>
<p>Equally, urban markets in west and central Africa see monkeys, bats, 
rats and dozens of species of bird, mammal, insect and rodent 
slaughtered and sold close to open refuse dumps and with no drainage.</p>
<p>“Wet markets make a perfect storm for cross-species transmission of 
pathogens,” says Gillespie. “Whenever you have novel interactions with a
 range of species in one place, whether that is in a natural environment
 like a forest or a wet market, you can have a spillover event.”</p>
<p>The Wuhan market, along with others that sell live animals, has been 
shut by the Chinese authorities, and the government in February <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/science/coronavirus-pangolin-wildlife-ban-china.html">outlawed trading and eating wild animals</a>
 except for fish and seafood. But bans on live animals being sold in 
urban areas or informal markets are not the answer, say some scientists.</p>
<p>“The wet market in Lagos is notorious. It’s like a nuclear bomb 
waiting to happen. But it’s not fair to demonize places which do not 
have fridges. These traditional markets provide much of the food for 
Africa and Asia,” says Jones.</p>
<p>“These markets are essential sources of food for hundreds of millions
 of poor people, and getting rid of them is impossible,” says Delia 
Grace, a senior epidemiologist and veterinarian with the International 
Livestock Research Institute, which is based in Nairobi, Kenya. She 
argues that bans force traders underground, where they may pay less 
attention to hygiene.</p>
<p>Fevre and Cecilia Tacoli, principal researcher in the human 
settlements research group at the International Institute of Environment
 and Development (IIED), <a href="https://www.iied.org/coronavirus-threat-looms-large-for-low-income-cities">argue in a blog post</a> that “rather than pointing the finger at wet markets,” we should look at the burgeoning trade in wild animals.</p>
<p>“[I]t is wild animals rather than farmed animals that are the natural
 hosts of many viruses,” they write. “Wet markets are considered part of
 the informal food trade that is often blamed for contributing to 
spreading disease. But … evidence shows the link between informal 
markets and disease <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247819866124">is not always so clear cut</a>.”</p>
<h2>Changing Behavior</h2>
<p>So what, if anything, can we do about all of this?</p>
<p>Jones says that change must come from both rich and poor societies. 
Demand for wood, minerals and resources from the Global North leads to 
the degraded landscapes and ecological disruption that drives disease, 
she says. “We must think about global biosecurity, find the weak points 
and bolster the provision of health care in developing countries. 
Otherwise we can expect more of the same,” she says.</p>
<p>“The risks are greater now. They were always present and have been 
there for generations. It is our interactions with that risk which must 
be changed,” says Brian Bird, a research virologist at the University of
 California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine One Health Institute, 
where he leads Ebola-related surveillance activities in Sierra Leone and
 elsewhere.</p>
<p>“We are in an era now of chronic emergency,” Bird says. “Diseases are
 more likely to travel further and faster than before, which means we 
must be faster in our responses. It needs investments, change in human 
behavior, and it means we must listen to people at community levels.”</p>
<p>Getting the message about pathogens and disease to hunters, loggers, 
market traders and consumers is key, Bird says. “These spillovers start 
with one or two people. The solutions start with education and 
awareness. We must make people aware things are different now. I have 
learned from working in Sierra Leone with Ebola-affected people that 
local communities have the hunger and desire to have information,” he 
says. “They want to know what to do. They want to learn.”</p>
<p>Fevre and Tacoli advocate rethinking urban infrastructure, 
particularly within low-income and informal settlements. “Short-term 
efforts are focused on containing the spread of infection,” <a href="https://www.iied.org/coronavirus-threat-looms-large-for-low-income-cities">they write</a>.
 “The longer term—given that new infectious diseases will likely 
continue to spread rapidly into and within cities—calls for an overhaul 
of current approaches to urban planning and development.”</p>
<p>The bottom line, Bird says, is to be prepared. “We can’t predict 
where the next pandemic will come from, so we need mitigation plans to 
take into account the worst possible scenarios,” he says. “The only 
certain thing is that the next one will certainly come.” </p>
