<h1 class="rm-manual">How does chlorine added to drinking water kill bacteria and other harmful organisms? Why doesn't it harm us?</h1>

 J. Calomiris, Water Research Program Manager at the United States Air 
Force Research Laboratory, and Keith A. Christman, Director, 
Disinfection and Government Relations at the Chlorine Chemistry Council,
 collaborated on this answer. </p>
<p>While quenching your thirst with a glass of tap water, enjoying your 
morning shower or swimming in a pool, you most likely are, at one time 
or another, aware of the chlorine used to disinfect your municipal 
water. Although its distinctive aroma may be unpleasant to some, it is 
an indication that your water supply is being adequately treated to 
stave off harmful or deadly microorganisms. </p>
<p>Chlorine effectively kills a large variety of microbial waterborne 
pathogens, including those that can cause typhoid fever, dysentery, 
cholera and Legionnaires' disease. Chlorine is widely credited with 
virtually eliminating outbreaks of waterborne disease in the United 
States and other developed countries. And Life magazine recently cited 
the filtration of drinking water and use of chlorine as "probably the 
most significant public health advance of the millennium." </p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>

<p>TYPHOID FEVER has been virtually eliminated through the chlorination of water. </p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Health officials began treating drinking water with chlorine in 1908.
 Previously, typhoid fever had killed about 25 out of 100,000 people in 
the U.S. annually, a death rate close to that now associated with 
automobile accidents. Today, typhoid fever has been virtually 
eliminated. </p>
<p>Chlorine is currently employed by over 98 percent of all U.S. water 
utilities that disinfect drinking water. It has proved to be a powerful 
barrier in restricting pathogens from reaching your faucet and making 
you ill. Chlorine and chlorine-based compounds are the only 
disinfectants that can efficiently kill microorganisms during water 
treatment, and maintain the quality of the water as it flows from the 
treatment plant to the consumer's tap. </p>
<p>Although chlorine's value has been known for nearly a century, the 
mechanism by which the compound kills or inactivates microorganisms is 
not clearly understood. The bulk of chlorine disinfection research, 
conducted from the 1940s to the 1970s, focused on bacteria. Though 
limited, this work gave rise to some speculation. Researchers postulated
 that chlorine, which exists in water as hypochlorite and hypochlorous 
acid, reacts with biomolecules in the bacterial cell to destroy the 
organism. </p>
<p>Further work led to the so-called "multiple hit" theory of chlorine 
inactivation. It asserted that bacterial death probably results from 
chlorine attacking a variety of bacterial molecules or targets, 
including enzymes, nucleic acids and membrane lipids. </p>
<p>Early research efforts focused on how chlorine attacks enzymes. The 
disinfectant was able to inactivate extracts of various enzymes because 
it is highly reactive with sulfur-containing and aromatic amino acids. 
But it had no effect on cytoplasmic enzymes, suggesting that it might 
not reach biomolecules within the bacterium. Thus, researchers 
redirected their attention to the molecules on the surface of the 
bacterial cell. </p>
<p>A new hypothesis proclaimed that perhaps chlorine acted by attacking 
the bacterial cell wall. Proponents of this idea suggested that chlorine
 exposure might destroy the cell wall--by altering it physically, 
chemically and biochemically--and so terminate the cell's vital 
functions, killing the microorganism. </p>
<p>A possible sequence of events during chlorination would be: </p>
<li>disruption of the cell wall barrier by reactions of chlorine with target sites on the cell surface </li>
<li>release of vital cellular constituents from the cell </li>
<li>termination of membrane-associated functions </li>
<li>termination of cellular functions within the cell. <p>During the course of these events, the microorganism dies, meaning it is no longer capable of growing or causing disease. </p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>

<p>E. COLI. are commonly found in contaminated water. They are destroyed by chlorination. </p>
</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Although chlorine's disruption of the cell
 wall appears to be the fundamental event leading to the demise of the 
bacterium, the mechanism by which chlorine disrupts the cell wall had 
not been determined. Recently, though, scientists have studied how 
chlorine affects the cell walls of "gram-negative" bacteria, organisms 
including those causing typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera and 
Legionnaires' disease </p>
<p>By definition, gram-negative bacteria possess cell walls that consist
 of an outer membrane and a cytoplasmic membrane. The outer membrane, 
being the outermost region that has direct contact with the organism's 
environment, functions as a protective barrier. The investigation 
revealed that, for each bacterial species, chlorination significantly 
increased the permeability of the outer membrane, leaving the bacterium 
vulnerable to destruction. </p>
<p>How chlorine inactivates other types of bacteria has not been 
determined. Scientists do not understand much about spore-forming 
bacteria or gram-positive bacteria, which have no outer membrane. 
Although these bacterial types are, in general, more chlorine tolerant 
than gram-negative bacteria, most waterborne species do not normally 
pose a health threat. </p>
<p>Certain waterborne viruses, such as enteric viruses and hepatitis A, 
may be even more tolerant to chlorine disinfection than some bacterial 
species. But the means by which chlorine inactivates viruses is not well
 understood. </p>
<p>In recent years, the parasitic protozoans Cryptosporidium parvum and 
Giardia lamblia have emerged as formidable waterborne pathogens. These 
protozoa are remarkably resistant to chlorine disinfection and 
consequently, present a great challenge to the water industry and health
 officials, who are responsible for providing safe drinking water to the
 public. Currently, filtration is the most effective process for 
removing these protozoa from drinking water. To fully protect the 
public, however, effective disinfection methods must be developed. </p>
<p>If chlorine kills so many species of microorganisms, why doesn't it 
harm humans? Fortunately, when we ingest chlorinated drinking water, 
food in our stomachs and the materials normally present in the 
intestinal tract quickly neutralize the chlorine. So chlorine 
concentrations along cell membranes in the gastrointestinal tract are 
probably too low to cause injury. </p>
<p>This example may simply be another case of "dose makes the poison." 
Like medicine, a little bit of chlorine, such as the levels used in 
drinking water or swimming pools, kills relatively simple, but 
potentially deadly, microorganisms. At much higher concentrations, 
chlorine could damage the cells in our body. </p>
<p>Water utilities carefully regulate chlorine levels so that they 
effectively kill disease-causing microorganisms but do not harm people. 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with the help of water 
utilities, environmentalists and chlorine manufacturers, recently 
proposed a regulation that would reduce the chlorine concentrations in 
drinking water to assure that the disinfectant does not approach unsafe 
levels. </p>
<p>Some additional details are provided by Leslie E. Dorworth of the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant College Program. </p>
<p>Water has been treated for many centuries. First, it was boiled and 
filtered to improve the taste and appearance. Chlorine, one of 90 
naturally occurring elements, was first used as a disinfectant in Europe
 and North America in the early part of this century. Since then, 
widespread epidemics of the most severe forms of diseases have become 
exceedingly rare in the U.S. </p>
<p>In the U.S., Congress enacted the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974. 
The law was amended in 1986 to expand the EPA's role in protecting 
public health from contaminated drinking water. The amendments require 
the agency to control specific disease-causing organisms and indicators 
that may be present in drinking water and to require public water 
suppliers to disinfect water. Amendments enacted in 1996 make it clear 
that any federal agency is subject to penalties for past violations of 
the Act. </p>
<p>Chlorine can combine with natural organic compounds in raw water to 
create some undesirable by-products; on its own, however, it does not 
usually pose a problem to public health. The legislation regulates the 
by-products. One concern with chlorinated water is its tendency to form 
trihalomethanes (THMs), carcinogenic by-products of the disinfection 
process. In 1979, the EPA adopted the THM regulation, limiting their 
allowable level in drinking water supplies. In 1992, the EPA established
 federally enforceable standards that now cover 83 contaminants, 
including THMs, that may be found in drinking water. </p>
<p>In order to address the EPA regulations--in this case THMs 
specifically--water treatment plants changed operations to minimize THM 
production without compromising public health. Some of the methods used 
include reducing the amount of chlorine; changing the timing during 
disinfection so that chlorine is added in either sooner or later during 
process; changing the type of chlorine used; and removing the organic 
material that reacts with the chlorine to produce THMs. </p>
<p>Although chlorine is not the only disinfecting agent available to the
 water supply industry, it is the most widely used disinfectant in North
 America. Another form of disinfection is ozonation. Both chlorination 
and ozonation kill organisms by oxidation. Ultraviolet treatment, 
another method, uses UV radiation to kill microorganisms. </p>
<p>For chlorine to be effective against microorganisms, it must be 
present in a sufficient quantity, and it must have a sufficient amount 
of time to react. This reaction time is called the contact time. For 
most water systems, the best contact time is usually 30 minutes. To 
ensure continued protection against harmful organisms, a certain amount 
of chlorine must remain in the water after treatment. The remaining 
chlorine is known as a residual chlorine. It is this tiny amount that 
you sometimes smell in your tap water. </p>
<p>Most of us never think about getting sick or even dying from drinking
 water. But in many developing countries around the world, diseases 
associated with dirty water kill more than 5 million people each year, 
according to the World Health Organization. Without proper disinfection 
procedures, outbreaks in the U.S. would significantly increase. </p>
<p>As researchers and officials have learned more about water 
disinfection, the use of chlorine in treatment plants has been reduced. 
This reduction has been balanced by providing microbial protection and 
reducing the by-products created through the treatment process.</p>
