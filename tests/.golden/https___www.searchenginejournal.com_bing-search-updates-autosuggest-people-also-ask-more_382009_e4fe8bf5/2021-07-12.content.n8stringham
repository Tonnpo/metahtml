<h1 class="rm-manual">Bing Improves Key Search Features</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">Bing is rolling out several updates to improve key 
search features including autosuggest, people also ask, and intelligent 
answers.</p>

<p>Bing is improving several key search features with updates designed to provide users with a wider range of results.</p>
<p>Now, when users search using Bing, they can expect to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better autosuggest predictions</li>
<li>More ‘people also ask’ recommendations</li>
<li>Intelligent answers in more regions</li>
<li>Semantic highlighting in search snippets</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these updates are made possible due to advancements Microsoft
 has made in the areas of Natural Language Representation and Natural 
Language Generation.</p>
<p><span>Advertisement</span></p>
<p><span>Continue Reading Below</span></p>
<p>Here’s how these updates will enhance the Bing search experience going forward.</p>
<h2>Better Autosuggest Predictions</h2>
<p>A new technology called Next Phrase Prediction is being integrated into Bing’s autosuggest feature.</p>
<p>What that means for users is Bing can now provide full phrase suggestions in real time for long queries.</p>
<p>Previously, Bing’s approach to handling autosuggestions for longer 
queries was limited to completing the current word being typed by the 
user.</p>
<p>Now, Bing can generate phrase suggestions for long queries before a user starts typing the next word.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of suggestions that Bing wouldn’t have been able to show previously.</p>
<p>In addition, since phrase suggestions are being generated in 
real-time, autosuggest results are no longer limited to previously 
entered queries.</p>
<p><span>Advertisement</span></p>
<p><span>Continue Reading Below</span></p>
<p>As a result of this update, coverage of autosuggest completions 
increases considerably, which improves the overall search experience.</p>
<h2>More Questions in ‘People Also Ask’</h2>
<p>Bing can now generate question-answer pairs in the People Also Ask (PAA) block for queries that haven’t been entered before.</p>
<p>“We use a high-quality generative model on billions of documents to 
generate question-answer pairs that are present within those documents.</p>
<p>Later, when the same documents appear on the Search Engine Result 
Page (SERP), we use the previously generated question-answer pairs to 
help populate the PAA block, in addition to existing similar questions 
that have previously been asked.”</p>
<p>This update allows for greater exploration of search results by asking more questions instead of just browsing documents.</p>
<h2>Expanding Intelligent Answers</h2>
<p>Bing is expanding intelligent answers to 100 languages and 200+ regions, which covers almost every area Bing is available in.</p>
<p>Previously, Bing’s intelligent answers were only available in 13 markets.</p>
<p>Bing’s intelligent answers are similar Google’s quick answers. The 
key difference is Bing’s intelligent answers are only displayed when the
 same answer is backed up by multiple trusted sources.</p>
<p>Google’s quick answers, on the other hand, are pulled from a single source.</p>
<h2>Semantic Highlighting in Search Snippets</h2>
<p>Bing is improving search snippets in all markets with a feature called semantic highlighting.</p>
<p><span>Advertisement</span></p>
<p><span>Continue Reading Below</span></p>
<p>This feature allows Bing to highlight words in snippets beyond simple keyword matching.</p>
<p>Semantic highlighting is designed to help users find information faster without having to read through the entire snippet.</p>
<p>Previously, Bing’s ability to highlight snippets was limited to matching the exact keywords a user typed in the query.</p>
<p>“Highlighting the answer in a caption is similar to Stanford’s 
Machine Reading Comprehension test in which Microsoft was the first to 
reach human parity on the benchmark.</p>
<p>With Universal Semantic Highlighting, we can identify and highlight 
answers within captions, and do it not just for English but for all 
languages.”</p>
<p><span>Advertisement</span></p>
<p><span>Continue Reading Below</span></p>
<p>Here is an example for the query “what temperature is a fever for coronavirus.”</p>
<p>Notice how Bing doesn’t highlight the words used in the query.</p>
<p><span>Advertisement</span></p>
<p><span>Continue Reading Below</span></p>
<p>Rather, Bing highlights the answer the user is looking for (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>Expect updates similar to these in the future as Microsoft continues to make advancements in natural language processing.</p>
