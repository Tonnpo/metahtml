<p>The story Richard Clarke spins has all the suspense of a postmodern 
geopolitical thriller. The tale involves a ghostly cyberworm created to 
attack the nuclear centrifuges of a rogue nation—which then escapes from
 the target country, replicating itself in thousands of computers 
throughout the world. It may be lurking in yours right now. Harmlessly 
inactive...or awaiting further orders.</p>

<p>A great story, right? In fact, the world-changing “weaponized 
malware” computer worm called Stuxnet is very real. It seems to have 
been launched in mid-2009, done terrific damage to Iran’s nuclear 
program in 2010 and then spread to computers all over the world. Stuxnet
 may have averted a nuclear conflagration by diminishing Israel’s 
perception of a need for an imminent attack on Iran. And yet it might 
end up starting one someday soon, if its replications are manipulated 
maliciously. And at the heart of the story is a mystery: Who made and 
launched Stuxnet in the first place?</p>
<p>Richard Clarke tells me he knows the answer.</p>
<p>Clarke, who served three presidents as counterterrorism czar, now 
operates a cybersecurity consultancy called Good Harbor, located in one 
of those anonymous office towers in Arlington, Virginia, that 
triangulate the Pentagon and the Capitol in more ways than one. I had 
come to talk to him about what’s been done since the urgent alarm he’d 
sounded in his recent book, Cyber War. The book’s central argument is 
that, while the United States has developed the capability to conduct an
 offensive cyberwar, we have virtually no defense against the 
cyberattacks that he says are targeting us now, and will be in the 
future.</p>
<p>Richard Clarke’s warnings may sound overly dramatic until you 
remember that he was the man, in September of 2001, who tried to get the
 White House to act on his warnings that Al Qaeda was preparing a 
spectacular attack on American soil.</p>
<p>Clarke later delivered a famous apology to the American people in his
 testimony to the 9/11 Commission: “Your government failed you.”</p>
<p>Clarke now wants to warn us, urgently, that we are being failed 
again, being left defenseless against a cyberattack that could bring 
down our nation’s entire electronic infrastructure, including the power 
grid, banking and telecommunications, and even our military command 
system.</p>
<p>“Are we as a nation living in denial about the danger we’re in?” I 
asked Clarke as we sat across a conference table in his office suite.</p>
<p>“I think we’re living in the world of non-response. Where you know 
that there’s a problem, but you don’t do anything about it. If that’s 
denial, then that’s denial.”</p>
<p>As Clarke stood next to a window inserting coffee capsules into a 
Nespresso machine, I was reminded of the opening of one of the great 
espionage films of all time, Funeral in Berlin, in which Michael Caine 
silently, precisely, grinds and brews his morning coffee. High-tech java
 seems to go with the job.</p>
<p>But saying Clarke was a spy doesn’t do him justice. He was a 
meta-spy, a master counterespionage, counter­terrorism savant, the 
central node where all the most secret, stolen, security-encrypted bits 
of information gathered by our trillion-dollar human, electronic and 
satellite intelligence network eventually converged. Clarke has probably
 been privy to as much “above top secret”- grade espionage intelligence 
as anyone at Langley, NSA or the White House. So I was intrigued when he
 chose to talk to me about the mysteries of Stuxnet.</p>
<p>“The picture you paint in your book,” I said to Clarke, “is of a U.S.
 totally vulnerable to cyberattack. But there is no defense, really, is 
there?” There are billions of portals, trapdoors, “exploits,” as the 
cybersecurity guys call them, ready to be hacked.</p>
<p>“There isn’t today,” he agrees. Worse, he continues, catastrophic 
consequences may result from using our cyber­offense without having a 
cyberdefense: blowback, revenge beyond our imaginings.</p>
<p>“The U.S. government is involved in espionage against other 
governments,” he says flatly. “There’s a big difference, however, 
between the kind of cyberespionage the United States government does and
 China. The U.S. government doesn’t hack its way into Airbus and give 
Airbus the secrets to Boeing [many believe that Chinese hackers gave 
Boeing secrets to Airbus]. We don’t hack our way into a Chinese computer
 company like Huawei and provide the secrets of Huawei technology to 
their American competitor Cisco. [He believes Microsoft, too, was a 
victim of a Chinese cyber con game.] We don’t do that.”</p>
<p>“What do we do then?”</p>
<p>“We hack our way into foreign governments and collect the information
 off their networks. The same kind of information a CIA agent in the old
 days would try to buy from a spy.”</p>
<p>“So you’re talking about diplomatic stuff?”</p>
<p>“Diplomatic, military stuff but not commercial competitor stuff.”</p>
<p>As Clarke continued, he disclosed a belief we’re engaged in a very 
different, very dramatic new way of using our cyberoffense 
capability—the story of the legendary cyberworm, Stuxnet.</p>
<p>Stuxnet is a digital ghost, countless lines of code crafted with such
 genius that it was able to worm its way into Iran’s nuclear fuel 
enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran, where gas centrifuges spin like 
whirling dervishes, separating bomb-grade uranium-235 isotopes from the 
more plentiful U-238. Stuxnet seized the controls of the machine running
 the centrifuges and in a delicate, invisible operation, desynchronized 
the speeds at which the centrifuges spun, causing nearly a thousand of 
them to seize up, crash and otherwise self-destruct. The Natanz facility
 was temporarily shut down, and Iran’s attempt to obtain enough U-235 to
 build a nuclear weapon was delayed by what experts estimate was months 
or even years.</p>
<p>The question of who made Stuxnet and who targeted it on Natanz is 
still a much-debated mystery in the IT and espionage community. But from
 the beginning, the prime suspect has been Israel, which is known to be 
open to using unconventional tactics to defend itself against what it 
regards as an existential threat. The New York Times published a story 
that pointed to U.S.-Israeli cooperation on Stuxnet, but with Israel’s 
role highlighted by the assertion that a file buried within the Stuxnet 
worm contained an indirect reference to “Esther,” the biblical heroine 
in the struggle against the genocidal Persians.</p>
<p>Would the Israelis have been foolish enough to leave such a blatant 
signature of their authorship? Cyberweapons are usually cleansed of any 
identifying marks—the virtual equivalent of the terrorist’s “bomb with 
no return address”—so there is no sure place on which to inflict 
retaliatory consequences. Why would Israel put its signature on a 
cybervirus?</p>
<p>On the other hand, was the signature an attempt to frame the 
Israelis? On the other, other hand, was it possible the Israelis had 
indeed planted it hoping that it would lead to the conclusion that 
someone else had built it and was trying to pin it on them?</p>
<p>When you’re dealing with virtual espionage, there is really no way to know for sure who did what.</p>
<p>Unless you’re Richard Clarke.</p>
<p>“I think it’s pretty clear that the United States government did the Stuxnet attack,” he said calmly.</p>
<p>This is a fairly astonishing statement from someone in his position.</p>
<p>“Alone or with Israel?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I think there was some minor Israeli role in it. Israel might have 
provided a test bed, for example. But I think that the U.S. government 
did the attack and I think that the attack proved what I was saying in 
the book [which came out before the attack was known], which is that you
 can cause real devices—real hardware in the world, in real space, not 
cyberspace—to blow up.”</p>
<p>Isn’t Clarke coming right out and saying we committed an act of undeclared war?</p>
<p>“If we went in with a drone and knocked out a thousand centrifuges, 
that’s an act of war,” I said. “But if we go in with Stuxnet and knock 
out a thousand centrifuges, what’s that?”</p>
<p>“Well,” Clarke replied evenly, “it’s a covert action. And the U.S. 
government has, ever since the end of World War II, before then, engaged
 in covert action. If the United States government did Stuxnet, it was 
under a covert action, I think, issued by the president under his powers
 under the Intelligence Act. Now when is an act of war an act of war and
 when is it a covert action?</p>
<p>“That’s a legal issue. In U.S. law, it’s a covert action when the 
president says it’s a covert action. I think if you’re on the receiving 
end of the covert action, it’s an act of war.”</p>
<p>When I e-mailed the White House for comment, I received this reply: 
“You are probably aware that we don’t comment on classified intelligence
 matters.” Not a denial. But certainly not a confirmation. So what does 
Clarke base his conclusion on?</p>
<p>One reason to believe the Stuxnet attack was made in the USA, Clarke 
says, “was that it very much had the feel to it of having been written 
by or governed by a team of Washington lawyers.”</p>
<p>“What makes you say that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Well, first of all, I’ve sat through a lot of meetings with 
Washington [government/Pentagon/CIA/NSA-type] lawyers going over covert 
action proposals. And I know what lawyers do.</p>
<p>“The lawyers want to make sure that they very much limit the effects 
of the action. So that there’s no collateral damage.” He is referring to
 legal concerns about the Law of Armed Conflict, an international code 
designed to minimize civilian casualties that U.S. government lawyers 
seek to follow in most cases.</p>
<p>Clarke illustrates by walking me through the way Stuxnet took down the Iranian centrifuges.</p>
<p>“What does this incredible Stuxnet thing do? As soon as it gets into 
the network and wakes up, it verifies it’s in the right network by 
saying, ‘Am I in a network that’s running a SCADA [Supervisory Control 
and Data Acquisition] software control system?’ ‘Yes.’ Second question: 
‘Is it running Siemens [the German manufacturer of the Iranian plant 
controls]?’ ‘Yes.’ Third question: ‘Is it running Siemens 7 [a genre of 
software control package]?’ ‘Yes.’ Fourth question: ‘Is this software 
contacting an electrical motor made by one of two companies?’” He 
pauses.</p>
<p>“Well, if the answer to that was ‘yes,’ there was only one place it could be. Natanz.”</p>
<p>“There are reports that it’s gotten loose, though,” I said, reports 
of Stuxnet worms showing up all over the cyberworld. To which Clarke has
 a fascinating answer:</p>
<p>“It got loose because there was a mistake,” he says. “It’s clear to 
me that lawyers went over it and gave it what’s called, in the IT 
business, a TTL.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“If you saw Blade Runner [in which artificial intelligence androids 
were given a limited life span—a “time to die”], it’s a ‘Time to Live.’”
 Do the job, commit suicide and disappear. No more damage, collateral or
 otherwise.</p>
<p>“So there was a TTL built into Stuxnet,” he says [to avoid violating 
international law against collateral damage, say to the Iranian 
electrical grid]. And somehow it didn’t work.”</p>
<p>“Why wouldn’t it have worked?”</p>
<p>“TTL operates off of a date on your computer. Well, if you are in 
China or Iran or someplace where you’re running bootleg software that 
you haven’t paid for, your date on your computer might be 1998 or 
something because otherwise the bootleg 30-day trial TTL software would 
expire.</p>
<p>“So that’s one theory,” Clarke continues. “But in any event, you’re 
right, it got out. And it ran around the world and infected lots of 
things but didn’t do any damage, because every time it woke up in a 
computer it asked itself those four questions. Unless you were running 
uranium nuclear centrifuges, it wasn’t going to hurt you.”</p>
<p>“So it’s not a threat anymore?”</p>
<p>“But you now have it, and if you’re a computer whiz you can take it 
apart and you can say, ‘Oh, let’s change this over here, let’s change 
that over there.’ Now I’ve got a really sophisticated weapon. So 
thousands of people around the world have it and are playing with it. 
And if I’m right, the best cyberweapon the United States has ever 
developed, it then gave the world for free.”</p>
<p>The vision Clarke has is of a modern technological nightmare, casting
 the United States as Dr. Frankenstein, whose scientific genius has 
created millions of potential monsters all over the world. But Clarke is
 even more concerned about “official” hackers such as those believed to 
be employed by China.</p>
<p>“I’m about to say something that people think is an exaggeration, but
 I think the evidence is pretty strong,” he tells me. “Every major 
company in the United States has already been penetrated by China.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The British government actually said [something similar] about their own country. ”</p>
<p>Clarke claims, for instance, that the manufacturer of the F-35, our 
next-generation fighter bomber, has been penetrated and F-35 details 
stolen. And don’t get him started on our supply chain of chips, routers 
and hardware we import from Chinese and other foreign suppliers and what
 may be implanted in them—“logic bombs,” trapdoors and “Trojan horses,” 
all ready to be activated on command so we won’t know what hit us. Or 
what’s already hitting us.</p>
<p>“My greatest fear,” Clarke says, “is that, rather than having a 
cyber-Pearl Harbor event, we will instead have this death of a thousand 
cuts. Where we lose our competitiveness by having all of our research 
and development stolen by the Chinese. And we never really see the 
single event that makes us do something about it. That it’s always just 
below our pain threshold. That company after company in the United 
States spends millions, hundreds of millions, in some cases billions of 
dollars on R&amp;D and that information goes free to China....After a 
while you can’t compete.”</p>
<p>But Clarke’s concerns reach beyond the cost of lost intellectual 
property. He foresees the loss of military power. Say there was another 
confrontation, such as the one in 1996 when President Clinton rushed two
 carrier battle fleets to the Taiwan Strait to warn China against an 
invasion of Taiwan. Clarke, who says there have been war games on 
precisely such a revived confrontation, now believes that we might be 
forced to give up playing such a role for fear that our carrier group 
defenses could be blinded and paralyzed by Chinese cyberintervention. 
(He cites a recent war game published in an influential military 
strategy journal called Orbis titled “How the U.S. Lost the Naval War of
 2015.”)</p>
<p>Talking to Clarke provides a glimpse into the brand-new game of 
geopolitics, a dangerous and frightening new paradigm. With the advent 
of “weaponized malware” like Stuxnet, all previous military and much 
diplomatic strategy has to be comprehensively reconceived—and time is 
running out.</p>
<p>I left Clarke’s office feeling that we are at a moment very much like
 the summer of 2001, when Clarke made his last dire warning. “A couple 
people have labeled me a Cassandra,” Clarke says. “And I’ve gone back 
and read my mythology about Cassandra. And the way I read the mythology,
 it’s pretty clear that Cassandra was right.”</p>
<p>Editors Note, March 23, 2012: This story has been modified to clarify
 that the Natanz facility was only temporarily shut down and that the 
name “Esther” was only indirectly referenced in the Stuxnet worm.</p>
