<p class="rm-manual">U.S President Donald Trump</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Joshua Roberts/ REUTERS</span> </p>
<p>Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/thema/united_states_en/">United States</a>. He does not possess the requisite intellect and does <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/clinton-campaign-chair-john-podesta-on-president-trump-a-1146317.html">not understand the significance of the office he holds</a>
 nor the tasks associated with it. He doesn't read. He doesn't bother to
 peruse important files and intelligence reports and knows little about 
the issues that he has identified as his priorities. His decisions are 
capricious and they are delivered in the form of tyrannical decrees.</p>
<p>He is a man free of morals. As has been demonstrated hundreds of 
times, he is a liar, a racist and a cheat. I feel ashamed to use these 
words, as sharp and loud as they are. But if they apply to anyone, they 
apply to <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/thema/donald_trump_en/">Trump</a>.
 And one of the media's tasks is to continue telling things as they are:
 Trump has to be removed from the White House. Quickly. He is a danger 
to the world.</p>
<p>Trump is a miserable politician. He fired the FBI director simply 
because he could. James Comey had gotten under his skin with his 
investigation into Trump's confidants. Comey had also refused to swear 
loyalty and fealty to Trump and to abandon the investigation. He had to 
go.</p>
<p> Witnessing an American Tragedy </p>
<p>Trump is also a miserable boss. His people invent excuses for him and
 lie on his behalf because they have to, but then Trump wakes up and 
posts tweets that contradict what they have said. He doesn't care that 
his spokesman, his secretary of state and his national security adviser 
had just denied that the president had handed Russia (of all countries) 
sensitive intelligence gleaned from Israel (of all countries). Trump 
tweeted: Yes, yes, I did, because I can. I'm president after all.</p>
<p>Nothing is as it should be in this White House. Everyone working 
there has been compromised multiple times and now they all despise each 
other - and everyone except for Trump despises Trump. Because of all 
that, after just 120 days of the Trump administration, we are witness to
 an American tragedy for which there are five theoretical solutions.</p>
<p>The first is Trump's resignation, which won't happen. The second is 
that Republicans in the House and Senate support impeachment, which 
would be justified by the president's proven obstruction of justice, but
 won't happen because of the Republicans' thirst for power, which they 
won't willingly give up. The third possible solution is the invocation 
of the 25th Amendment, which would require the cabinet to declare Trump 
unfit to discharge the powers of the presidency. That isn't particularly
 likely either. Fourth: The Democrats get ready to fight and win back 
majorities in the House and Senate in midterm elections, which are 18 
months away, before they then pursue option two, impeachment. Fifth: the
 international community wakes up and finds a way to circumvent the 
White House and free itself of its dependence on the U.S. Unlike the 
preceding four options, the fifth doesn't directly solve the Trump 
problem, but it is nevertheless necessary - and possible.</p>
<p> No Goals and No Strategy </p>
<p>Not quite two weeks ago, a number of experts and politicians focused 
on foreign policy met in Washington at the invitation of the Munich 
Security Conference. It wasn't difficult to sense the atmosphere of 
chaos and agony that has descended upon the city.</p>

<p>The U.S. elected a laughing stock to the presidency and has now made 
itself dependent on a joke of a man. The country is, as David Brooks 
wrote recently in <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/trump-and-the-new-york-times-a-love-hate-relationship-a-1145096.html">the New York Times</a>,
 dependent on a child. The Trump administration has no foreign policy 
because Trump has consistently promised American withdrawal while 
invoking America's strength. He has promised both no wars and more wars.
 He makes decisions according to his mood, with no strategic coherence 
or tactical logic. Moscow and Beijing are laughing at America. 
Elsewhere, people are worried.</p>
<p>In the Pacific, warships - American and Chinese - circle each other 
in close proximity. The conflict with North Korea is escalating. Who can
 be certain that Donald Trump won't risk nuclear war simply to save his 
own skin? Efforts to stop climate change are in trouble and many expect 
the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Agreement because Trump is wary of 
legally binding measures. Crises, including those in Syria and Libya, 
are escalating, but no longer being discussed. And who should they be 
discussed with? Phone calls and emails to the U.S. State Department go 
unanswered. Nothing is regulated, nothing is stable and the <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/angela-merkel-hits-her-stride-as-german-campaign-begins-a-1146307.html">trans-Atlantic relationship</a>
 hardly exists anymore. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and 
Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Norbert Röttgen fly back and 
forth, but Germany and the U.S. no longer understand each other. Hardly 
any real communication takes place, there are no joint foreign policy 
goals and there is no strategy.</p>
<p>In "Game of Thrones," the Mad King was murdered (and the child that 
later took his place was no better). In real life, an immature boy sits 
on the throne of the most important country in the world. He could, at 
any time, issue a catastrophic order that would immediately be carried 
out. That is why the parents cannot afford to take their eyes off him 
even for a second. They cannot succumb to exhaustion because he is so 
taxing. They ultimately have to send him to his room - and return power 
to the grownups.</p>
