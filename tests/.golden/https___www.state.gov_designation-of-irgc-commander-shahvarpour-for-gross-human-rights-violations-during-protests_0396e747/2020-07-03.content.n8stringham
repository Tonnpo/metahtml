<p class="rm-manual">Press Statement</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Department of State designated Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps (IRGC) Brigadier General Hassan Shahvarpour, Khuzestan 
Province’s Vali Asr Commander, for his involvement in gross violations 
of human rights against protestors during the November protests in 
Mahshahr, Iran. According to multiple media reports and information 
submitted by the Iranian people through the Department of State’s 
Rewards for Justice tip-line, IRGC units under Shahvarpour’s command 
killed as many as 148 Iranians when they encircled fleeing protestors in
 armored vehicles, firing machine guns into the crowd and lighting fire 
to the marsh in which the protestors took cover.</p>
<p>This U.S. action is taken pursuant to Section 7031(c) of the 
Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act, 2020, making ineligible for entry into the United 
States officials of foreign governments and their immediate family 
members for whom the Secretary of State has credible information on 
their involvement in gross violations of human rights. It demonstrates 
the United States’ continued commitment to the Iranian people to support
 their demands for accountability from Iranian officials who committed 
serious human rights abuses against protestors in November 2019.</p>
<p>During the November 2019 violent suppression of protests, the Iranian
 regime violated the rights to life and of peaceful assembly enshrined 
in Articles 6 and 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR), which the regime signed and ratified in 1975.</p>
<p>The United States has heard the Iranian people, collected information
 submitted by ordinary Iranians through the Rewards for Justice 
tip-line, followed the evidence, and has taken action against this 
abusive official whose actions are only one example of the many reported
 human rights violations which were perpetrated during the country-wide 
protests of November 2019 in Iran.</p>
