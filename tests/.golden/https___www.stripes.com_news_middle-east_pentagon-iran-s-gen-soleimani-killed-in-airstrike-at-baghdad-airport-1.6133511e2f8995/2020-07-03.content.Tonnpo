<p>OFFICE OF THE IRANIAN SUPREME LEADER </p>
<p class="">By CHAD GARLAND | STARS AND STRIPES <span>Published: January 2, 2020</span></p>
<p> IRBIL, Iraq — Iran’s Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of the nation’s 
elite Quds Force, was killed in a drone strike early Friday at Baghdad 
International Airport, the U.S. military said.</p>
<p> “At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken 
decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing 
[Qassem] Soleimani,” the Pentagon said in a statement. “Soleimani was 
actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service 
members in Iraq and throughout the region.”</p>
<p> Also reportedly killed was Abu Mahdi Muhandis, a senior leader of a 
paramilitary wing of Iraq’s security forces and founder of Kataeb 
Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Shiite militia group with a long history of 
fighting American forces in Iraq. The Pentagon blamed the group for a 
deadly strike in Kirkuk that killed a U.S. civilian contractor last 
week.</p>
<p> Defense Department officials accused Soleimani of orchestrating last
 week's Kirkuk attack, as well as many others in recent months that have
 killed and wounded both American and coalition service members.</p>
<p> Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed the deaths in a statement to the country’s state-owned Tasnim news agency.</p>
<p> Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared three days of 
mourning for Soleimani’s death, stating “severe revenge awaits the 
criminals who bloodied their foul hands with his blood and other 
martyrs’ in last night’s incident,” according to news reports.</p>
<p> Powerful Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr issued a statement on 
Twitter giving orders to revive the anti-American Mahdi Army, which 
along with Kataeb Hezbollah had been a major destabilizing force 
targeting American and coalition troops after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
 The group was dissolved more than a decade ago, but Sadr called on its 
fighters and others to “be ready.”</p>
<p> The attack reportedly happened at about 1 a.m. Social media users 
said they heard explosions, followed by sounds of military aircraft.</p>
<p> The strike was confirmed about 45 minutes later by the Iraqi 
government’s security information cell, which posted photos of burning 
vehicles near the airport on its Facebook page, attributing the damage 
to a rocket attack.</p>
<p> Seven people were killed in Friday's strike, an official with an Iran-backed paramilitary force told The Associated Press.</p>
<p> Early media reports said the attack was an airstrike that killed 
Mohammed Redha, a senior member of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units — 
an umbrella group of paramilitary forces that Muhandis was deputy 
commander of, and which included Kataeb Hezbollah and other Iran-backed 
militias, as well as other groups that have fought the Islamic State 
group since 2014.</p>
<p> Observers warned that Soleimani’s death could lead to dramatic 
escalation in the region, where tension between Washington and Tehran 
has been mounting for months.</p>
<p> “Soleimani had cult hero status within IRGC and among Shia militias 
in the region, and was personally the most popular regime figure in 
#Iran,” tweeted Vali R. Nasr, professor of Middle East Studies and 
International Affairs at Johns Hopkins University. “The pressure to 
retaliate will be immense.”</p>
<p> A State Department security alert Friday urged all Americans to 
leave Iraq immediately due to the “heightened tensions in Iraq and the 
region,” reiterating an advisory issued Wednesday after Iran-backed 
militias attacked the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad.</p>
<p> The militia members breached the embassy gates on New Year’s Eve, 
withdrawing from the area the next day after a contingent of about 100 
Marines arrived from Kuwait to bolster the diplomatic compound’s 
security.</p>
<p> The attack on Soleimani came hours after Defense Secretary Mark Esper urged Iran and its proxies to stand down.</p>
<p> “We will not accept continued attacks against our personnel and 
forces,” he said in a statement Thursday. “Attacks against us will be 
met with responses in the time, manner, and place of our choosing.”</p>
<p> Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., questioned the killing of Soleimani in a
 tweet before the Pentagon issued its statement confirming the general's
 death.</p>
<p> “Did America just assassinate, without any congressional 
authorization, the second most powerful person in Iran, knowingly 
setting off a potential massive regional war?” he wrote.</p>
<p> Soleimani’s Quds Force trains, funds and equips Iranian proxy 
groups, including Kataeb Hezbollah and others that fought American 
forces after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Both the Quds Force and Kataeb 
Hezbollah are U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations.</p>
<p> After rocket attacks on bases housing American troops in early 
December — some of the 11 carried out in the past two months that have 
mostly wounded Iraqis — U.S. officials called on the Iraqi government to
 do more to prevent them and warned of decisive action if they 
continued.</p>
<p> Then, last Friday, a barrage of rockets hit the K1 base in Kirkuk, 
killing an American civilian contractor and wounding four U.S. and two 
Iraqi service members. The Defense Department countered with airstrikes 
targeting five Kataeb Hezbollah sites in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p> The air raids killed at least 25 and wounded dozens more, which spurred the U.S. Embassy militia attack.</p>
<p> “General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in 
Baghdad,” the Pentagon said in its statement confirming the attack that 
killed him. “This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack 
plans.”</p>
<p> Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi, whom Esper had warned of the 
strikes on Kataeb Hezbollah shortly before they were carried out, 
criticized the Pentagon’s strikes as a violation of the country’s 
sovereignty.</p>
<p> Mahdi, who is acting in a caretaker role after recently resigning 
his post, called for a review of Iraq’s relationship with the United 
States. Iran-backed militia groups also promised to press the Iraqi 
parliament to move to evict the U.S., which has been aiding Iraq in the 
fight against ISIS.</p>
<p> The U.S. has sent roughly 14,000 troops to the Middle East since 
last summer. In response to the embassy siege, Esper ordered some 750 
infantry troops from the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division to deploy to the 
region.</p>
<p> The first wave of the troops from the 82nd Airborne’s 1st Brigade 
Combat Team departed Thursday. More would be on standby to deploy in the
 coming days, Esper said.</p>
<p> “The United States will continue to take all necessary action to 
protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the 
world,” the Pentagon said early Friday.</p>
