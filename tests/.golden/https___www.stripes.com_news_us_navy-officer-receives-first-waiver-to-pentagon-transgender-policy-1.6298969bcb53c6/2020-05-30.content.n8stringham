<p class="rm-manual">By CAITLIN M. KENNEY | STARS AND STRIPES <span>Published: May 15, 2020</span></p>
<p> WASHINGTON — A transgender Navy officer is now permitted to serve 
openly as her preferred gender, the first such waiver since April 2019 
when a Pentagon policy began to restrict transgender individuals in the 
military.</p>
<p> The acting Navy Secretary James McPherson approved the waiver to the
 transgender policy in this individual case, Lt. Brittany Stephens, a 
Navy spokeswoman, said in a statement. </p>
<p> “This service member requested a waiver to serve in their preferred 
gender, to include obtaining a gender marker change in the Defense 
Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System and being allowed to adhere to 
standards associated with their preferred gender, such as uniforms and 
grooming," Stephens said.</p>
<p> The Pentagon’s policy does not allow the vast majority of men and 
women who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria to enlist in the 
military or continue to serve as the person’s preferred gender without a
 waiver. Gender dysphoria is the medical condition associated with 
individuals who do not identify with their birth sex.</p>
<p> The policy overturned a 2016 policy from former President Barack 
Obama’s administration that allowed transgender service members to serve
 openly. Transgender service members in the military at the time that 
the 2019 policy was enacted were grandfathered in to the new policy and 
were not subjected to its requirements.</p>
<p> The Defense Department has stated it based the policy change on data
 gathered during a 2017 study of transgender troops that showed their 
service brought “substantial risks” to the military, such as affecting 
readiness and burdening the military with additional costs. The 
department has declined to make any of that data public or describe it 
in detail.</p>
<p> It remains unclear precisely how many servicemembers on active duty 
identify as transgender. A 2016 Defense Department survey, which was 
anonymous, found about 9,000 servicemembers identified themselves as 
transgender men or women, said Tony Kurta, who was performing the duties
 of the deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness in 
April 2019 when the new Pentagon policy went into effect. Some 1,400 
troops have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria since the 2016 policy 
was implemented, he said at that time.</p>
<p> In a joint statement Friday, GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders 
and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, legal organizations for 
LGBTQ rights and advocacy, said they had filed a lawsuit in March on 
behalf of the Navy officer who received the waiver. The government was 
going to file a response to the lawsuit next week, according to the 
statement.</p>
<p> "While we are relieved that our client, a highly qualified Naval 
officer, will be able to continue her service, there are other equally 
qualified transgender service members who have sought waivers and are 
still in limbo, despite being perfectly fit to serve,” Jennifer Levi, 
the director of GLAD’s Transgender Rights Project, said in the prepared 
statement.</p>
<p> The Navy officer, who has served two extended tours of duty in nine 
years, is seeking emergency relief from the policy in order to continue 
serving, according to a news release about the lawsuit. She had come out
 after the April 2019 policy was put into effect and needed a waiver to 
continue serving.</p>
<p> Requiring transgender service members to seek a waiver to serve is 
discriminatory, NCLR Legal Director Shannon Minter said in the 
statement.</p>
<p> “Being transgender has nothing to do with a person’s fitness to 
serve, and transgender individuals should be held to the same standards 
as other service members,” Minter said.</p>
<p> The waiver “is an important victory for this sailor,” Peter 
Perkowski, the legal and policy director for the Modern Military 
Association of America, a LGBTQ non-profit, said in a statement.</p>
<p> “Over the past year, we’ve continued to hear from qualified 
transgender patriots who want to serve their country but can’t because 
of the Trump-Pence transgender military ban,” Perkowski said. “As our 
nation faces unprecedented challenges, the last thing our military 
should be doing is rejecting qualified individuals who want to serve 
simply because of their gender identity.”</p>
<p class=""> Modern Military Association of America represents six 
service members in a lawsuit challenging whether the ban is 
constitutional, according to the statement.</p>
