<p>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was an Iranian Shia cleric who led a 
revolution that toppled the last king of Iran. He is considered the 
founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>
<h2 class="">Early Life</h2>
<p>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was born in Khomeyn, Iran on September 
24, 1902. His parents named him Ruhollah Mousavi Khomeini at birth. He 
was the son of Sayed Moustafa Hindi and his wife Haijeh Agha Khanum. His
 father died in 1907 leaving Khomeini in the custody of his mother. As a
 child, he became an avid sportsman and academician in school. He 
excelled in the local religious competitions during the recitation of 
the Quran verses.</p>
<p>He became the disciple of the prominent cleric Ayatollah Abdul Karim 
Yazdi. Khomeini followed Yazdi to the religious city of Qom when the 
elder cleric migrated. He continued his studies in classical poetry, 
philosophy, and Islamic law. In Qom, he studied under two prominent 
clerics Ayatollah Yazdi and Husayn Borujerdi. Both clerics taught of the
 separation of religion and state politics.</p>
<p>Khomeini loathed the ideology of non-interference with politics. 
Unable to challenge his seniors in religion, he decided to teach 
religion Qom. He taught Islamic history, political philosophy. He 
created a radical following among his students who later formed the base
 of his revolution.</p>
<h2>Radical Activist</h2>
<p>In 1961, Grand Ayatollah Borujerdi died. Khomeini moved up to fill 
the vacuum left by the departed cleric. He became an idol figure within 
the top clerics in Qom. He departed from the tradition of his 
predecessors. Khomeini emphasized on the jurisprudence of religion over 
every aspect of life. In 1962 he organized the first cleric-led protest 
in Iran. He created the college of religious scholars who led the 
opposition to the king or Shah Rezaâ€™s westernization of the Iranian 
society.</p>
<p>Khomeini accused the Shah of abandoning the Iranian culture and 
Islamic tradition for the western ideals that considered the Iranians as
 slaves. He labeled the Shah as corrupt and sympathetic to the Zionists.
 The shah imprisoned him in June 1963. Riots erupted in the country with
 demands of his release. The rioters were brutally pacified by the 
Iranian military. Khomeini got out of prison in 1964 and sent to Qom.</p>
<h2>Islamic Revolution</h2>
<p>He continued delivering fiery speeches against the Shah of Iran. When
 diplomatic efforts were thwarted, the Iranian authorities sent him to 
exile. Khomeini went to Turkey. He could not practice his fiery 
religious tenets or dress as a cleric in secular Turkey. He left Turkey 
and settled in the Shia city of Najaf in Iraq. He taught the Iranian 
population in Najaf of his new ideology. Khomeini smuggled his fiery 
speeches in videotapes into Iran.</p>
<p>Shah Reza pleaded with the Iraqi authorities to contain Khomeini. 
Khomeini was given two options, either denounce his political activities
 or leave Najaf. He chose to leave Iraq for Paris in 1978. As the 
military became passive on the demonstrators, Shah Reza abdicated his 
throne and went to the US.</p>
<h2>Supreme Leader</h2>
<p>On February 1, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Iran as the 
triumphant leader of the revolution. He became the unanimous leader of 
the nation and established the Islamic Republic of Iran. He officiated 
over the writing of the new Islamic constitution and pacified his 
opponents. He filled government positions with clerics sympathetic to 
his ideology. Khomeini became the Supreme Leader of Iran by law.</p>
<p>Khomeini demanded the return of the Shah to Iran to stand trial. Shah
 Reza left Europe for his exile in the US. In response, university 
students in the capital Tehran broke into the US embassy and took 52 
Americans hostage. The stalemate stayed for 444 days and was resolved by
 the new US president Ronald Reagan in 1981.</p>
<p>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, an Arab Sunni Muslim and traditional 
foe of the Persian Iran, decided to capitalize on the turmoil in Iran. 
He invaded Iran in June 1982. Khomeini managed to repulse the attack 
resulting in a six-year war between the two countries. The United 
Nations brokered a ceasefire deal that ended the war in August 1988. 
Both nations suffered massive human casualties.</p>
<p>During his administration, Iran transformed into a conservative 
Islamic nation. He introduced an Islamic dress code, institutionalized 
the Islamic Law in all jurisprudence, and banned alcohol. He also 
outlawed western films and aligned the education system to Islam. He 
pacified his opponents with prison, exile or death.</p>
<h2>Fatwa</h2>
<p>In 1989, the Indian-British author published the controversial book 
The Satanic Verses. Rushdie condemned some Islamic practices and 
vilified the Islamic Prophet Muhammad as a false prophet. He attracted 
condemnation across the Islamic world. Ayatollah Khomeini decreed a 
death sentence or Fatwa on the writer. In essence, any Muslim became 
duty bound by the decree to kill Rushdie.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p class="">On June 3, 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini died in Tehran. He left 
behind a widow and five children. Despite his death, the ideology of the
 Islamic revolution outlived leader fondly remembered as Imam Khomeini.</p>
