<p>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was a religious scholar who transformed 
Iran with his combination of political and religious views. After 
returning from exile, Khomeini became head of a government that he 
claimed was of God. Iranians still revere Khomeini as a great leader and
 pay homage to his grave on the anniversary of his death.</p>
<p>1. Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini (1902-1989) was the founder and
 supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He took office in 1979 
and was the only leader in the Muslim world who combined political and 
religious as the supreme leader.</p>
<p>2. Khomeini spent the first part of his childhood training, teaching 
and writing in the field of Islamic studies. At the age of six, he began
 to study the Koran. His older brother taught him Islamic jurisprudence.
 His writings throughout his secular and religious lessons revealed that
 he firmly believed in the need for clerics to be politically active.</p>
<p>3. Khomeini was the first Iranian cleric to try to refute secularism 
in the 1940s. He did this in his book, Kashf-e Assrar (Discovery of 
Secrets). The book was written to dispute points made in a book by a 
disciple of Iran’s leading anti-clerical historian at the time.</p>
<p>4. Because Khomeini believed that the government was an un-Islamic 
and illegitimate institution, he launched his crusade against the shah’s
 regime in 1962. This crusade lead to rebellion and made for a turning 
point in the history of the Islamic movement in Iran.</p>
<p>5. “The White Revolution” was the name given to Muhammad (Mohammad) 
Reza Shah’s political movement. Khomeini denounced this legislation for 
the reason that it conflicted with Islamic values.</p>
<p>6. The rise of the Shah lead to the exile of Khomeini in 1964 after 
he was arrested first in the June riots of 1963 and for a second time 
after an anti-American movement in 1964. He was exiled to Iraq and then 
to France until 1979.</p>
<p>7. Khomeini returned to Iran from exile on February 1, 1979. Ten days
 later revolutionary forces allied to Khomeini, who seized power in 
Iran. Khomeini then became the founder and the supreme leader of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. During his reign, Khomeini was focused on 
“engineering an ideal Islamic society in Iran.” Three periods of 
revolution transpired during the time of Khomeini’s appointment.</p>
<p>8. Foreign policy was the topic of the second of the two Khomeini 
revolutions. U.S. and Iran relations were destroyed following a 
confession by one in Khomeini’s group that Khomeini’s instruction to 
Iranian students was to “expand with all their might their attacks 
against the United States.” As a result, the American embassy was seized
 on Nov. 4, 1979 and there were 444 days of dispute between the United 
States and Iran before the hostages were finally released.</p>
<p>9. Khomeini was consumed by his desire to create the ideal Islamic 
Republic of Iran. He dismissed any leaders who threatened to take his 
power or this dream away from him. It was on April 1, 1979, that 
Khomeini felt that the ideal Islamic Republic of Iran had finally been 
formed and he is quoted as calling this day, “the first day of the 
Government of God.”</p>
<p>10. In 1988, Khomeini and Iran accepted the United Nation’s call for a
 cease-fire with Iraq. Before Khomeini died of cancer in 1989 he 
designated President Ali Khamenei to succeed him.</p>
