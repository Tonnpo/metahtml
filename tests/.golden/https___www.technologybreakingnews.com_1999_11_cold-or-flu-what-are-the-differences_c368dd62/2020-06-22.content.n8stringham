<p>Both flu (influenza) and cold are caused by viruses, and they can

article published in The Lancet. Every year, 5-20 percent of the

cold and flu is that, generally, symptoms of the flu are usually a lot 
more severe. Each year, more than 200,000 people are hospitalized 
because of flu complications; flu is responsible for around 23,600 
deaths every year. Cold and flu are caused by different viruses, and, in
 general, the symptoms of flu are worse. Also, there are less likely to 
be serious complications from cold, such as pneumonia and bacterial 
infections. The main difference between cold and flu symptoms is that 
flu more commonly includes fever; the fever can be 100 degrees 
Fahrenheit or higher and last for 3-5 days. The extreme fatigue 
associated with flu can persist for weeks. Cold symptoms are generally 
milder and last about 1 week. Also, runny nose or nasal congestion is 
more common… <a href="file:///go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNTE2MS5waHA=" rel="nofollow">Read full this story</a></p>
