<p><span>T</span>he Oscars never fails to provide an unparalleled level 
of red carpet glamour. No where more so than with the hair and make-up 
looks.</p>
<p>"There are months and months of work that go behind these looks," 
Emma Stone's make-up artist and Nars Cosmetics director of pro artistry 
and red carpet, Rachel Goodwin tells The Telegraph. “It’s the biggest, 
most high-pressured day for women. The Oscars is the red carpet; it’s 
the one that everyone compares all the other ones to."</p>
<p>It's unsurprising then that the beauty looks often feel unattainable 
to us mere mortals. And yet, thanks to a rising numbers of experts 
taking to social media to share their tricks of the trade, it's become 
clear that some of the Oscar 2017 red carpet beauty tricks aren't as 
complicated as you'd think... </p>
<h4>The loose powder lip trick</h4>
<p> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ_3KvbjEN5/">Painting some 
brick lips on this goddess tonight. #emmastone you couldn't be more 
beautiful if you tried. Audacious Lipstick in Mona by NARS #narsissist

<p><span>W</span>hile a statement lipstick might look good on the red 
carpet, celebrities often opt for a smoky eye instead so they don’t have
 to worry about the colour fading or smudging before the ceremony is 
over.</p>
<p>Goodwin had a solution for this dilemma when prepping Emma Stone's bold lip colour. “I layered <a href="https://narscosmetics.co.uk/en_GB/mona-audacious-lipstick/0607845094975.html" rel="nofollow">Nars Audacious Lipstick in Mona, £25</a>,
 blotted it with loose powder and then layered it again and then loose 
powder,” Goodwin told The Telegraph. “I did a combination of things to 
create a strong base for her lip colour because I wanted to make sure it
 didn’t fade at all.”</p>
<h4>The £2.99 hair must-haves</h4>

<p><span>M</span>ost of the up-dos seen on the red carpet rely on 
several products and are virtually impossible to recreate at home on 
yourself. But for Dakota Johnson’s chic knotted half-up, half-down look,
 hairstylist Mark Townsend employed just two products: Dove’s Extra Hold
 Hairspray - this isn’t available in the UK, but Elnett is equally as 
good - and <a href="http://www.boots.com/scunci-comfort-no-slip-grip-brown-24-10211815" rel="nofollow">Scunci Hair Grips, £2.99</a>. He simply twisted sections of the hair and pinned in place. </p>

<p><span>S</span>heet masks have been an Instagram favourite among 
celebrities for a couple of years now and last night Thandie Newton 
revealed her mask of choice. The actress posted a snap of her wearing a <a href="http://repiderme.com/shop-2/" rel="nofollow">Repiderme </a>sheet mask in the hours before the Oscars.</p>
<p>It's well known that hydrated skin looks fresher, plumper and firmer. For a similarly hydrating formula, look to <a href="https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/farmacy-hydrating-coconut-gel-mask-brightening-purple-broccoli.html" rel="nofollow">Farmacy Hydrating Coconut Gel Mask, £8</a>, and <a href="http://uk.erborian.com/bamboo_shot_mask,7,1,471,19702.htm#s=362" rel="nofollow">Erborian Bamboo Shot Mask, £6</a>.</p>

<p><span>M</span>ake-up artist Ashunta Sheriff proved that there is more than one use for your self-tan. Sheriff used<a href="http://www.sttropeztan.co.uk/instant-tan-finishing-gloss-100ml/" rel="nofollow"> St Tropez Instant Tan Finishing Gloss, £12</a>,
 to not only bronze, but also contour Taraji P. Henson’s decolletage and
 arms just before she hit the red carpet. “Taraji is a firm believer in 
‘less is more’, so we didn’t want to overcomplicate or overthink 
anything,” Sheriff said. The gloss was applied where the light would 
naturally hit and is a great tip to employ if you want to enhance, or 
fake, sculpted limbs.</p>
<h4>The classic lash secret</h4>

<p class=""><span>W</span>hether you're layering on mascara or enlisting
 the help of false lashes, Heidi Klum proves that curling your natural 
lashes beforehand is imperative to ensuring they are red-carpet-worthy. 
Look to <a href="http://www.libertylondon.com/uk/relevee-lash-curler-1001501475.html?dwvar_406823_color=98-NO%20COLOUR&amp;referrer=brands#start=1" rel="nofollow">Surratt Relevee Lash Curler, £28</a>, for stress-free curling thanks to the double-wired ergonomic design. </p>
