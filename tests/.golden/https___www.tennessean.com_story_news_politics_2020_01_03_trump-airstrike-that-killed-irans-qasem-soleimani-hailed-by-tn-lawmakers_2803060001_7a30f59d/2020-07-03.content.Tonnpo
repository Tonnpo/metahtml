<h1 class="rm-manual">Qasem Soleimani's 'death makes our world safer': Sen. Blackburn and other Tennessee lawmakers react to airstrike</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="file:///staff/2646756001/natalie-neysa-alund/">Natalie Neysa Alund</a></p>
<p class="rm-manual">Nashville Tennessean</p>
<p>Tennessee's congressional delegation is reacting after the Pentagon 
launched an airstrike Thursday night killing a powerful Iranian military
 leader at Baghdad’s international airport.</p>
<p>"The United States of America has proven we will not back down to 
rogue states like Iran," Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn tweeted. "The 
Quds Force is a terrorist organization and General Qasem Soleimani a 
terrorist. His death makes our world safer."</p>
<p>The airstrike<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/03/trump-airstrikes-kill-soleimani-trigger-global-alarm/2803209001/" rel="noopener"> drew concern</a> from world leaders, who warned that the world had become a dangerous place and urged restraint. </p>
<p>Rep. Tim Burchett, a Knoxville area Republican, tweeted: "The U.S. 
has the right to defend itself from any threat. Iran and its puppets put
 American lives at risk when our embassy was attacked in Iraq. Today, 
(Trump) and our military took appropriate action against Iran and its 
terrorist general, Qassem Soleimani The message is clear: any hostility 
toward Americans will not be tolerated."</p>
<p>The Defense Department <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/01/02/iranian-military-leader-qassim-soleimani-killed-airstrike-iraq/2800808001/" rel="noopener">said it conducted the attack at President Donald Trump's direction as a "defensive action" against Soleimani, </a>who it said was planning further attacks on American diplomats and service members. </p>
<p>Soleimani is an influential figure inside Iran, heading Iran's elite 
Quds Force, part of the country's hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary 
Guard Corps.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, the Defense Department released a statement that 
said Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American 
diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.</p>
<p>"General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths
 of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding 
of thousands more," the statement continued. </p>
<p>"This is a huge victory for America. This is a huge victory for 
freedom. Justice has been served," Republican Rep. Mark Green, who 
represents parts of Middle and West Tennessee said in tweet. </p>
<p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran would observe three days of national mourning while <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/world/2020/01/03/gen-qasem-soleimani-killing-iran-trump-tensions/2802802001/" rel="noopener">also warning</a> that "severe revenge awaits the criminals."</p>
<p>Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, a Republican who represents Chattanooga and 
part of East Tennessee, tweeted, "Soleimani was a terrorist who was 
responsible for the deaths of countless Americans and innocent 
civilians. The leadership from (Trump) and swift action from our brave 
armed forces have rid the world of this evil force. God bless our men 
and women in uniform."</p>
<p>"Under President Trump the U.S. is no longer leading from behind," 
said West Tennessee Republican Rep. David Kustoff in a tweet thanking 
Trump and service members for carrying out the strike. </p>
<h2>Global powers raise alarm in reaction to airstrike</h2>
<p>China, Russia and France, all permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, took a dim view of the U.S. airstrike.</p>
<p>“We are waking up in a more dangerous world. Military escalation is 
always dangerous,” France's deputy minister for foreign affairs, Amelie 
de Montchalin, told RTL radio. "When such actions, such operations, take
 place, we see that escalation is underway.”</p>
<p>Russia likewise characterized the deadly U.S. strike as “fraught with
 serious consequences.” A Foreign Ministry statement warned that “such 
actions don’t help resolve complicated problems in the Middle East, but 
instead lead to a new round of escalating tensions.”</p>
<p>China described itself as “highly concerned.”</p>
<p>“Peace in the Middle East and the Gulf region should be preserved,” 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. "We urge all 
parties concerned, especially the United States, to maintain calm and 
restraint and avoid further escalation of tensions.”</p>
<p>But while echoing the concerns of other Security Council members 
about spiraling tensions, Britain and Germany broke ranks, voicing 
qualified understanding for the U.S. position.</p>
