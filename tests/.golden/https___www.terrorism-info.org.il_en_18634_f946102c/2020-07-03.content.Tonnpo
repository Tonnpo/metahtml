<table> <tbody><tr> <td> Revolutionary Guards emblem </td> <td> Hezbollah emblem </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Left:
 The emblem of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Right, the emblem of 
Hezbollah, an organization set up by the Revolutionary Guards and 
operated by the Quds Force. The similarities between the two are 
obvious: both have upraised arms holding assault rifles, symbols of the 
revolution; above the rifles appear militant Qur�an verses in 
identification with radical Islam; in the background both have globes of
 the earth, giving Islamic militancy a universal dimension; both have 
books(?)’ in all probability meant to be understood as the Qur�an; under
 the rifles are sprigs with leaves, either symbols of growth or peace, 
intended to soften the message sent by the more militaristic symbols. 
Similar motifs also appear in emblems of some of the Palestinian 
terrorist organizations. </p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table>
<p>The Islamic Republic of Iran ‘s concept of exporting the revolution </p>
<p>1. The aspiration to export the Islamic revolution to all Muslim 
societies (and to all human society as well) was an integral part of the
 philosophy of the Ayatollah Khomeini, who led the revolution and 
founded the Islamic republic in 1979. Khomeini and his supporters sought
 to ignore the religious and national differences between Shi’ites and 
Sunnis, and to create a revolutionary Islamic force. Such a force would,
 under Iranian leadership, destroy the �root of evil,� the superpowers 
which were corrupting the world, led by the United States (�the great 
evil�) and its ally, Israel (�the little evil�). That would be done 
while efforts continued to establish Shi’a as the dominant Islamic sect.</p>
<p>2. The concept of exporting the revolution was, for Khomeini and his 
heir the Iranian �leader� Ali Khamenei, a tool for advancing Iran’s 
strategic interests, at the center of which was Iran’s desire to achieve
 regional hegemony and further the campaign against Israel and the West,
 while meddling in the internal affair of other countries (including 
neighboring Arab-Muslim countries in the Middle East and beyond). </p>
<p>The Quds Force as the main tool for exporting the revolution </p>
<p> 3. The Quds 1 ( Jerusalem ) Force is one of five branches of the 
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps , which is the strongest 
military-security body in the country and the regime’s main support. The
 Quds Force is an elite unit numbering, as far as is known, several 
thousand. It was established at the beginning of the 1990s to help 
export the revolution beyond the borders of Iran , and became the main 
Iranian apparatus working secretly beyond its borders . </p>
<table> <tbody><tr> <td> <p>Above the upraised hand holding the assault 
rifle is a militant verse from the Qur�an reading, �Against them make 
ready your strength to the utmost of your power,� [from the 60th verse 
of the eighth Surah, Al-Anfal (�The Spoils of War�)]. The verse is a 
call to prepare for a war with the enemy.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table>
<p>4. The Quds Force is widely active beyond Iran ‘s borders. Its 
activities range from establishing educational systems for 
indoctrination and civilian infrastructures supporting Iran and its 
radical ideology, through dealing with opponents of the regime, to 
setting up and operating armed terrorist and guerilla cells 2 and acting
 to subvert secular, pro-Western Arab-Muslim regimes.</p>
<p>5. Since March 1998 the Quds Force has been headed by Brigadier 
General Qassem Suleimani. 3 The force’s structure includes a general 
headquarters and its departments, designated commands dealing with 
various secret areas of specialization, and regional administrations 
responsible for defined geographical areas. Quds Force operatives are 
conspicuous for their militancy and adherence to ideology. The force, 
has much prestige with Iran ‘s upper echelons, enjoys the use of many 
resources and influence strategic-defense decision-making in Tehran , 
especially concerning sensitive external issues related to Iran ‘s 
activity in countries such as Iraq , Lebanon and Afghanistan . </p>
<table> <tbody><tr> <td> <p>Left: Brigadier General Qassem Suleimani, 
commander of the Quds Force since 1998. Right: in a rare television 
interview, talking about one of his comrades killed during the Iran-Iraq
 war (Iranian TV Channel 1, March 18, 2007).</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table>
<p>6. In line with Iran ‘s policy of exporting the revolution, the official missions of the Quds Force are the following : </p>
<p>A. Carrying out special activities along and beyond Iran ‘s borders. </p>
<p>B. Supporting terrorist organizations , the most prominent of which 
is Hezbollah in Lebanon (which also symbolizes the success of exporting 
the revolution). </p>
<p>C. Operating sleeper networks of terrorists and supporters in the Middle East and in countries throughout the world. </p>
<p>D. Providing military and financial support for Islamic opposition parties in the Arab-Muslim world. </p>
<p>E. Collecting intelligence. </p>
<p>F. Operating against Iranian opposition to the regime beyond Iran ‘s borders.</p>
<p>7. The Quds Force’s missions have as their objective the advancing of
 the Iranian Islamic regime’s strategic goals in two main categories: </p>
<p>A. Implementing Iran ‘s ideological-political doctrines , the most 
important of which are installing Iranian hegemony throughout the 
Arab-Muslim world, extending Shi’a over all Islam and continuing the 
campaign to destroy the State of Israel. </p>
<p>B. Destroying American supremacy and harming American interests in 
the Arab-Muslim world in general and the Middle East in particular, 
through subversion and terrorist attacks against the West and its 
allies, without, insofar as is possible, leaving Iranian footprints.</p>
<p>8. The Quds Force is aggressive in advancing its missions, 
particularly through the traditional use of secret military operations. 
In recent years the Quds Force exploited the democratic process the 
United States has tried to instill in the Middle East, using it to 
improve the status of the terrorist organizations (the �resistance�), 
the militias and radical Islamic groups supported by Iran . That is done
 by creating political tools which can be used to establish Iranian 
influence, and includes paying off supporters in the various Arab 
states. While doing so the Quds Force has been careful to hide the fact 
that its agenda is to further solely Shi’ite Islam, and it has attempted
 to get a foothold in Sunni populations as well. </p>
<p>Focal points of Quds Force activity </p>
<p>The activity of the Quds Force is focused in three main arenas in the
 Middle East: Lebanon , among Palestinians, and Iraq . At the same time,
 Iran continues setting up sleeper cells throughout the world which will
 be activated when Iran feels the time has come, independently and in 
collaboration with Hezbollah: </p>
<p>Lebanon </p>
<p>10. Lebanon , located within the heart of the Arab world, is the 
greatest �achievement� of the plan to export the Iranian revolution. 
Lebanon is considered the finest example of Quds Force �success� and is 
used as the front line in the campaign against Israel . The Force 
operates in Lebanon through local headquarters nicknamed �the Lebanese 
corps.� Every activity undertaken by the Quds Force in Lebanon is 
coordinated with the Syrian regime , and Syria serves as the conduit 
through which weapons are shipped from Iran to Lebanon . </p>

<p>11. The Revolutionary Guards were behind the establishment of 
Hezbollah, originally set up to compete with and eventually replace the 
Amal Shi’ite movement, which is nationalist-secular, and which refused 
to subordinate itself to the revolutionary Islamic regime in Tehran . 4 
Since the beginning of the 1990s the Quds Force has fostered and 
supported Hezbollah. During that time it has managed to strengthen and 
install Hezbollah among the Shi’ites in Lebanon and to help the 
organization construct a vast military infrastructure with capabilities 
of a state and not of a terrorist organization. It has done that through
 generous funding (hundreds of millions of dollars a year), formulating 
operative plans, supplying with various types of weapons (including 
medium- and long-range rockets which can penetrate into the heart of 
Israel ) and by providing Hezbollah operatives with military training. </p>
<p> The Hezbollah emblem, inspired by that of the Revolutionary Guards. The globe, above which </p>
<p> there is a Qur’an verse, symbolizes the universal aspect of Hezbollah and radical Islam. </p>
<p>12. The Quds Force gave Hezbollah massive active support during the 
second Lebanon war (July-August 2006) and was integrated into the 
organization’s command structure. After the war it performed a 
significant role in rehabilitating Hezbollah’s military might, one of 
whose manifestations was the smuggling of weapons from Iran to Lebanon .
 Qassem Suleimani, the Quds Force commander, speaking on the occasion of
 Jerusalem Day (which fell on October 20, 2006 ), said the following of 
the results of the second Lebanon war and its influence on the 
Palestinian arena: </p>
<p>�Following Hezbollah’s victory in Lebanon a new Middle East was 
created, not American but Islamic �While the jihad groups were forming 
in Palestine, a Shi’ite organization called Hezbollah in Lebanon 
succeeded in exporting to Palestine a model of the way of life of faith.
 Hezbollah performed a central function in turning the stones of 
Palestine into rockets �Hamas’s steadfastness strengthened the security 
of the Arab states, but unfortunately, the Arab leaders betrayed�� 5</p>
<p>13. The sections which follow describe some of the areas in which 
Iran has provided support for Hezbollah through the Quds Force: </p>
<p>Smuggling weapons into Lebanon </p>
<p>14. Most of the weapons originating in Iran reach Hezbollah in 
Lebanon in air shipments directed by the Quds Force. They are loaded 
onto Iranian planes and land in Damascus ‘ international airport, 
coordinated with Syria and with Syrian collaboration. From there they 
are smuggled overland to Hezbollah in Lebanon . </p>
<p>15. During the years before the second Lebanon war the Iranians 
transferred weapons to Hezbollah in an almost unbroken stream by taking 
advantage of various opportune situations. For example, at least nine 
times the Quds Force used Iranian and Syrian cargo planes flying 
humanitarian aid in to the earthquake victims at Bam (in southeastern 
Iran) to take large quantities of weapons for Hezbollah on their return 
flights (December 2003 � January 2004). </p>
<p>Training Hezbollah operatives in Iran and Lebanon </p>
<p> 16. The Quds Force plays a central role in the training received by 
Hezbollah operatives in camps in Iran , using bases and facilities 
belonging to the Revolutionary Guards. The training is intended to raise
 the Hezbollah operatives’ military level and to teach them to use the 
modern weapons Iran provides them with. Revolutionary Guards also train 
Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon , especially at bases and facilities in 
the Beqa’a Valley.</p>
<p>17. Hezbollah operatives undergo various types of training in Iran , 
from integrated maneuvers to launching anti-tank and anti-aircraft 
weapons, including Sagger and TOW missiles. Special attention is given 
to training Hezbollah operatives in the use of strategic and advanced 
weapons, such as ground-to-ground rockets with a range of more than 75 
km (46.4 miles) and unmanned planes. Revolutionary Guards officers 
helped Hezbollah launch an Iranian-made unmanned plane into Israel in 
November 2004.</p>
<p>18. The two main camps used most often by the Quds Force for the 
training of foreign terrorist-operatives are the Imam Ali camp in Tehran
 and the camp at Bahonar near Karaj , north of Tehran . Two Hezbollah 
terrorists who were captured by the IDF during the second Lebanon war 
stated during interrogation that they had been trained by Revolutionary 
Guards operatives at the camp near Karaj . One of the terrorists was 
Hussein Ali Suleiman , a Hezbollah terrorist who was involved in the 
abducting of the two IDF soldiers, Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, the 
act which led to the outbreak of the war. He stated that he had been 
trained in Iran by the Revolutionary Guards as part of a group of 40-50 
Hezbollah operatives from Lebanon . Their passports were not stamped in 
either Syria or Iran to hide the fact that they had undergone training 
in Iran . </p>
<p> Hussein Ali Suleiman, who took part in the abduction of the two Israeli soldiers </p>
<p> (Photo courtesy of the IDF spokesperson) . He was trained in Iran by the Revolutionary Guards . </p>
<p>Supervising the construction of Hezbollah’s military force and preparing if for a possible confrontation with Israel </p>
<p>19. During the six years after the IDF withdrawal from Lebanon (May 
24, 2000) the Quds Force in Lebanon occupied itself with establishing 
and improving Hezbollah’s offensive and defensive capabilities in 
preparation for a possible confrontation with Israel. The Quds Force set
 up a defensive deployment in south Lebanon and turned Hezbollah into an
 organization with the military capabilities of a state, arming it more 
like an Iranian division than a terrorist organization. Hezbollah’s 
infrastructure was constructed, supervised and advised by operatives of 
the Revolutionary Guards, who frequently visited south Lebanon and in 
several instances even approached the fence separating Lebanon from 
Israel .</p>
<p>20. Proof of the above was provided by one of the Hezbollah 
terrorists captured during the second Lebanon war, who stated that a 
year and a half previously, while he was standing guard in south 
Lebanon, two Iranians accompanied by two Hezbollah officers visited his 
post. He identified one of the two Iranians as a member of the 
Revolutionary Guards who in the past had trained him in anti-aircraft 
warfare in Iran . </p>
<p>Funding Hezbollah’s activity </p>
<p>21. Iran provides Hezbollah with several hundreds of millions of 
dollars a year. The money serves to finance the organization’s terrorist
 activity, purchase weapons, pay operatives’ salaries, train operatives 
and transfer funds to terrorist infrastructures in the Palestinian 
Authority-administered territories. In addition, the Iranian money is 
used to pay the organizations’ expenses and support its wide range of 
social activities (which include operating schools, hospitals, clinics, 
welfare institutions, etc.), and for propaganda and indoctrination 
activities , through which Hezbollah spreads Iranian Islamic revolution 
ideology throughout Lebanon and fosters the personality cult of the 
�leader,� Ali Khamenei. </p>
<p>22. To transfer funds to Hezbollah the Iranians use the Quds Force 
and the foreign ministry through the embassies in Damascus and Beirut . 
Iranian semi-governmental institutions also transfer funds, among them 
charitable societies controlled by Khamenei which have branches in 
Lebanon .</p>
<p>23. After the IDF left the security zone in south Lebanon , Iran ‘s 
financial support of Hezbollah increased, both to improve its military 
capabilities and to provide more money for Palestinian terrorist 
activities in the Palestinian Authority-administered territories. After 
the second Lebanon war the Iranians provided Hezbollah with considerable
 resources, in our assessment several hundred million dollars, 6 to 
repair the severe damage done to Shi’ite population centers in Beirut 
and south Lebanon . </p>
<p>The Palestinian arena </p>
<p> 24. The Quds Force encourages and finances terrorist attacks, and 
smuggles weapons into the PA-administered territories. In addition, it 
supports and aids most of the prominent Palestinian terrorist 
organizations (the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Jibril’s 
PFLP-GC) whose headquarters are in Damascus . It supports them with 
money and training and provides them with technological-operational aid,
 including the know-how to improve weapons such as powerful side 
charges. The Force works in collaboration with the Iranian Ministry of 
Intelligence and Security.</p>
<table> <tbody><tr> <td> <p>Hamas�s homemade explosively formed 
projectiles (EFPs) called shawaz (flame). They were discovered by the 
IDF on September 12, 2006, near the main road in the Gaza Strip. They 
have higher penetration capabilities than the charges usually used by 
the Palestinian terrorist organizations, and are able to pierce more 
than 200 mm (8�) of steel. Their higher capabilities are the result of 
improvements and the use of more powerful explosives, both based on 
technical know-how supplied by Iran and/or Hezbollah.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table>
<p>25. Members of the Quds Force were involved in the first stages of 
the Palestinian terrorist campaign (intifada) through enlisting 
Palestinians who were wounded in terrorist attacks and went to Iran for 
medical treatment. During their stay in the country some of them were 
recruited by Quds Force activists and underwent training intended to 
prepare them to attack Israeli targets. The Israeli security forces 
detained wounded terrorists from the Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria who 
were recruited by the Iranians and sent to the PA-administered 
territories.</p>
<p>26. The following diagram shows the process of the Quds Force recruitment of wounded Palestinians: 7</p>
<p>27. Apparently after the second Lebanon war Iran increased its 
support of the Palestinian terrorist organizations as part of an attempt
 to strengthen its influence with the Hamas government. The Quds Force 
is also involved in Hezbollah activities which support and direct 
terrorist attacks against Israel carried out by the Palestinian 
terrorist organizations. 8</p>
<p>The inspiration of Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah symbols on Palestinian terrorist organization iconography </p>
<p>28. The motif of the upraised arm holding an assault rifle and the 
use of militant verses from the Qur’an appear on Palestinian terrorist 
organization propaganda material, inspired, in our assessment, by the 
Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah. The main difference is in their 
universal aspect (the globe of the earth in the background), as opposed 
to the local-Palestinian nature of the Palestinian terrorist 
organizations (the map of � Palestine ,� the Palestinian flag). </p>

<p>29. The Quds Force leads the Iranian collaboration with the various 
organizations in Iraq to strengthen Iran ‘s influence there and to 
support them in their campaign against the United States and the 
coalition forces. It provides some of the organizations (for example, 
the Badr Brigade and the Mahdi Army) with money, equipment and weapons. 
The weapons, particularly powerful IEDs, have led to the deaths of 
scores of coalition force troops serving in Iraq .</p>
<p>30. In the past few months the Western media have made much evidence 
public (based mainly on American or British sources) regarding the 
support the Quds Force gives the various organizations in Iraq , 
especially the Shi’ite organizations. For example: </p>
<p>A. On December 22, 2006 , and at the beginning of January 2007 
American forces in Iraq detained Iranian activists, among them some 
belonging to the Quds Force, on suspicion of involvement in subversive 
activities and terrorism. Among those detained (and later released) were
 Brigadier General Mohsen Shizari and Colonel Abu Ahmad Davari , both 
highly placed in the Quds Force. Several Quds Force activists were 
detained in an American raid on the Iranian liaison office in Erbil in 
northern Iraq . It has been suggested that the abduction of the 15 
British sailors was planned in advance to supply hostages to trade for 
the Revolutionary Guards and intelligence officers captured by the 
Americans in Iraq . 9</p>
<p>B. At the end of February 2007 a British newspaper revealed that 100 
sniper rifles sent to Iran by the Austrian firm of Steyr-Mannlicher 
between 2004 and 2005 for use against drug smugglers operating along the
 Afghanistan border found their way into the hands of the Shi’ite 
opposition and were actually used to carry out attacks against the 
coalition forces in Iraq. The rifles are extremely accurate and their 
ammunition (some of which is manufactured in Iran ) can pierce armor at a
 distance of 1.5 km (.93 miles). 10</p>
<p>C. Two high-ranking commanders of the Mahdi Army, the Shi’ite militia
 led by Moqtada Sadr, told an AP reporter that hundreds of Shi’ite 
militiamen had gone to Iraq to be trained by the Quds Force. They stated
 that Iran was funding Mahdi Army deserters (AP, March 22, 2007 ). </p>
<p>D. At a February 11 , 2007 press briefing, senior American military 
personnel in Baghdad showed examples of explosives bearing serial 
numbers and Iranian script. One of the Americans said that the 
Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force had supplied the explosives and that 
instructions for their use had come from highly-placed sources in the 
Iranian government. 11</p>
<p>E. In a raid on a Shi’ite arms storehouse in the city of Hillah in 
southern Iraq , Iranian-manufactured armor-penetrating side charges had 
been found. Some of them were plate charges which had been camouflaged 
in plastic made to look like rocks, reminiscent of the charges used by 
Hezbollah in south Lebanon against the IDF. Infrared sensors were also 
found, as were electronic detonators and information about explosives 
exclusive to Iran . Ten Strella anti-aircraft missiles were also found 
in the raid, which had been manufactured in China and repainted by Iran .
 12</p>
<p> A side charge, apparently of Iranian manufacture, found in south Lebanon . </p>
<p> Similar charges were found in Iraq . </p>
<p>F. At the hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee Annual 
Threat Assessment on February 27, 2007 , Mike McConnell, Director of 
National Intelligence, said the following in answer to a question about 
the depth Quds Force involvement in Iraq : �We know there are Iranian 
weapons manufactured in Iran . We know that Qods Forces are bringing 
them into [ Iraq ].� McConnell added that he was of the opinion that a 
large quantity of the weapons arriving in Iraq came through Syria and 
noted that there was Iranian-Syrian collaboration in everything 
concerning support of Hezbollah. He also stated that 170 American 
soldiers had been killed as a result of Iranian weapons supplied by the 
Quds Force . 13</p>
<p>31. The Quds Force is currently active in improving the operational 
capabilities of the anti-American elements working in Iraq , and is also
 establishing an infrastructure in Iraq which will be able to carry out 
attacks encouraged and directed by Iran . At the same time, it is 
setting up communications channels with power centers in the political 
arena for Iran to be able to strengthen its influence over Iraq and to 
weaken the influence of the United States there. </p>
<p>The involvement of the Quds Force in global terrorism </p>
<p>32. On the morning of July 18, 1994 , there was an explosion at the 
Jewish Community Center building (AMIA) in Buenos Aires . The blast 
killed 85 individuals who were in the building or close by, and wounded 
hundreds. A large part of the building collapsed and severe damage was 
done to neighboring structures. The explosion was caused by a car bomb 
detonated by a Hezbollah suicide bomber, who used hundreds of kilograms 
of explosives. The bombing was similar to that at the Israeli embassy in
 Buenos Aires on March 17, 1992 , which killed 30 and wounded more than 
220. </p>
<p> The ruins of the AMIA building </p>
<p>33. On October 25, 2006 , the Dr. Alberto Nisman, the Argentinean 
attorney general, and attorney Marcelo Mart�nez Burgos presented the 
findings of the special team which investigated the terrorist attack 
which destroyed the Jewish Community Center building (AMIA) in Buenos 
Aires. The detailed report unequivocally showed that the decision to 
blow up the building was taken by the highest echelons of the Iranian 
government and that the commander of the Quds Force at that time, Ahmad 
Vahidi, had been involved. The Iranians had asked Hezbollah , which also
 serves as a tool for its strategies beyond the Lebanese arena, to carry
 out the attack. </p>
<p>34. The Argentinean attorney general asked for international arrest 
warrants to be issued for seven senior Iranian figures who had been 
involved in the attack, among them Ahmad Vahidi, at the time of the 
bombing commander of the Quds Force . On November 9, 2006 , Argentinean 
judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral complied with the request and issued the 
warrants. Argentina also appealed to Interpol. In March 2007 Interpol’s 
Executive Committee issued international extradition warrants (�Red 
Notices�) for a senior Hezbollah operative ( Imad Moughnieh ) and five 
high-ranking Iranian official who were on the list presented by the 
Argentineans, among them Ahmad Vahidi . 14Iran is expected to appeal the
 warrants, which will put off Interpole’s decision to November 2007. </p>
<p> Argentina ‘s wanted list. Bottom right: Ahmad Vahidi </p>
<p class="">35. In recent years Iran has avoided direct involvement in 
terrorist attacks carried out abroad for fear of affecting its image. 
However, the Quds Force and the Iranian intelligence services continue 
to build sleeper cells throughout the world, directly or through 
Hezbollah. That is done to establish operational capabilities which will
 enable Iran to carry out terrorist attacks when it feels the time has 
come, against Western and Jewish and/or Israeli targets, both directly 
and independently and by using Hezbollah as a contractor. </p>
