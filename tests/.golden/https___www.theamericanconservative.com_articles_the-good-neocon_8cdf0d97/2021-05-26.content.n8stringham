<p><span>In writing a book on the new era America is entering after the 
Iraqi debacle, I revisited the various contributions to a post-Cold War 
symposium organized by </span><span>Owen Harries of The National Interest.</span></p>
<p><span> Then, before the crack-up of conservatism, the most respected 
foreign-policy voice of neoconservatism was that of Jeane Kirkpatrick. A
 Humphrey Democrat who had moved rightward since school days at Stephens
 and Barnard, Kirkpatrick had been Reagan’s ambassador to the UN. The 
Gipper was deeply fond of her. At the Republican Convention of 1984, 
Jeane had coined two phrases that have lived on: “San Francisco 
Democrats” and “They always blame America first!” </span></p>
<p><span>Her essay, “A Normal Country in a Normal Time,” was published 
in the fall 1990 issue of TNI. Jeane likely finished it after the Berlin
 Wall fell but before Saddam’s August invasion of Kuwait.</span></p>
<p><span> Though her specialty was foreign policy, she began by declaring, “America’s purposes are mainly domestic.”</span></p>
<p><span> “A good society is defined not by its foreign policy but by 
its internal qualities. … Foreign policy becomes a major aspect of a 
society only if its government is expansionist, imperial, aggressive, or
 when it is threatened by aggression. One of the most important 
consequences of the half century of war and Cold War has been to give 
foreign affairs an unnatural importance.”</span></p>
<p><span> Kirkpatrick believed that foreign policy must now take a 
backseat: “The end of the Cold War frees time, attention and resources 
to American ends.”</span></p>
<p><span> In a frontal assault on today’s neoconservative dogmas about 
America having an historic mission to democratize mankind, Jeane noted 
that the only mention of foreign policy in the preamble to the 
Constitution is “provide for the common defense.” </span></p>
<p><span> “There is no mystical American ‘mission,’ or purpose to be 
‘found’ independently of the U.S. Constitution. … There is no inherent 
or historical ‘imperative’ for the U.S. government to seek to achieve 
any other goal—however great—except as it is mandated by the 
Constitution or adopted by the people through elected officials.”</span></p>
<p><span> Bush’s doctrine of “world democratic revolution” and “ending 
tyranny on earth,” as it has not been ratified by an elected Congress, 
is without constitutional sanction. When Bush goes, it goes.</span></p>
<p><span> In those days, Charles Krauthammer was already burbling on 
about surrendering U.S. sovereignty to merge with Europe and Japan in a 
“super-sovereign” entity that would be “hegemonic in the world.” Jeane 
brought him up short: “[I]t is not America’s purpose to establish 
‘universal dominance’… not even the universal dominance of democracy. … 
It is not within the United States’ power to democratize the world.” </span></p>
<p><span> Beware of elites who behave like some priestly class that 
alone has the knowledge, experience, and wisdom to guide foreign policy,
 she warned. “It has become more important than ever that the experts 
who conduct foreign policy on our behalf be subject to the direction and
 control of the people.”</span></p>
<p><span> Beware, too, of an “internationalism” that “looks at the world
 and asks what needs to be done—with little explicit concern for the 
national interest.”</span></p>
<p><span> America “should assume no new obligations in remote places,” 
she admonished. The United States “should negotiate rules which give 
U.S. products fair access to foreign markets and give foreign businesses
 no better than fair access to U.S. markets … to ensure that the 
patterns of trade competition do not undermine the United States’ 
technological and industrial base.”</span></p>
<p><span> “This is a government responsibility which cannot be ignored because of anxieties about an ‘industrial’ policy.” </span></p>
<p><span>Kirkpatrick was no Wall Street Journal free-trade fundamentalist. She was an economic nationalist.</span></p>
<p><span> As for the U.S. role in NATO, she wrote, “Neither can the U.S.
 be expected to sustain an expensive role in an alliance whose chief 
role is to diminish European fear of a resurgent Germany.”</span></p>
<p><span> “We should not spend American money protecting an affluent Japan …”</span></p>
<p><span> “Most of the international military obligations that we 
assumed were once important are now outdated. … It is time to give up 
the dubious benefits of superpower status and become again an usually 
successful, open American republic.” A republic, not an empire, the lady
 said.</span></p>
<p><span> In closing, she wrote, “The United States preformed heroically
 in a time when heroism was required; altruistically during the long 
years when freedom was endangered.</span></p>
<p><span> “The time when America should bear such unusual burdens is 
past. With the return of ‘normal’ times we can again become a normal 
nation.”</span></p>
<p><span>Had Bush II heeded her wise counsel, America would not be in 
the hellish mess it is in today. Jeane Kirkpatrick died in December at 
80 years of age. Requiescat in pace. </span></p>
