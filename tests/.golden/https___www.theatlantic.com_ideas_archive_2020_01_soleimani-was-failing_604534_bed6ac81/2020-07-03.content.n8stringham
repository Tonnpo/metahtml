<h1 class="rm-manual">Soleimani Was Failing</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">Trump should have left Soleimani alive and in place, but made him operationally ineffective by killing his deputies.</p>

<figcaption class="rm-manual"><span>Wana News Agency / Reuters</span></figcaption><p>Hard
 to say he didn’t deserve it. Qassem Soleimani was responsible for 11 
recent attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq even before the one that 
killed a U.S. contractor; Iranian attacks on neutral, civilian shipping 
in the Gulf; the attack on Aramco facilities in Saudi Arabia; IEDs that 
killed hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq. He was the architect of 
Iran’s strategy of mobilizing militias to destabilize neighboring states
 and the brutal strategy of bleeding Syria dry. </p>
<p>While we may not be at war with Iran, Soleimani has been at war with 
the United States for 15 years. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is 
incorrect that “this war started when the JCPOA was entered into,” but 
Iran’s proxy attacks did increase after the nuclear agreement came into 
force, and they have increased significantly since the U.S. withdrew 
from the agreement. </p>
<p>The previous two American presidents both considered killing 
Soleimani as part of the Iraq War effort. And President Donald Trump had
 been incredibly—even perhaps damagingly—restrained in not overtly 
retaliating for attacks on shipping, Aramco, U.S. bases, and the embassy
 in Iraq. American allies in the Middle East and beyond were worried 
about the U.S. reestablishing deterrence, by which they mean retaliating
 to show the Iranians and other potential predators that it wouldn’t let
 them get away with these acts of war.</p>
<p>So the administration was justified in killing Soleimani—but that doesn’t mean it was a good idea.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/soleimanis-ultimate-revenge/604471/">William J. Burns and Jake Sullivan: Soleimani’s ultimate revenge</a></p>
<p>The fact is that much of Soleimani’s strategy had begun to falter, 
and in ways advantageous to U.S. interests. While Soleimani fought the 
ground war in Syria on Bashar al-Assad’s behalf, only Russian 
intervention prevented Assad’s fall. Russia will dictate the terms of 
Syria’s future, not Iran. Iraq’s Kurdish president had succeeded in 
preventing a pro-Iranian successor to pro-Iranian Prime Minister Haider 
al-Abadi. The protests in Iraq and Lebanon were about corruption and 
unrepresentative governance, which Iran was associated with because of 
its influence in those countries even before Iranian-affiliated militias
 responded violently. In the case of Iraq, they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/21/world/middleeast/Iraq-protests-Iran.html">killed more than</a> 500 protesters and wounded a staggering 19,000.</p>
<p>Iran’s strategy of gaining depth beyond its borders succeeded because
 it was opaque. Soleimani’s desire for credit—pictures from regional 
battlefields, chairing the Iraqi-government meeting that decided whether
 Abadi would remain in power—removed the plausible deniability of 
Iranian orchestration, activating nationalistic antibodies in Iraq and 
Lebanon. </p>
<p>It’s possible, even likely, that recent attacks by Iran on U.S. bases in Iraq were an overt attempt to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/05/soleimani-death-huge-blow-to-iran-plans-for-regional-domination">distract</a>
 from the validity of protests in Iraq. In that, Soleimani may have 
succeeded in death at what he was failing to achieve in life. Judging by
 the crowds at Soleimani’s funerals in Iran, his killing erased fissures
 between Iranians and their government, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>Iraq, meanwhile, may well determine that it’s more secure without 
U.S. forces. Trump’s threat not to leave Iraq unless remunerated for the
 cost of bases built in that country are damaging to the relationship. 
Who wants that kind of friend?</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/trump-has-produced-extraordinarily-dangerous-moment/604456/">Ben Rhodes: An extraordinarily dangerous moment</a></p>
<p>Losing the strategist of Iranian proxy warfare would be a cheap price
 to pay for Iran to achieve a rapprochement between the government and 
its people, and a U.S. exit from Iraq. That’s especially the case since 
the proxy strategy may have been reaching its limits under Soleimani, 
and he’d created a capable cadre of deputies.</p>
<p>The better strategy would have been to leave Soleimani alive and in 
place, but to make him operationally ineffective by killing his 
deputies, as the U.S. has done with al-Qaeda deputies. Taking out a 
deputy draws less press, but sends a powerful message; the strategy 
places the onus of escalation on Iran and gives the U.S. the benefit of a
 public posture of restraint. It’s what the Eisenhower administration 
called “quiet military measures” during the 1958 Berlin crisis.</p>
<p>But since Trump decided to go after the Quds Force commander, he 
should at least have coordinated with countries that host U.S. bases or 
that have deployed forces in furtherance of U.S. interests in the Middle
 East. He did not. When the U.S. leaves allies out of the loop, those 
allies become less likely to contribute to future coalitions, leading to
 more strain on U.S. forces. Trump also made it abundantly clear that he
 thinks only of America, first and last, when he tweeted that the U.S. 
would respond to any attacks on U.S. service personnel specifically. 
That is a poor way to <a href="https://www.defense.gov/explore/story/Article/1718356/5-things-to-know-about-the-fight-against-isis-in-syria/">repay</a>
 the 78 other countries and four international organizations 
participating in the fight against the Islamic State for their 
dedication.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most generous take on the Soleimani killing is that it 
merely hastened negative outcomes that would have happened anyway. Iran 
would likely have restarted enrichment at its nuclear plants, and 
continued attacks on U.S. interests and commerce passing through the 
Gulf. U.S. troops may have left Iraq, given Trump’s well-publicized 
efforts to abandon operations there.</p>
<p>As so often with the Trump administration, the problem is less the 
policy position than the execution. The administration has a way of 
maximizing the costs and minimizing the benefits of its actions.</p>
