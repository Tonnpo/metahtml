<h1 class="rm-manual">It Wasn’t the Law That Stopped Other Presidents From Killing Soleimani</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">The Iranian general helped get hundreds of Americans killed—through two administrations. Both declined to kill him.</p>

 about nobody in Washington wants to defend Qassem Soleimani—even if 
they condemn his killing. He was a terrorist kingpin; he destroyed the 
lives of countless people across an entire region for more than a 
decade; he had Syrian, Iraqi, Yemeni, Lebanese, and American blood on 
his hands. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy slammed what he called an 
assassination as he <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1212913952436445185?s=20">tweeted</a>,
 “Soleimani was an enemy of the United States. That’s not a question.” 
Representative Eliot Engel, the Democratic chair of House Foreign 
Affairs Committee, <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/2020/1/engel-statement-on-killing-of-qasem-soleimani">decried</a>
 the lack of consultation with Congress; he also called Soleimani “the 
mastermind of immense violence, suffering, and instability.” Much of the
 litany of Soleimani’s crimes through two presidential administrations 
prior to Donald Trump’s is well-known.</p>
<p>So why kill him now?</p>
<p>George W. Bush did <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/gt-essay/irans-deadly-puppet-master-qassem-suleimani/">not target him</a>
 during the height of the Iraq War, when Iranian-supplied roadside bombs
 and Iran-backed militias were killing hundreds of American troops. By 
2011, that toll had reached more than 600 and Barack Obama was the 
president; he too declined to hit the general. But at some point Trump, 
who came into office vowing to pull the United States out from Middle 
Eastern wars, decided to cross a line two war-president predecessors 
feared breaching.</p>
<p>This fear wasn’t because of America’s long-standing <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12333.html">prohibition</a>
 of “assassination,” forged during the Cold War to check the excesses of
 the CIA. Successive administrations since September 11 have interpreted
 this ban narrowly, arguing that singling out an individual for death on
 the battlefield doesn’t really count. The ban arose in response to 
covert CIA plots to, for example, kill Fidel Castro with an exploding 
cigar during peacetime—essentially, attempting to kill because of 
political differences, not in wartime self-defense, said Matthew Waxman,
 who directs the National Security Law Program at Columbia University 
and served in the Bush administration. The Obama administration used the
 term targeted killing for strikes on terrorist leaders in overseas 
battlefields—<a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/targeted-killings">arguing</a> that they fell under a right to self-defense in an ongoing war against al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced. “These killings cannot be distinguished 
from unlawful assassination,” Mary Ellen O’Connell, a professor at Notre
 Dame Law School, told me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/iran-loses-qassem-soleimani-its-indispensable-man/604375/">Andrew Exum: Iran loses its indispensable man</a></p>
<p>The Soleimani killing would be no more or less legal in this context 
than that of a nonstate leader just because he worked as a top general, 
in uniform, for a state. If you subscribe to the idea that targeting an 
individual combatant in self-defense isn’t the same as an assassination,
 then Soleimani is fair game—provided you credit Trump’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-killing-qasem-soleimani/">claim</a>
 that Soleimani was plotting “imminent and sinister” attacks against 
Americans. A State Department official on a phone call with reporters 
noted, “Assassinations are not allowed under law.” But the official 
argued that this wasn’t one. “The criteria is: Do you have overwhelming 
evidence that somebody is going to launch a military or terrorist attack
 against you? Check that box. The second one is: Do you have some legal 
means to, like, have this guy arrested by the Belgian authorities or 
something? Check that box, because there’s no way anybody was going to 
stop Qassem Soleimani in the places he was running around—Damascus, 
Beirut. And so you take lethal action against him.”</p>
<p>If you believe targeted killings is a sanitized term for 
assassinations, which have become normalized in the drone-war era but 
are no less illegal, then targeting Soleimani is a war crime, especially
 since there’s no formal state of war between the United States and 
Iran. “Preemptive self-defense is never a legal justification for 
assassination,” O’Connell said. “Nothing is. The relevant law is the 
United Nations Charter, which defines self-defense as a right to respond
 to an actual and significant armed attack.”</p>
<p>Two administrations sidestepped this debate when it came to 
Soleimani, not as much for legal or moral reasons as for strategic ones.
 The two sides of this conflict have opted for other forms of 
confrontation, from proxy fights to sabotage to cyberattacks to 
sanctions, but they didn’t kill each other’s generals. Now that barrier 
has been shattered, leaving the world to await Iran’s next move in a 
game with suddenly higher stakes. From the Iranian perspective, it 
doesn’t much matter whether the U.S. administration considers 
Soleimani’s death an assassination or not. He’s still a dead general.</p>
<p>Elissa Slotkin, a Democratic representative and former CIA analyst 
focused on Shia militias, said in a statement that she’d seen friends 
and colleagues killed or hurt by Iranian weapons under Soleimani’s 
guidance when she served in Iraq. She said she was involved in 
discussions during both the Bush and Obama administrations about how to 
respond to his violence. Neither opted for assassination.</p>
<p>“What always kept both Democratic and Republican presidents from 
targeting Soleimani himself was the simple question: Was the strike 
worth the likely retaliation, and the potential to pull us into 
protracted conflict?” she said. “The two administrations I worked for 
both determined that the ultimate ends didn’t justify the means. The 
Trump Administration has made a different calculation.”</p>

<p>Trump-administration officials have so far declined to specify what exactly prompted that calculation, though Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-killing-qasem-soleimani/">said</a>
 Soleimani was planning to attack American diplomats and military 
personnel. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, <a href="https://twitter.com/DanLamothe/status/1213195227814596625">told</a> some reporters that “the risk of inaction exceeded the risk of action,” according to The Washington Post’s Dan Lamothe.</p>
<p>The risks of action in other cases have restrained the U.S. from 
targeting military leaders—for instance, to hold on to the possibility 
of negotiations, or out of the belief, in Murphy’s words, that “such 
action will get more, not less, Americans killed.” But action is not 
unprecedented. “We have [in the past] gone after very, very senior 
military leaders; usually that would be kind of in the course of an 
ongoing war,” Waxman told me. During the Iraq War, a congressionally 
authorized state-on-state conflict, U.S. troops had a “deck of cards” of
 top most-wanted figures, including senior leaders in Saddam Hussein’s 
armed forces. During World War II, the U.S. killed the Japanese admiral <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/how-the-us-assassinated-the-japanese-admiral-who-planned-20202">who plotted</a> the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>But in both of those cases, the United States was in a formal state 
of armed conflict. More recently, as the U.S. has focused on fighting 
nonstate terrorist organizations, it has also gone after the leadership 
of those groups. Though Iran has since May staged a series of violent 
attacks against U.S. allies and interests in the region—culminating, in 
the past two months, in rocket attacks against U.S. or allied bases in 
Iraq and the death of an American contractor—no formal war has been 
declared. And when Soleimani was killed, he died on the soil of a 
U.S.-allied country, whose government then <a href="https://twitter.com/IraqiGovt/status/1213206084464381956?s=20">condemned</a> the attack.</p>
<p>The State Department official conceded the risks in the background 
call with reporters. “We cannot promise that we have broken the circle 
of violence,” the official said. But without Soleimani, the official 
said, “if we do see an increase in violence, it probably will not be as 
devilishly ingenious.”</p>
