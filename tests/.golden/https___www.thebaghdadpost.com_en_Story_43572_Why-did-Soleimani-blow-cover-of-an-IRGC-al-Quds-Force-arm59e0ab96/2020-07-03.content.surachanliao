<h2 class="rm-manual"> Why did Soleimani blow cover of an IRGC al-Quds Force arm? </h2>
<h3 class="rm-manual"> <a href="file:///en/Author/783/Ali-Alfoneh">Ali Alfoneh</a> </h3>
<p> It is quite common that intelligence agencies and special operations
 forces use front organizations to provide cover for their covert agents
 and actions. Those agencies openly admit their relationship with the 
covers is less common if not unprecedented.</p>
<p> This is exactly what happened July 25. The government-controlled 
Iranian media reported Major-General Qassem Soleimani, chief commander 
of extraterritorial operations al-Quds Force of the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), appointed a new director for the 
Reconstruction Organization of Holy Shrines in Iraq.</p>
<p> The questions are what the exact role of this organization is and 
why Soleimani disclosed the relationship between al-Quds Force and its 
cover.</p>
<p> Its website states that the Reconstruction Organization was 
established as a “non-governmental” and “non-profit” entity in 2003, 
which coincides with the US-led invasion of Iraq. The website discloses 
that, apart from activities in Balad, Karbala, Kazimiyah, Musayib, Najaf
 and Samarra in Iraq, the organization has had engagements in Syria.</p>
<p> Besides reconstructing Shiite shrines, those activities include 
international fundraising for the reconstruction effort and servicing 
Iranian pilgrims. Iraqi officials interviewed by IRNA said the number of
 Iranian pilgrims to Iraq totaled 3.5 million by 2018. That number has 
dramatically declined because of US sanctions against Iran and a 50% 
devaluation of the Iranian rial.</p>
<p> Despite claims of the Reconstruction Organization being a 
non-governmental organization, there are many indications that it is a 
governmental entity. The Reconstruction Organization appears on the 
country’s annual budget and representatives of Iranian Supreme Leader 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei closely monitor its work.</p>
<p> The organization has long been suspected of being a cover for 
al-Quds Force. Hassan Pelarak, the first director of the organization, 
is a native of Kerman and a veteran of the 41st Sarallah Division of the
 IRGC. So is Soleimani, who was commander of the division during the war
 with Iraq.</p>
<p> The Reconstruction Organization would be an obvious cover for 
al-Quds Force, which can use the cover of pilgrim and construction 
materials logistics to transport men and materiel from Iran to Iraq, 
Syria and Lebanon.</p>
<p> Those suspicions were proven right when Soleimani, on July 25, 
appointed Pelarak his “special assistant” and “adviser to the Quds Force
 commander” and replaced him with Mohammad Jalal-Maab, another native of
 Kerman.</p>
<p> Soleimani’s motives for disclosing the relationship between the 
Reconstruction Organization and al-Quds Force are not clear but the 
decree he issued may shed light into them: Al-Quds Force’s commander 
asked Pelarak to join “the economics committee of the [Quds] Force to 
neutralize the sanctions.”</p>
<p> It is not known to what extent al-Quds Force is engaged in bypassing
 the US sanctions to help Iran’s economy and openly declaring such 
intentions hardly enhances such schemes. However, Soleimani may hope the
 declarations alone will further endear him and al-Quds Force to the 
Iranian public.</p>
<p> This approach is not free of risk. Rather than perceiving Soleimani 
and al-Quds Force as saviors, the Iranian public may just as well 
question the wisdom of Iran using scarce resources in Iraq, Syria and 
Lebanon rather than helping needy Iranians.</p>
<p> Worse, the Iranian public may blame the regime in Tehran and al-Quds
 Force for economic hardships, rather than the Trump administration and 
its maximum pressure campaign against Iran. </p>
