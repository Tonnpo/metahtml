<p>For the Nigerian government under President Muhammadu Buhari, no two 
words carry with them today equal measure of excitement and objection as
 the words ‚Äúchange‚Äù and ‚Äúrevolution.‚Äù You can earn an unearned place at 
the top by simply professing to be a ‚Äúchange‚Äù apostle the same way you 
can be conferred with a Mussolini-like jailing with manacles affixed to 
your hands if ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù is what revs you. Same atmospherics of fear 
obtained during the first coming of General Buhari. </p>
<p>For fear of being jailed like Nduka Irabor and Tunde Thompson, 
writers simply embraced Afghanistanism, a practice that gained notoriety
 in the United States in the 1970s where, rather than comment on 
controversial issues at home, academics and writers turned their 
attention to issues in distant places. Today, some writers now avoid the
 use of ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù like a plague, choosing to euphemize the obvious 
fire that will burn if Nigeria continues along this ruinous path which 
government and its adulterous partners, the Nigerian elite, are leading 
them daily.</p>
<p>Last week, government again exhibited how scared stiff it was with 
that otherwise harmless word, ‚Äúrevolution.‚Äù In a 56-paragraph 
counter-affidavit it filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja last 
Wednesday, government advertised this palpable fear. The 1979 Iranian 
revolution, also known as the Islamic Revolution, which ushered in 
Ayatollah Khomeini, was a pestilence it feared Ibrahim Yaqoub El Zakzaky
 may harbour, the Buhari government confessed in the affidavit.</p>
<p>But, what evoked the Khomeini revolution in Buhari and what similar 
imprimatur do Zak-Zaky‚Äôs activities bear? Why is government this 
frightened? In 1977, Iranians had become very disillusioned with 
Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi, a pro-Western, United States of 
America-backed monarch whose reign gained global notoriety. By October 
of that year, demonstrations against the Shah had reached their apogee 
with civil resistance as strong as twine. The resistance literally 
paralyzed the country in 1978, so much that the Shah was forced to 
abdicate the throne on January 16, 1979. He headed for exile, making him
 the last of the Persian country‚Äôs monarchs. By the time he was leaving,
 however, Shah left a regency council and in the thick of this national 
melee, Khomeini, leader of one of the factions of the revolt, was 
invited, greeted by a tumultuous approval, amid heavy guerilla street 
fighting. On April 1, 1979, Iran officially voted in a referendum to 
become an Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>The Khomeini-led revolution took the globe by surprise because it 
essentially lacked basic ingredients of a revolution. Except for claim 
that it was its modern variant which had side-stepped hitherto-known 
qualifications of a revolution, there was no war, no surrender nor 
defeat; no d√©tente, peasant rebellion nor a military that openly 
advertised its disavowal with the status-quo. This is because, at the 
time, Iran witnessed relative prosperity under the Shah who was 
relatively massively popular. However, Iranians suffocated under Shah‚Äôs 
authoritarian monarchy and since then, it would seem, America had never 
forgiven this overthrow of its stooge.</p>
<p>The cat and mouse game between the leader of Islamic Movement in 
Nigeria, El-Zak Zaky and the Buhari government has provoked attention in
 national discourses since 2015 when government‚Äôs authoritarian weapon 
was brought to bear on him. Born in 1953, Zak-Zaky is said to bear 
several traits of Khomeini. Radicalized during his studentship at the 
Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria between 1976 and 1979, this First Class 
student of Economics was equally hounded as now by successive military 
governments since the 1980s when the seed of revolt was planted in him. 
He is said to be heavily sponsored by the Iranian government and has a 
horde of loyalists who bear inexplicable allegiance to him.</p>
<p>Of a truth, no responsible government should stand by and allow an 
individual or group of persons to make the state ungovernable for it. 
Government has thus deployed all manner of tactics to keep El-Zak-Zaky 
out of circulation. In 2015 during a raid of his Kaduna hideout, 
hundreds of faithful were alleged to have been massacred, provoking mild
 rebuke from the Western world. Recently when public outcry ensured that
 government relaxed its paws on the flesh of the controversial Islamic 
sect leader, Buhari still kept tabs on him, right to a hospital in 
India.</p>
<p>It is with same ferociousness that government has pursued the 
detention of Omoyele Sowore, rights activist and Publisher who has been 
kept in isolation since August 2. Before Justice Nkeonye Maha of the 
Federal High Court in Abuja a few days back, government claimed that 
Sowore was on the verge of toppling the Buhari government. This is 
reminiscent of the vague and rebuttable allegations during the military 
era where alleged coup plotters were executed without prima facie 
evidence of their involvement in alleged government takeovers. Till 
today, it is said that no corroborative evidence was available in the 
conviction of the duo of Major Generals Iliya Bisalla and Mamman Vatsa.</p>
<p>In court papers it filed to keep Sowore in detention, the DSS alleged
 that the Sahara Reporters Publisher was in cahoots with ‚Äúforeign 
collaborators‚Äù who gave him ‚Äúmillions of dollars‚Äù and that they indeed 
met in Dubai, United Arab Emirates on how to topple the Buhari 
government. Sowore immediately disclaimed this allegation and indeed 
said he had never been to the UAE before. But for a tacit judicial 
abetment of tyranny, evidence ought to have been led in defence of this 
claim and in its absence, governmental oppression of an innocent citizen
 established. The question that this provokes is, why does the Buhari 
government dread ‚Äúchange‚Äù this much and why does a government renowned 
for pussy-footing on matters that have to do with the people be in a 
relentless pursuit of self-serving matters it advertises as national 
interest?</p>
<p>In other words, is the detention of El-Zak Zaky and Sowore really a 
matter of national interest? Put differently, is government merely being
 frightened by its own shadows? Is the drive to hold them down a 
continuation of that infernal thirst akin only to military despots‚Äô 
crave to assert themselves? Is the obsession of government with 
‚Äúrevolution‚Äù a fear borne out of unfavourable reports daily dropped at 
the Villa that Nigerians are, more than ever before, persuaded that they
 had reached the end of their tethers and as such, awaiting a spark to 
take their destines in their own hands? These are the questions that beg
 for answers in this resurgence of government‚Äôs penchant to detain and 
hound dissenting voices.</p>
<p>Revolutions or quest to upturn a government other than through the 
ballot box can only work when an incumbent government is working against
 the people. In the Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi example in Iran cited 
above, the Khomeini revolution was able to upstage it because of its 
authoritarianism. Though there was relative peace under the Shah, that 
peace was got through the anvil of oppression of the people. And as the 
clich√© goes, when peace finds no anchor in a society, violence easily 
offers self as a substitute. The way and manner in which the Buhari 
government is going about its resistance to a so-called revolution is 
archaic and incongruent with modern trend. If it deploys the mechanism 
of an equitable governance that is open and accountable, Nigerians 
themselves will fight anyone who advocates any form of governance 
outside of its democratic government. But because all the people see is a
 government managed by cronies, high on propaganda and very low in 
delivery of the basic ingredients of good life, Buhari and his 
co-travellers in this boat become so alien to the people and anyone who 
calls for its alienation receives applauses from them.</p>
<p>As I once said, the Buhari government should deploy its secret 
service goons to dispassionately feel the naked pulse of ordinary 
Nigerians on the street. What is uttered out is worse than the 
irreverent chants of El-Zak Zaky‚Äôs adherents. Unfortunately, those who 
surround government are a bunch of self-centred anarchists whose major 
thirst is the licit and illicit acquisitions they can liberate before 
its nocturnes. Otherwise, they should be man enough to walk up to the 
President and disclose the animosities and angst that have eaten up the 
length and breadth of Nigeria; same people who, barely five years ago, 
saw Buhari as saviour.</p>
<p>FBI 77 AS OUR MIRROR ON THE WALL</p>
<p>Engaging Ibadan, Oyo State capital, popular radio presenter, Edmund 
Obilo, yesterday engaged the trending national shame, American Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI‚Äôs) 77-member list of allegedly fraudulent 
Nigerians which was unveiled last week. The FBI had unsealed the federal
 grand jury list of the US Attorney‚Äôs Office which indicted the 
Nigerians of involvement in fraud ring in the United States. On the list
 is said to be one Chika Odionyenma, earlier in the year appointed by 
the Imo State government as its official. Another suspect on the wanted 
list by the name Jerry Ikogho is said to be a buddy of the current 
federal minister of Niger Delta Affairs, rambunctious Festus Keyamo, a 
known violin through whom the Buhari government sang its irritating 
testimonials to the public.</p>
<p>Keyamo‚Äôs alibi was that he had been friends with Ikogho since youth. 
Africa Reports made a damming verdict of this dalliance between Nigerian
 government and known, established fraudsters last week. The magazine 
said: ‚ÄúNigerian government officials have a long history of associating 
with suspected and convicted criminals, many of whom have been 
re-integrated into society without proper penance for their crimes,‚Äù 
some of whom included an Ogun State-based drug kingpin and shamelessly, 
ex-legislator who was also a ‚Äúformer governorship candidate‚Ä¶ a principal
 character on which the TV showOrange‚Äôs The New Black is based. He 
escaped from a US prison where he had been convicted for drug-related 
charges.‚Äù</p>
<p>The magazine also named an Enugu State-based woman ‚Äúwho, with her 
husband, forfeited $242-million in what was perhaps the most brazen 
fraud outside Nigerian politics‚Äù and who is ‚Äúcurrently chairperson of 
the Enugu State Waste Management Agency (ESWAMA) ‚Ä¶ sentenced to three 
years in prison by a Lagos court,‚Äù and ‚Äúan associate of the late 
dictator Sani Abacha‚Äù who ‚Äú‚Äùwas elected governor of (a) northwestern 
state‚Ä¶ in 2015,‚Äù and who ‚Äúthe year before, the US government froze more 
than $458m embezzled by the late General and laundered by him and 
others.‚Äù The magazine concluded that ‚ÄúPeople in power hobnobbing with 
people of questionable virtues and the metamorphosis of criminals from 
enemies of the state to being agents of the state itself (in Nigeria) 
are worrying trends.‚Äù</p>
<p>Earlier in the month of August, the arrest by same FBI had shocked a 
Nigerian world that had earlier flaunted its plumage like a peacock. 
Obinwanne Okeke, Chief Executive Officer of Invictus Group, earlier in 
2016 announced as making Forbes‚Äô Africa‚Äôs 30 Under 30 List, was arrested
 for conspiracy to commit computer fraud. FBI had begun his 
investigation in July 2018 over a $11m wire fraud he allegedly 
committed. He had allegedly hacked into an account belonging to the CEO 
of Unatrac Holding Limited, an American steel company. Marshall Ward, a 
Special Agent of FBI, in an affidavit deposed, alleged that FBI was 
contacted by representatives of the company upon experiencing the 
fraudulent transfer through a compromised email ‚ÄúBetween April 6 and 
April 20, 2018, the intruder accessed the CFO‚Äôs account at least 464 
times, mostly from Internet Protocol (IP) addresses in Nigeria,‚Äù deposed
 Ward.</p>
<p>Aside Okeke‚Äôs, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC) 
always eager to earn positive rating in the passion of Nigerians, 
immediately began an advertised pursuit of the alleged fraudsters. Some 
are said to have been arrested and multiple of millions retrieved from 
them.</p>
<p>Obilo‚Äôs bother was that, while it is good that these vermin are being
 ferreted out of their hiding places, FBI is not deploying same energy, 
same institutional vivaciousness into repatriation and infliction of 
penance on those leeches in government and their allies who siphon 
Nigerian money to America, United Kingdom and other Western counties. 
Why does FBI announce its clinical efficiency only when these coal-black
 hearted Nigerians fleece America and repatriate the illicit monies to 
Nigeria?</p>
<p>The above question may sound ideological but it burrows into the 
marrows of the inequitable dealings that the Third World faces in the 
hands of the so-called developed nations of the world. For, if the 
fight, the frown and against crimes had been sweeping and equitable, 
Africans would not be smarting from the pestilence of her leaders who 
wire wealth from suffering African nations to the West which fertilize 
their already fecund economies. Obilo reminded his listeners that until 
Mobutu Sese-Seko became a thorn in the flesh of the world and a bad 
advertisement for its interventionism in Africa, the Zairean leader was a
 buddy of America. Indeed, his wealth, which in 1984 was estimated at 
US$5 billion, was safely stashed in western vaults.</p>
<p>The artificial shock that the Nigerian state and its people have been
 exhibiting since the revelation of the embarrassing list was released 
is however the most embarrassing in the orgy of revelations. The Buhari 
government‚Äôs claim that the fraudsters do not represent us as Nigerians 
is the most irresponsible lie I have heard in recent time. Those 
fraudsters are our poster boys as Nigerians. At the risk of sounding 
unpatriotic, only ostrich-hearted Nigerians will claim that the 
revelations caught them unawares. Progressively since the dismantling of
 the federal system of government by the military in 1966 and its 
replacement with unitarism, even up to the pseudo federalism that we 
have since practiced, Nigeria and Nigerians have been sinking into a 
self-erected abyss, the culmination of which is the deification of 
sudden wealth and the incineration of the magic that Nigerians used to 
evocatively claim was inherent in the works of their hands.</p>
<p>The song sang by all the tribes in Nigeria pre-oil boom was akin to 
one sang by late Yoruba Apala music exponent, Ayinla Omowura, where he 
advocated that if a young man wakes up in the morning and is not being 
pursued by a quest, he should pursue the quest. In folklores, proverbs 
and mores, these societies spoke about the waterloo that awaited anyone 
who frenetically sought to get rich with the speed of a cheetah. Today, 
sadly, the table has turned. There is a wide, inexplicable and 
frightening abetment of quick wealth by our society that can only 
indicate that waterloo awaits us at the end of the tunnel. With a laptop
 lumbered across their shoulders, these youths have accesses to the bank
 accounts of people all over the world. They are given recognition, 
support and overt societal cover by virtually everyone, especially those
 who are humbled by the volley of cash at their beck and call, available
 to be thrown at every need.</p>
<p>That is why Okeke and the 77 men on the FBI list mirror us as a 
people. Parents encourage their wards to eke a living by fraud and 
society deifies the fraudulent as worthy ambassadors. This exponential 
veneration of wealth has transcended tribal boundaries. It will be pure 
reductionism to affix a particular tribe to the craze. No one asks 
questions about how the other person amasses/stumbles upon sudden wealth
 any longer. The alibi of the parents for this abetment is that they had
 invested heavily on training these criminals in universities, only for 
them to graduate and become existential burdens to them. Seeking other 
canon for the justification of this criminality, some lap up racial and 
slavery experiences of the black race, maintaining that it is payback 
time for a black race that had been unfairly stultified by the West over
 a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Successive governments are also vicariously liable for this implosion
 in the statistics of the infernal among us. Humongous wealth that 
should forge a tomorrow for the youth is filched and wired to the West 
with a rapacious abandon that could only have emanated from a mentally 
challenged mind. This is why the West is also liable in the ring of 
blames for the criminality it is now advertising.</p>
<p>The only antidote that can whittle the shameful list in the future is
 for a government that is determined and genuinely embarrassed by 
Nigeria‚Äôs unenviable fare in this hall of shame to emerge and commit 
sizeable ounce of national earnings to the tomorrow of youth. Attending 
to the skyrocketing statistics of graduates who leave universities 
yearly without any meaningful employment is in a state of emergency now.
 The criminal ingenuity deployed by these children in defrauding their 
unsuspecting Western victims is amazing. It only shows that the idle 
hands of these bright brained and peripatetic minds are only finding 
fitting anchors. More importantly, we must begin to reintroduce lost 
values of Africa to our society. Or else we are doomed to walk the night
 like a soughing ghost, apology to South African-born anti-apartheid 
writer, Alex La Guma.</p>
