<h1 class="rm-manual"> Pacific scientists planning and planting for a warmer world </h1>
<p>This Earth Day, in communities around the world, the climate 
emergency is not some distant threat but a daily reality. The fallout is
 acutely felt by the people of the Pacific as they try to nurture their 
crops, secure water, protect shorelines and batten down against 
increasingly ferocious storms. Jordyn Beazley reports. </p>
<p>“It’s becoming harder for countries to maintain the crops that we are
 sending them because there is more extreme weather": Ulamila Lutu, 
acting curator for Fiji's Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees.</p>
<p> <span>Story by</span> <a href="https://www.thecitizen.org.au/people/jordyn-beazley">Jordyn Beazley</a> </p>
<p><span>E</span>very day a crew of biologists work their way up and 
down rows of plants lining a small greenhouse in the Fijian capital of 
Suva. The specimens of taro, breadfruit, sweet potatoes, yams, cassava 
and banana they tend are more than they seem.</p>
<p>These plants are the mother stock used to harvest living tissue from 
which new plants are grown. In glass jars inside the laboratory of the <a href="https://pafpnet.spc.int/research-and-extension/the-centre-for-pacific-crops-and-trees-cepact">Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees</a>,
 the tissue is nurtured into plantlets sprouting roots and leaves. These
 are then bundled into sterile bags and shipped across the Pacific 
region, a precious insurance policy in a warming world.</p>
<p>“Now countries are facing the climate emergency we are actually 
seeing how these crops are being more resilient. So, we are building up 
more data as we go”: Acting curator Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees 
Ulamila Lutu</p>
<p>With recurring climate shocks such as drought, tropical cyclones and 
floods decimating food crops across the Pacific, the centre aims to act 
as guardian and nurturer of Pacific plant species. This collection – or 
gene bank, as it’s commonly called – represents the first and only in 
vitro gene bank in the Pacific and is a lifeline for Pacific food 
security.</p>
<p>As the region is hit harder and more frequently by extreme weather, 
and the window for recovery between disasters closes, the centre has its
 work cut out trying to meet escalating need.</p>
<p>Gene banks, or seed banks, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/lack-diversity-lack-funding-seed-banks-face-world-challenges-180959409/)">are facilities that preserve</a>
 plant seeds, cuttings, or genetic materials such as the plant tissue 
harvested by the centre. In their support for plant research and 
breeding, the banks are increasingly being used to bolster food security
 during the climate emergency.</p>
<p>“When I first started, we didn’t have as many requests. But now with 
climate change we have a lot more requests from countries to send 
crops,” says Ulamila Lutu, the acting curator of the Centre, which is 
part of the Pacific Community – a regional organisation owned and 
governed by 26 countries and territories across the region.</p>
<p>“It’s becoming harder for countries to maintain the crops that we are sending them because there is more extreme weather.”</p>
<p>The centre has extended its reach to countries in Asia and the Caribbean who are also in dire need of crops.</p>
<p>“So we’re supporting not just the Pacific, but the world over,” says Lutu.</p>
<p>In April last year, category 5 Tropical Cyclone Harold cut a path of 
destruction through Vanuatu and caused severe flooding in Fiji and 
Tonga, resulting in 27 deaths. One Ni-Vanuatu resident <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/its-all-gone-cyclone-harold-cuts-a-deadly-path-through-vanuatu">told The Guardian</a>:
 “I’ve lived here 13 years, and I’ve never seen anything like it … It’s 
the first time in history we’ve seen it come this high.”</p>
<p>The ministries of agriculture in Fiji and Vanuatu requested taro, 
sweet potato, yam, and banana plantlets from the centre to secure crops 
for regions devastated by the cyclone. The centre is still working 
tirelessly to deliver all 9000 plantlets ordered by Fiji.</p>
<p>When the gene bank’s plantlets are despatched to Pacific countries, 
they’re initially kept in greenhouses the centre has helped countries to
 set up to ensure the young stock can acclimatise to local conditions 
before being sent to communities.</p>
<p>One of the challenges facing the program now, Lutu says, is a 
disconnect between the capacity of the gene bank to provide crucial 
stocks, and the ability of communities to nurture and distribute them 
given limited local government resources.</p>
<p>This speaks to the severe underfunding many Pacific countries are 
facing in their critical agricultural sectors as they try to respond to 
shifting climatic conditions and violent weather events.</p>
<p>The situation is made plain in a recent <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/sites/default/files/document/21960-enhancing-resilience-agriculture-and-food-security-pacific-island-countries-through-managing.pdf">grant application</a>
 by the Pacific Community to the UN’s Green Climate Fund. Arguing for 
support for agriculture and food security programs in Samoa, Fiji, and 
Solomon Islands, it explained that none of these nations had the 
capacity to address the threats posed by global heating.</p>
<p>Lutu says that the increasing impacts of climate heating playing out 
in the region have influenced the gene bank’s focus on finding and 
sharing crop species that can grow faster, produce higher yields, use 
less water and withstand pests, diseases and climate extremes.</p>
<p>The centre is now working on a type of taro collected from Palau that
 was found to fare better in soil contaminated by sea water. Once the 
scientists complete testing on the plant to ensure it is not carrying 
any diseases, it will be available for countries to order.</p>
<p>This story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of
 more than 460 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.</p>
<p>“Now countries are facing the climate emergency we are actually 
seeing how these crops are being more resilient. So, we are building up 
more data as we go,” Lutu says.</p>
<p>The centre is not alone in its bid to save plant species threatened by the climate emergency. There are about <a href="https://www.cgiar.org/news-events/news/guardians-of-diversity-the-network-of-genebanks-helping-to-feed-the-world/">1,750 gene banks</a> around the world, holding a total of around 7.4 million plant materials collected from different species.</p>
<p>There are similar efforts evolving to save species in the natural 
world from spiralling levels of extinction. For instance, Australian 
marine biologist John ‘Charlie’ Veron’s “coral ark” for <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/environment/sustainability/coral-ark-bids-to-save-biodiversity-as-global-threats-to-reefs-mount-20191213-p53jw8.html">coral species in the Great Barrier Reef</a>.
 Rather than collecting coral species to re-plant now, Veron is 
conserving species to re-plant once the ocean is no longer at risk of 
extreme heat waves.</p>
<p>With the Pacific region already experiencing the devastating impacts 
of the climate emergency as a consequence of the rise in global 
temperatures of 1.1 degrees above pre-industrial levels, Lutu says the 
question of how to support food security is an urgent issue for the 
centre.</p>
<p>“The best we can do right now is to support countries with what we 
have and pray it will help them survive with the conditions of climate 
change.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">This week, through an initiative called <a href="https://coveringclimatenow.org/">Covering Climate Now</a>,
 news organisations around the world have highlighted stories from 
around the world of the realities of living through the climate 
emergency. The Citizen is a partner in the CCN initiative, lead by
