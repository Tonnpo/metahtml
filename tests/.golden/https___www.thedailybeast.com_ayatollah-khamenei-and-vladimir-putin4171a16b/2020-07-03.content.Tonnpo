<h1 class="rm-manual">Ayatollah Khamenei and Vladimir Putin</h1>
<p class="">Little stands in the way of Ayatollah Khamenei’s nuclear ambitions-- and quest for absolute power.</p>

<p>In Shiism, there is a strange concept called “Mohallel.” If a man 
divorces his wife in earnest—“thrice-divorced” in the parlance of Shiite
 Sharia—he can’t remarry her unless she has married and divorced another
 man. Rich men who divorce their wives in a fit of madness and then feel
 remorse and want them back often have to pay a reliable man a sum to be
 their Mohallel—“marry” the thrice-divorced wife with due discretion and
 then divorce her. There is a usually a retinue of “reliable” Mohalells 
in each pious community.</p>
<p>Russia and Iran are both ruled by men seeking absolute power—<a href="file:///content/dailybeast/articles/2011/09/24/putin-to-run-for-president-of-russia-again-in-elections-next-year.html">Vladimir Putin</a>
 in Moscow and Ayatollah Khamenei in Iran. And both are now shedding any
 vestige of a democratic appearance. Putin’s Mohallel, Dmitry Medvedev, 
will be prime minister and his boss, Putin, will again take the reins of
 power. In Tehran, Khamenei is making his own powerplay—and all of this 
is likely to help the clerics achieve their dubious nuclear aims.</p>
<p>In the past four years, if there has been an obvious area of 
difference between Putin and Medvedev, it has been on Iran’s clerical 
regime. Medvedev has been more willing to work with the United States 
and the European Union on pressuring Iran to give up troubling aspects 
of its nuclear program. He even decided not to sell the clerical regime 
the S-300 missiles that would have substantially increased Iran’s 
ability to protect its nuclear sites from air attacks.</p>
<p>In Iran, more than six years ago, Ayatollah Khamenei handpicked 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to be his political Mohallel—Ahmadinejad was meant 
to play the role of the pliant president and permit Khamenei to 
consolidate his power grab even further. (The clerical quest for control
 over society is so notorious and brazen at this point it has even 
reached the realm of literature. A few years ago, Khamenei ordered the 
death of a writer named Saidi Sirjani who had dared to write a brilliant
 satire about a venerable man of devotion exchanging his pious soul for 
profane power.) Ahmadinejad was picked to hide Khameni’s insatiable 
appetite for more power.</p>
<p>But as it sometimes happens in the topsy-turvy world of professional 
Mohallels, Ahmadinejad ended up having a passionate desire for power 
himself. He increasingly proved unwilling to play his expected role. He 
continued to challenge Khamenei. A few weeks ago, the Iranian 
parliament, again, of course, handpicked by Khamenei, was ready to 
impeach the impudent Mohallel. But the instability that might come with 
such a move—and the possibility that impeachment procedures would 
empower the opposition—convinced Khamenei and his allies in the military
 to temporarily pull in their punches.</p>
<p>Then, a couple of days ago, a conservative member of the parliament 
who is generally thought to speak for Khamenei revealed the remarkable 
fact that a group of lawmakers has been thinking about doing away with 
the office of presidency—for awhile. With a Leader like Khamenei, he 
said, why do we need a president? They want to replace the job of 
presidency, elected by direct vote, with that of a prime minister, 
chosen by a pliant parliament who would appoint, and dismiss, any man 
the ayatollah sees fit.</p>
<p>Direct election of the president by the people was one of the few 
concessions the clerics made when they seized power in 1979; it was a 
necessary bow to the democratic nature and aspirations of the revolution
 that brought them to power. But they of course placed a 
disproportionate share of power in the hands of the clerical Leader—not 
elected by the people, and not impeachable. Ever since then, clerics 
have followed an incessant effort to further curtail people’s rights. 
The first step was to require every candidate to pass “the beneficent 
supervision” (Nezarate Estesvabi) of a 12-man body controlled by the 
Leader. But the corrupting influence of absolute power begets an 
insatiable appetite for more power. After the most recent fiasco with 
Ahmadinejad—or more specifically when the Mohallel proved unwilling to 
“divorce” power when Khamenei asked him to—the Leader has apparently 
decided to throw caution to the wind and do away with the office of 
president altogether. Moreover, this serious curtailment of democracy 
will be taking place just as the Muslim world is witnessing what could 
be its most important tectonic shift toward democracy.</p>
<p>The stories of these two Mohallels—the pliant one in Russia and the 
reluctant one in Iran—are connected not just because they both make a 
mockery of democracy and the people’s right to vote. In Iran, Khamenei 
has been the most intransigent force in shaping Iran’s policy toward the
 U.S. and on the country’s nuclear program. In Russia, Putin has been 
more willing than Medvedev to challenge and embarrass the U.S. and align
 Russia with Iran and China in a new brotherhood of despotism. The rise 
of Putin in Russia will only give Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary
 Guard Corps' brazen power grab a longer lease on life, and the past 
three decades have shown the Iranian regime to be an indefatigable foe 
of democracy and diplomatic decorum in the Middle East and around the 
world.</p>
