<p class="rm-manual">Commentary</p>
<p>For more than 30 years, U.S. presidents have known that <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-iran">Iran</a>
 was a state sponsor of terrorism. U.S. officials frequently spoke about
 how Iran hosted al-Qaida operatives, permitting them to move money and 
fighters to South Asia and Syria.</p>
<p>Last year, a U.N. Security Council report found that al-Qaida leaders
 based in Iran “have grown more prominent” in projecting authority and 
dictating orders to groups in other countries. The United States even 
imposed sanctions on Iran’s military and intelligence agencies because 
of its support for terror groups.</p>
<p>Never before, however, has an administration done what <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-president-donald-trump">President Donald Trump</a>
 did when he designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a
 Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). This is the first time that the 
United States has labeled part of another government as an FTO, and it 
puts the IRGC into the same category as al-Qaida and ISIS.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-holding-iranian-regime-accountable-global-campaign-terrorism/">According</a>
 to the White House, this move is intended to “increase the financial 
pressure and isolation of Iran and deprive the regime of resources it 
uses for its terrorist activities.”</p>
<p>The IRGC, an official part of the Iranian military, is one of Iran’s 
three armed forces. It was created after Iran’s 1979 revolution and is 
charged with protecting the country’s Islamic Republic system by 
preventing foreign interference or coups from within. The IRGC has about
 125,000 members. It consists of ground forces, an air force, naval 
units, missiles, and drone forces, and reports directly to the Supreme 
Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>As with organizations such as ISIS, al-Qaida, and Boko Haram, the 
IRGC has been accused of grave human-rights violations, such as 
beheading victims, stoning them, burning people alive, hangings, 
torture, and dismemberment. Furthermore, this treatment has allegedly 
been meted out to innocent non-combatants without trials, hearings, or 
any kind of due process. Terrorists seek to instill terror and 
submission, not provide justice. That’s exactly what the IRGC has done.</p>
<p>The IRGC conducts commercial activity in Iran, controlling about 20 
percent of the country’s economy. That’s where the U.S. terrorist 
designation may hurt the most, because it’s a crime to do business with 
an FTO-designated organization. Therefore, banks, corporations, and 
financial institutions will have to be careful if they do business in 
Iran. Funds can be frozen, individuals can be prosecuted, and 
immigration restrictions can be placed on anyone who is linked to the 
IRGC.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said, “If you’re the general 
counsel for a European financial institution today, there’s more risk.”</p>
<p>Several commentators have argued that the FTO label won’t accomplish 
much more than the sanctions already in place will do. The Trump 
administration announced “the highest level of economic sanction” in May
 2018, and many Western corporations have already withdrawn from Iran. 
Inflation and unemployment are skyrocketing, with sanctions compounding 
the burdens on an economy suffering from mismanagement and corruption. 
How much worse can it get?</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the George W. Bush administration designated 
the IRGC’s elite foreign operations wing, Quds Force, a “specially 
designated global terrorist” in 2007. Canada. Egypt, and the kingdoms of
 Saudi Arabia and Bahrain all followed suit. Other nations are also 
likely to join with the new designation from the Trump administration. 
On the eve of elections in Israel that led to his unprecedented fifth 
term, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked President Trump
 for his action, as did leaders from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The decision to label the IRGC as an FTO came one year after the 
Trump administration announced that it was withdrawing from the 
Obama-era nuclear agreement with Iran. That was a very controversial 
move, as was the original agreement, which arguably overlooked Iran’s 
historic support for terrorism and focused solely on nuclear weapons. 
However, after completing the negotiations regarding Iran’s nuclear 
program in 2015, the IRGC became even more aggressive in supporting 
terrorist proxies in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. The issue could no
 longer be ignored.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-designation-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-foreign-terrorist-organization/">said</a>
 the FTO designation “underscores the fact that Iran’s actions are 
fundamentally different from those of other governments.” His strategy 
starts with the recognition that Iran is an outlaw state, and a large 
part of its military is indistinguishable from those terrorist groups 
that it has been sponsoring for several decades. As such, the United 
States will treat Iran as a terrorist nation until it changes its 
behavior.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Iranian officials responded in a predictable manner, 
with the Foreign Minister saying that Iran’s Supreme National Security 
Council would designate Central Command, the overseer of U.S. armed 
forces in the region, as a “terrorist organization.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/designating-iran-s-revolutionary-guard-terror-group-could-jeopardize-u-n992356">NBC News</a>,
 lawmakers dressed in military uniforms met, chanted “death to America” 
during an open session of parliament, and passed an emergency bill 
requesting countries that take U.S troops into custody hand them over to
 Iran to face trial as terrorists.</p>
<p>This may be simple “tit-for-tat” between the two nations, but what 
are the implications for soldiers from either nation? The concept of 
“just warfare” can be traced back to at least the 13th century, and it 
extends through the Geneva Convention up to today. Among the basic ideas
 is that a soldier fighting in uniform, under a chain of command, and 
not hiding among the civilian population, is to be treated with a higher
 degree of respect than a spy, terrorist, or so-called “illegal” 
officer.</p>
<p>The idea is that when fighting can’t be avoided, we want to encourage
 it to be done in a more humane manner. For that reason, those who fight
 as true soldiers receive Prisoner of War status, but that status is 
denied to terrorists or enemy combatants.</p>
<p>So how would the United States treat IRGC soldiers who may or may not
 be identified by wearing insignia indicating affiliation with the 
Guard? Are they entitled to protections under the Geneva Convention? 
(The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that they are entitled to some rights in 
Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 2006). Perhaps most importantly, how would Iran 
treat an American G.I.? (In the recent past, it has been with great 
brutality.)</p>
<p>This isn’t an academic question. For almost two decades, Iran has 
expanded its influence in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. 
In the process, it has operated close to U.S. forces, often in 
adversarial positions. Now that the IRGC is considered an FTO, will the 
United States take aggressive action against it? IRGC leaders have a 
legitimate reason to fear so.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Pompeo has <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2019/04/290987.htm">said</a>
 that Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the IRGC Quds Force, “has the blood
 of Americans on his hands.” Pompeo has pledged to pursue him just as 
the United States does the leadership of ISIS.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this knowledge won’t prompt Iran to strike first. One must
 also hope that Iranian nuclear operations don’t yet pose a serious 
threat to the world. If, however, the plan is to combat terrorism, the 
truth must clearly be stated.</p>
<p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The administration is justified in saying so.</p>
