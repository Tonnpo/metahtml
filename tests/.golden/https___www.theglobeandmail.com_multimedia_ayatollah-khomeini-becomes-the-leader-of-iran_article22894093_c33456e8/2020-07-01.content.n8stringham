<p>Jubilant throngs lined Tehran’s broad boulevards to hail Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini on his triumphal return from exile. The Shah had fled,
 and the Shiite imam vowed to sweep aside the blasphemous remnants of a 
ruthless regime that lavished wealth on a few while most Iranians lived 
in poverty.</p>
<p>The aging cleric wasn’t just a revered religious leader. In exile, 
he’d mastered social media long before the term was invented, laying the
 groundwork for his Islamic revolution with thousands of cassette tapes 
that secretly circulated in Iran. The austere Ayatollah Khomeini was 
installed as Supreme Leader, ushering in a still-unfinished era of 
theocratic rule and international isolation that transformed the 
region’s most powerful state into an international pariah. </p>
