<p class="rm-manual">Police officers and soldiers check passengers leaving from Milan main train station, Italy, on March 9, 2020. </p>
<p class="rm-manual">The Associated Press</p>
<p>All of Italy, a Group of Seven country and the world’s eighth-largest
 economy, was placed in lockdown Monday night after a surge in Italian 
COVID-19 infections and fatalities alarmed all of Europe and eliminated 
any hope that the virus outside China was on the verge of being 
contained.</p>
<p>The national lockdown was imposed less than two days after Prime 
Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree that sealed off much of wealthy 
northern Italy, including Milan, and is the only quarantine of an entire
 country since the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 erupted in 
Wuhan, China, in December.</p>
<p>The lockdown will severely restrict the movements and office life of 
60 million Italian citizens, four times the number of citizens who had 
been confined in northern Italy since early Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Italy has been fighting a losing battle to contain the virus, which 
began hitting the country hard about two weeks ago, when 11 northern 
towns, most of them near Milan, were placed in quarantine. Sealing off 
those towns, and later much of the entire north, failed to halt the 
spread of the disease through Italy and into nearby countries.</p>
<p>By Monday, the latest tally put the number of confirmed cases in 
Italy at about 9,200 – up almost 1,800 over the previous 24 hours – with
 463 fatalities, up by 97. Italy now has more confirmed cases and 
fatalities than any country other than China, where the new infection 
rate has slowed substantially in recent days. China recorded just 44 new
 cases on Monday.</p>

<p>In a televised address Monday night, Mr. Conte said: “We’re having an
 important growth in infection ... and of deaths. We all must give 
something up for the good of Italy. We have to do it now, and we’ll only
 be able if we all collaborate and adapt to these more stringent 
measures."</p>
<p>The national restrictions are the same as those imposed in the north.
 Italians have to adopt what Mr. Conte described as an “I stay home” 
policy. The quarantine decree will keep schools, universities, museums, 
cinemas, theatres, pools and public events on shutdown until at least 
April 3. People will be forbidden to assemble in public and go to 
nightclubs. Soccer games will be suspended. Only essential travel, and 
travel for family emergencies, will be allowed.</p>
<p>The number of coronavirus cases worldwide reached 114,000 on Monday, 
with more than 4,000 deaths. In Europe, France, Spain, Germany, Britain,
 Netherlands and the micro-state of San Marino reported new deaths. 
Spain’s new COVID-19 cases, at 555, were the second highest jump on the 
continent, after Italy.</p>
<p>Germany, which reported its first two deaths, urged citizens to work 
from home and avoid public transportation. Tunisia reported five 
COVID-19 cases. Tunisians are blaming Italians for bringing the disease 
to their country.</p>
<p>The virus outbreak has almost certainly thrust Italy into recession, 
one that would be its fourth since the 2008 financial crisis, economists
 say. The economy was already on the verge of sustained downturn late 
last year, when it shrank by 0.3 per cent.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Milan stock exchange lost 11 per cent as investors, 
spooked by the plunge in oil prices and bond yields, took flight. 
Equities in the United States and Britain posted their steepest fall 
since 2008. The Italian markets could plunge again on Tuesday, since Mr.
 Conte announced the national quarantine after the Italian markets 
closed.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy also triggered riots in dozens of 
overcrowded prisons, resulting in deaths and extensive damage as the 
disease raised tensions and fear across the country.</p>
<p>The riots broke out on Saturday in a prison in Salerno, south of 
Naples, and spread to about 30 other prisons by Monday. The worst-hit 
prison was in Modena, a wealthy city in northern Italy whose nearby 
industries include race-car maker Ferrari. Six Modena prisoners died 
after they broke in to an infirmary and overdosed on methadone, an 
opioid whose misuse can be fatal.</p>
<p>The prisoners rioted after restrictions were placed on temporary 
leave permits and family prison visits – efforts to prevent the spread 
of COVID-19 in prisons, where the tight quarters would virtually 
guarantee the disease’s quick transmission.</p>
<p>In Naples, home of the infamous Poggioreale prison, where many 
Mafiosi are locked down, friends and relatives of the inmates gathered 
outside to protest against the banned family visits. Some of them 
climbed onto the roof of the prison.</p>
<p>At the Modena prison, two guards were injured in addition to the 
prisoner fatalities. At the Torre del Gallo prison in Pavia, south of 
Milan, two guards were temporarily taken hostage. Prisoners stole their 
keys to release fellow prisoners.</p>
<p>Human-rights advocates had warned that the coronavirus-related 
restrictions on prisoners were putting great stress on them. In a 
statement, human-rights group Antigone said, “We had already warned 
tensions were growing in prisons, and that we feared it could end in 
tragedy."</p>
<p>OSAPP, the Italian prison guards’ union, said in a statement Monday 
afternoon that the riots had been quelled. It added that fires and 
vandalism had done “incalculable damage” to four prisons, including 
Modena and Naples Poggioreale. OSAPP was highly critical of the 
government, accusing it of providing no support to the prisons during a 
disease crisis that agitated inmates.</p>
<p>The government later announced that it will distribute 100,000 face 
masks to the penitentiary system, starting Tuesday. A medical devices 
company in Bologna, Siare Engineering International, received an 
emergency government order for 2,000 respirators. Respirators have saved
 the lives of many critical patients.</p>
<p>By Monday, 34 U.S. states had reported more than 600 COVID-19 cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p>
