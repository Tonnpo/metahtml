<h1 class="rm-manual">Dictator-lit: The poetry of Ayatollah Khomeini</h1>
<p class="rm-manual">Better known for his contributions to religion, 
revolution and world politics, Iran's supreme leader took literary 
criticism to new lengths. And wrote some surprising poems</p>

<p class="rm-manual"><span>Published on </span>Fri 29 Jan 2010 05.30 EST</p>
<p>The fourth instalment in an occasional series on books written by 
some of the world's most notorious dictators. The author's goal is to 
subject himself to as much tyrant prose as he can bear, reporting back 
on his findings until the will to live deserts him.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous literary critic of the 20th century, 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (1902-1989) was renowned for his vehement 
loathing of the work of Salman Rushdie. Indeed, the Ayatollah (or Imam, 
as he liked to be known) loathed the Satanic Verses so much that he 
called for Rushdie's execution. Now Rushdie may seem a bit smug, but I 
think we can all agree that that was going a bit far. And as a British 
subject and lapsed Sunni Muslim, Rushdie was not under the Iranian Shia 
supreme leader's jurisdiction by any stretch of the imagination. Nor had
 the Ayatollah actually read the Satanic Verses. No surprise there, of 
course – ignorance of the offending material is a sine qua non for those
 who would burn books and kill their authors.</p>
<p>But I digress. Today I am focusing not on the Ayatollah's critical 
output, but rather his work as a creative author, which is woefully 
unknown in the western world, even though he was stupendously prolific 
(200 of his works are available online). The topics he covered include 
commentaries on the <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/anthology/translator.htm">Qur'an and the Hadith</a>,
 works on Islamic law, plus multiple tomes on philosophy, gnosticism, 
poetry, literature and politics. And on top of all that he masterminded 
one of the epochal <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iranian-revolution">events of the 20th century</a>. Not bad – from a Protestant work ethic standpoint, at least. </p>
<p>Prolific output is no sign of quality however, as anyone who has read Khomeini's fellow dictator <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/sep/03/dictator-lit-hoxha-on-stalin">Enver Hoxha</a>
 will attest. But it is difficult for those of us not fluent in Persian 
to arrive at a judgment on Khomeini's work as so little of it is 
available in translation. Indeed, it's almost as if the authorities in 
the Islamic Republic don't want us to read his books, as if they don't 
care whether we are converted or not. This is an unusual, even 
refreshing display of contempt for the lingua franca of the modern 
world, as almost every other tyrant from Muammar Gaddafi to Islam 
Karimov of Uzbekistan has revealed his cultural insecurity by having his
 words rendered into the language of the Great (and little) Satan. </p>
<p>Back to the Ayatollah however, and what is available in English. </p>
<p>• In 1980, Bantam Books published an unauthorised paperback entitled 
The Little Green Book: Sayings of the Ayatollah Khomeini, hastily 
compiled in the aftermath of the revolution. This slim volume lifted 
freely from three separate works by Khomeini: Kingdom of the Learned, 
Key to Mysteries and The Explanation of Problems. Problems with the text
 are manifold. The English version was translated from Iranian into 
French into English, and greatly truncated in the process: 125 pages 
instead of over 1,000, with a suspicious emphasis on aphorisms about 
semen, sweat and the anus. To compound matters, it does not attribute 
specific quotes. And yet in spite of these serious flaws the immensely 
vengeful, tedious, depressing, obsessive, paranoid, superstitious, 
reactionary, authoritarian, misogynistic and antisemitic flavour of the 
Ayatollah's thought shines through. No wonder many in Iran, forced to 
submit to one man's withering interpretation of their cultural and 
religious inheritance (and that is to say nothing of non-Muslims and 
unbelievers) are rioting in the streets.</p>
<p>• On the other hand, Islam and Revolution (Mazar, 1981) was compiled 
by an editor favourably inclined to Khomeini (Hamid Algar, author of the
 classic Occidentosis: The Plague from the West). I stumbled upon it in 
the Austin public library and was just about to read the thing when 
alas, somebody put in a call for it and I had to return it. 
Optimistically listed as Volume 1, Volume 2 – as far as I can tell – was
 never published.</p>
<p>• Finally, my desperate quest for more Khomeini led me to this singular, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/14/books/mullah-as-mystic.html?pagewanted=1">solitary poem</a>,
 originally published in the New Republic in 1989, just as the Ayatollah
 was demanding death for Rushdie and poised to take the great leap into 
eternity himself. This was what I was really interested in – something 
that would reveal a side of Khomeini unknown to those of us in the west;
 a more tender aspect of the bearded, reactionary theocrat.</p>
<p>And what a poem! If the first two lines are startling: </p>
<p>I have become imprisoned, O beloved, by the mole on your lip! I saw your ailing eyes and became ill through love.</p>
<p>Then what follows a few lines down is absolutely amazing: </p>
<p>Open the door of the tavern and let us go there day and night, For I am sick and tired of the mosque and seminary. </p>
<p>The whole thing ends with a repudiation of Islam in favour of the "tavern's idol". </p>
<p>Even allowing for the fact that the Ayatollah is utilising a poetic 
persona, the poem is remarkable: free thinking, even heretical. And yet …
 according to Khomeini's Arabic translator, professor Muhammad Ala 
al-Din Mansur, of Cairo University, the apparently secular tone is 
misleading: </p>
<p>Imam Khomeini's poetry was exclusively a means for the manifestation 
of his mystical and numinous thoughts while praying to God and 
reflecting on the mysteries of the creation.</p>
<p>And sure enough, I soon found <a href="http://www.najaf.org/english/book/16/29.htm">an essay online</a>
 in which the critic revealed that everything in the poem is something 
else, and nothing is what it appears to be. Bummer. But is Khomeini's 
stuff any good? According to <a href="http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=2037">a pro-regime site</a>:</p>
<p>Imam Khomeini was an outstanding poet and literary figure of Persian 
language. His prose was elegant and his poetry delicate. He was popular 
in this respect from the very beginning of his student days in Qum and 
was known for the soundness of his speech and writings.</p>
<p>But they would say that, wouldn't they? As for those of us who don't 
speak Persian, how are we to judge? Which leads me to a final thought: 
considering so little of Khomeini's thought is available in English 
(even though he established the ideology of a major hegemon in today's 
Middle East) – what exactly are all our analysts, specialists and 
decision-makers consulting when they make pronouncements about the 
place? I don't believe for one second that the hacks writing op-eds and 
the politicians appearing on talk shows speak Persian. </p>
<p>My guess is that they are very often reading interpretations of 
interpretations, pieces a little like this, albeit longer and written 
with a note of certainty. And that – frankly – should have us all 
concerned. </p>
