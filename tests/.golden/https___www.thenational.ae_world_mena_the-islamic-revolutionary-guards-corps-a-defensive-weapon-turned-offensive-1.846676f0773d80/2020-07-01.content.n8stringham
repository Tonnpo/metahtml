<p>As an exiled cleric, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini spent his wilderness
 years planning what an Islamic Republic would look like. By the time he
 returned to Iran, thunderously in 1979, he had decided that security 
would not be left to military men who had served Shah Mohamed Reza 
Pahlavi.</p>
<p>Instead, he <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/the-americas/united-states-designates-iran-s-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-as-a-terrorist-organisation-1.846568">founded a force of guardians</a>
 who would be loyal to him. Calling them the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guards Corps (IRGC), drawn from the pious and often poorest Shiite 
neighbourhoods, their job was to protect the new republic from any 
threat at home or abroad. In the past 40 years it has done both.</p>
<p>Until his death in 1989, the force answered to Khomeini. And ever 
since its commander-in-chief has been supreme leader Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei. The stipulation that the IRGC reports to a religious leader 
rather than the country's elected president is testament to two things: 
Khomeini’s paranoia about a coup being led by men in uniform still loyal
 to the Shah, and his determination that the revolution never be undone.</p>
<p>The IRGC's principal task – from inception – is that Iran remains an Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>The IRGC, which is said to number about 120,000 among its land, air 
and naval divisions, established its credentials as a fighting force 
during the Iran-Iraq War. Defending the country – into a stalemate 
against the much-better supplied forces of Saddam Hussein – naturally 
endeared its members to Iranians.</p>
<p>Those who died – always referred to as martyrs – are commemorated on 
murals in cities, particularly in Tehran. The reverence is sincere among
 all Iranians. Much more contentious are the IRGC's activities abroad. 
The bombings of the US Marine barracks and the American embassy in 
Beirut, attributed to Lebanon's Shiite militia Hezbollah, were made 
possible by Iranian support and training.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">Numerous assassinations abroad have been blamed on 
the IRGC's elite foreign wing, the Quds Force headed by Maj Gen Qasem 
Soleimani, the man who has overseen Iran’s campaign in the Syrian war. 
But the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 would lead to anti-US militias 
receiving Iranian training and weapons that would later kill American 
forces. The IRGC's organisational and fighting skills were pivotal to 
saving Syrian President Bashar Al Assad's regime.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">As is usually the case, the Iranian force operated 
in the shadows, initially denying any role at all in Syria. When it no 
longer could do so it downplayed its influence before conducting a 
calibrated attempt to capitalise on its appeal among a nationalist 
audience at home.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The role of the IRGC in Iran's economy, however, 
has never been popular among the wider Iranian population. Corruption is
 endemic. US and European sanctions imposed during the presidency of 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-2013) – on account of Iran's nuclear programme
 – increased the IRGC's clout as it controlled borders and expanded its 
business interests.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Iran's subsequent president, Hassan Rouhani, is an 
unpopular figure among the IRGC's highest echelons as he has tried to 
limit their non-military activities but he has always been one step 
behind what has become an economic leviathan. The IRGC knows that 
Iranian presidents come and go, while the supreme leader – Iran has had 
only two in 40 years – will remain its only master.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The US designation of the IRGC as a foreign 
terrorist organisation could hit its economic interests. But it could 
also awaken the defensive instincts that Khomeini considered the force's
 reason for being. If the latter happens, the Quds Force would be at the
 forefront of any attempt to inflict damage on any forces deemed a 
threat.</p>
