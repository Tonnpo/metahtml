</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><span><a href="https://www.theperiscopenews.com/news/">News</a></span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.theperiscopenews.com/author/admin/"> <span>By Admin</span> </a> <span>On Apr 21, 2020</span> <span> 18</span><a href="https://www.theperiscopenews.com/2020/04/21/north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-in-grave-danger-after-heart-surgery/#respond"> 0</a></p>
<p>Fears were growing for Kim Jong-un’s health today after a US official
 said the dictator could be in ‘grave danger’ after heart surgery – 
although South Korea has played down the reports. </p>
<p>Washington is monitoring intelligence that Kim is in a critical 
condition after his operation, CNN quoted an unnamed US official as 
saying. </p>
<p>Kim, 36, was last seen at a government meeting on April 11, and was 
mysteriously absent from the celebration of his late grandfather Kim 
Il-Sung’s birthday on April 15.</p>
<p>Daily NK, an outlet run mostly by North Korean defectors, said Kim 
had undergone a cardiovascular procedure and was recovering at a villa 
in North Phyongan province. </p>
<p>It is unclear what would happen next if fears that Kim is 
‘incapacitated or worse’ prove correct, but his sister Kim Yo-jong is 
among the senior politicians who could be in line to take control. </p>
<p>South Korea has today played down the fears over Kim’s health, saying
 that ‘no special movement has been detected inside North Korea’. </p>
<p>The South’s Yonhap news agency cited an unnamed government official saying that reports Kim was seriously ill were ‘not true’. </p>
<p>The North has imposed even tighter restrictions than usual because of
 the coronavirus pandemic – although it claims to have no cases. </p>
<p>Kim Jong Un is in grave danger after a surgery says a US official 
with direct knowledge of the North Korean leader’s condition. He is seen
 speaking at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee 
of the Workers’ Party of Korea on April 11, his last appearance in 
public </p>
<p>Senior party and government officials celebrate the 108th anniversary
 of founder Kim Il-Sung’s birth in Pyongyang on April 15 – a ceremony 
which Kim Jong-un inexplicably missed </p>
<p>South Korea’s presidential Blue House said: ‘We have no information 
to confirm regarding rumours about Chairman Kim Jong-un’s health issue 
that have been reported by some media outlets. </p>
<p>‘Also, no unusual developments have been detected inside North Korea.’</p>
<p>The Blue House later said Kim was believed to be staying at an 
unspecified location outside of Pyongyang with some of his close 
confidants. </p>
<p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing was aware
 of reports about the health of Kim, but said it does not know their 
source, without commenting on whether it has any information about the 
situation. </p>
<p>A different US official, speaking to the Associated Press, said the 
White House was already aware of fears about Kim’s health before the 
latest reports surfaced on Monday night. </p>
<p>The official said the US had information that Kim may have undergone 
surgery and that complications may have rendered him ‘incapacitated or 
worse’. </p>
<p>But they stressed that the US had nothing to confirm whether the 
surgery had taken place or that any complications had occurred. </p>
<p>‘We just don’t know,’ said the official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. The White House and State Department had no comment. </p>
<p>Daily NK, citing unidentified sources inside the isolated state, said
 Kim was recovering at a villa in the Mount Kumgang resort county of 
Hyangsan on the east coast after getting the procedure on April 12 at a 
hospital there. </p>
<p>Kim’s health has deteriorated in recent months due to heavy smoking, obesity and overwork, the Daily NK report said.</p>
<p>‘My understanding is that he had been struggling (with cardiovascular
 problems) since last August but it worsened after repeated visits to 
Mount Paektu,’ a source was quoted as saying, referring to the country’s
 sacred mountain. </p>
<p>The dictator’s health fears come after reports that North Korean 
authorities had admitted in public lectures that coronavirus was 
spreading in the country, contradicting the regime’s claims that there 
are no cases. </p>
<p>There was no indication that Kim had contracted the deadly respiratory disease, also known as COVID-19. </p>
<p>The Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, said
 it couldn’t confirm another report by Daily NK, which cited anonymous 
sources to report that Kim was recovering from heart surgery in the 
capital Pyongyang and that his condition was improving. </p>
<p>Losing the dictator could leave the nuclear power in a vulnerable 
position as it scrambles to replace Kim Jong. Among those who are 
believed to be successors is his sister, Kim Yo-jong, pictured meeting 
South Korean officials in the border village of Panmunjom last year </p>

<h3>Rise to power of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un </h3>
<p>Born in 1983 or 1984, Kim Jong-un is the second child of Kim Jong-il who ruled North Korea from 1994 until his death in 2011. </p>
<p>He is also the grandson of the authoritarian state’s founder Kim Il-sung, who ruled from 1948 to 1994. </p>
<p>Growing up, he was described by household staff as a trash-talking 
basketball player and Super Mario fan who wore a pistol on his waist 
aged 11 as he watched James Bond movies. </p>
<p>The ‘little dictator’ was treated by his late father with video games, pinball machines and a luxurious cinema. </p>
<p>Kim Jong-il ensured his son ‘grew up thinking he was special,’ 
Washington Post journalist Anna Fifield describes in her biography, The 
Great Successor: The Secret Rise and Rule of Kim Jong Un. </p>
<p>The young Kim also studied at a Swiss boarding school under an 
assumed name, but as the second child he was not widely expected to 
succeed his father. </p>
<p>However, his older brother Kim Jong-nam is thought to have fallen out
 of favour after he was he was deported from Japan in 2001 on suspicion 
of trying to use a fake passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He would 
later be assassinated in Malaysia in 2017. </p>
<p>By 2010, Kim Jong-un was being described as a ‘leader-in-waiting’ 
after he was appointed to senior political and military posts. His 
father had suffered a stroke in 2008. </p>
<p>State media began celebrating Kim Jong-un as ‘the young general’, even though his military experience appeared to be zero. </p>
<p>When his father died in late 2011, Kim was quickly hailed as the 
‘Great Successor’ and the ruling party issued orders to unite ‘under the
 leadership of our comrade Kim Jong-un’. </p>
<p>His uncle Jang Song-thaek was later executed in 2013 for allegedly plotting to seize power. </p>
<p>South Korea’s government-backed Institute for National Security 
Strategy says Kim has purged more than 300 people since taking power. </p>
<p>The dictator’s death or incapacitation would likely result in a power
 struggle because Kim has not specifically named a successor. </p>
<p>Among those who are seen as likely candidates who may try to take the top leadership position are Kim’s sister, Kim Yo-jong.</p>
<p>She was named as an alternate member of the politburo at the April 11
 meeting where Kim was last seen in public, and has represented the 
North Korean government in dealings with the South. </p>
<p>Analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at the private Sejong Institute in South 
Korea said Kim Yo-jong is already exercising significant influence 
within the government. </p>
<p>However, it is thought more likely that a top party leader would take over from Kim. </p>
<p>Given that two of the three members of the Politburo Standing 
Committee are older, its third member, Chairman of the Organization and 
Guidance Department Choe Ryong Hae, is seen as a likely candidate, 
reports NKNews. </p>
<p>Upon the sudden death of Kim Jong-Un, formal rules and regulations in
 the system will likely play a role in deciding who will replace him.</p>
<p>If the leadership is split on a candidate, there may be a formal vote by the Central Committee.</p>
<p>A session of the Supreme People’s Assembly also could be convened to elect a head of state.</p>
<p>However, those votes would likely be formalities after the real 
decision was made elsewhere, possibly fuelling a power struggle. </p>
<p>Speculation about Kim’s health was first raised after he missed the 
celebration of his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung’s 
birthday on April 15.</p>
<p>Kim failed to attend the annual Day of the Sun ceremony for the first
 time, sparking speculation about his health amid the coronavirus 
pandemic.</p>
<p>The celebration and holiday to mark the birth of his grandfather is 
deeply significant and Kim Jong-Un has not missed it since taking power 
in 2011.</p>
<p>Neither Kim nor his sister attended the ceremony at the Kumsusan 
Palace of the Sun, despite many of his senior officials appearing at the
 wreath laying. </p>

<h3>Key events of Kim Jong-un’s rule in North Korea </h3>
<p><span>December 2011</span>: Former leader Kim Jong-il dies and is immediately succeeded by his son Kim Jong-un. </p>
<p><span>April 2012</span>: An attempted North Korean rocket launch crashes into the sea in an embarrassment for the regime. </p>
<p><span>December 2013</span>: Kim’s influential uncle Jang Song-thaek 
is executed in a rare public admission of a purge. Official media 
claimed Jang had been plotting to seize power. </p>
<p><span>September 2014</span>: Kim disappears from the public eye for 
weeks, prompting rumours of a palace coup, but the regime says he was in
 bad health. He was later seen in public with a cane. </p>
<p><span>July 2016</span>: The Obama administration imposes sanctions on Kim and other top officials, accusing them of human rights abuses. </p>
<p><span>September 2016</span>: North Korea conducts a major nuclear test, saying it has mastered the ability to mount a warhead on a ballistic missile. </p>
<p><span>February 2017</span>: Kim’s half-brother Kim Jong-nam is 
murdered with a nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur airport. The regime denies 
involvement despite widespread suspicion. </p>
<p><span>July 2017</span>: North Korea tests an inter-continental 
ballistic missile (ICBM) for the first time, saying the weapon can reach
 the continental United States. </p>
<p><span>March 2018</span>: Kim makes his first foreign trip as leader, with a surprise visit to Beijing to meet Xi Jinping. </p>
<p><span>June 2018</span>: Kim meets Donald Trump in Singapore, a 
landmark moment after months of angry rhetoric and exchanges of personal
 insults. The North Korean leader vows to work towards denuclearisation.</p>
<p><span>February 2019</span>: A second summit with Trump in Vietnam collapses in a stand-off over US sanctions relief. </p>
<p><span>June 2019</span>: Diplomatic hopes are briefly revived when 
Trump meets Kim again on an impromptu visit to the DMZ, but talks 
subsequently remain in stalemate. </p>
<p><span>April 2020</span>: Pyongyang insists it is not affected by the 
coronavirus pandemic, but Kim mysteriously misses his grandfather’s 
birthday celebrations amid fears over his health. </p>
<p>Kim was pictured presiding over the Workers’ Party politburo meeting 
on April 11. On April 12, the North’s official news state media KCNA 
reported that Kim had inspected drills by fighter jets at an air defence
 unit.</p>
<p>State media reported Kim sent greetings to Syrian President Bashar 
Assad last week and a ‘birthday spread’ to a North Korean woman who 
turned 100 on Monday, although he was not seen in public. </p>
<p>In 2014, Kim dropped out of sight for nearly six weeks before 
reappearing with a cane. Days later, the South’s spy agency said he had 
undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle.</p>
<p>‘No-one knows what’s going on inside North Korea,’ said Martyn Williams, who is affiliated with the 38 North research website.</p>
<p>‘Kim Jong Il had been dead several days before it was announced and it took everyone by surprise,’ he tweeted.</p>
<p>‘Kim Jong-un has been ‘missing’ before, and has always reappeared. That said, his absence this week was more notable.’ </p>
<p>But political analysts believe his conspicuous absence on Wednesday 
could point towards a political message Kim wants to send, that he wants
 to step away from the ‘cult of personality’ surrounding the ruling 
dynasty.</p>
<p>It also comes after a massive reshuffle of his inner circle on 
Saturday, in which a third of his leadership council were given their 
marching orders.</p>
<p>His sister, believed to be in her thirties, was also reinstated in 
her role as propaganda chief after being booted out over last year’s 
bungled talks with Donald Trump.</p>
<p>‘Kim Jong-Un wants to break away from the past, as well as the 
North’s traditional cult of personality,’ said Ahn Chan-il, a North 
Korean defector and researcher in Seoul.</p>
<p>‘His message is that Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung’s times are now over,’ he told AFP.</p>
<p>‘He wants to come across and brand himself as a leader who is modern 
and competent, rather than a descendant of his predecessors.</p>
<p>‘And he wants to gradually tone down the idolisation of the two late 
leaders as it goes against his agenda to brand the North as a ‘normal 
state’.’ </p>
<p>Neither Kim Jong-Un nor his sister Kim Yo Jong attended the 
celebration of their grandfather’s birth at the Kumsusan Palace of the 
Sun. Kim Yo Jong (left) walks ahead of her brother Kim Jong-Un (right) 
and South Korean President Moon Jae-in (center) in Pyongyang in 2018</p>
<p>Kim has been highly active in recent weeks and has been pictured out 
inspecting his military, sometimes with officers wearing face masks, 
while he does not</p>
<p>Alternatively, Kim may have been advised to stay away from public 
gatherings because of coronavirus, despite Pyongyang’s claims that it 
has zero cases of Covid-19. There have been major outbreaks in 
neighbouring South Korea and China. </p>
<p>Although his age does not put him in a high-risk category, it is 
feared that his heavy drinking, smoking and obesity would put the 
36-year-old at grave risk if he were to catch coronavirus. </p>
<p>Kim has been highly active in recent weeks and has been pictured out 
inspecting his military, sometimes with officers wearing face masks, 
while he does not. </p>
<p>Kim was a relative unknown to the West when he ascended to power replacing his father, Kim Jong-il.</p>
<p>His older half-brother Kim Jong-nam had once been seen as the likely 
successor, but fell out of favour and was later assassinated in Malaysia
 in 2017. </p>
<p>The ruling party’s claim to legitimacy has its roots in Kim Il Sung’s
 fight against Korea’s Japanese colonisers and for years the North’s 
official propaganda has promoted Kim Jong-Un’s resemblance to his 
grandfather, in appearance, manner, and even handwriting. </p>

<p>Under Kim, experts say research shows that North Korea has not 
stopped developing nuclear weapons despite ‘denuclearization’ talks with
 the US. North Korea’s state news agency released a photo of a 
super-large, multiple rocket launcher test in March</p>
<p>Under Kim, experts say research shows that North Korea has not 
stopped developing nuclear weapons despite ‘denuclearization’ talks with
 the US. </p>
<p>North Korea could have built up to 40 nuclear weapons by the end of 
2019 – a dozen more than Kim Jong-un had the same time the year before, 
researchers claim. </p>
<p>Donald Trump met Kim to discuss the possibility of giving up his 
nukes in Vietnam in February of last year, but talks stalled after North
 Korea demanded immediate relief from US sanctions in return for only 
partial steps toward disarmament.</p>
<p>By year’s end, Kim announced his country’s self-imposed moratorium on
 testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles was over.</p>
