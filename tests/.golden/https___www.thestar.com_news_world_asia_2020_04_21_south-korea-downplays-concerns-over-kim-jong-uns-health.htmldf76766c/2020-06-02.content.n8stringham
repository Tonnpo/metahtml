<h1 class="rm-manual">South Korea downplays concerns over Kim Jong Un’s health</h1>

<p>SEOUL, KOREA—South Korean officials reported no unusual activity in 
North Korea on Tuesday following unconfirmed media reports that leader 
Kim Jong Un was in fragile health after surgery.</p>
<p>But the possibility of high-level instability raised troubling 
questions about the future of a nuclear-armed state that has been 
steadily building an arsenal meant to threaten the U.S. mainland amid 
stalled talks between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>South Korea’s presidential office said Kim appeared to be handling 
state affairs as usual and that it had no information about rumours 
regarding his health. But many will be watching closely for any signs of
 trouble in North Korea, and whether it will address the reports — 
something it has not yet done.</p>
<p>The United States and North Korea appeared to be barrelling toward 
war in 2017, with the countries trading insults and threats of 
destruction. The next two years saw a surprising series of summits, 
including three between Kim and Trump, as Kim pursued diplomacy in hopes
 of ending crippling economic sanctions and obtaining security 
guarantees. But through it all he maintained his right to a nuclear 
arsenal, and most diplomacy has stalemated since.</p>
<p>Speculation often surfaces about North Korea’s leadership based on 
attendance at important state events. Kim, who is in his mid-30s, missed
 the celebration of the birthday of his late grandfather and state 
founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, the country’s most important holiday.</p>
<p>But he presided over a meeting on April 11, discussing <a href="https://www.thestar.com/coronavirus.html">coronavirus</a>
 prevention and electing his sister as an alternate member of the 
political bureau of the ruling Workers’ Party, according to the North’s 
official Korean Central News Agency. And state media have since reported
 he sent greetings to Syrian President Bashar Assad and Cuban President 
Miguel Diaz-Canel as well as arranging special birthday meals for two 
North Korean officials and a new centenarian.</p>
<p>“We have no information to confirm regarding rumours about Chairman 
Kim Jong Un’s health issue that have been reported by some media 
outlets,” South Korean presidential spokesman Kang Min-Seok said. “Also,
 no unusual developments have been detected inside North Korea.”</p>
<p>The presidential office later said Kim is believed to be staying at 
an unspecified location outside of Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, 
with some close confidants. It said Kim appeared to be normally engaged 
with state affairs and there wasn’t any unusual movement or emergency 
reaction from North Korea’s ruling party, military or Cabinet.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what would happen if Kim is sidelined by health problems
 or dies. Still less than a decade into Kim’s rule, North Korea has yet 
to give any meaningful indication of who would succeed him as leader.</p>
<p>Cheong Seong-Chang, an analyst at the private Sejong Institute in 
South Korea, said political upheaval would be unlikely as Kim’s sister, 
Kim Yo Jong, is already exercising significant influence within the 
government, and most members of North Korea’s leadership share an 
interest with the Kim family in maintaining the North’s system.</p>
<p>However, Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul’s Dongguk 
University and a policy adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, 
sees the possibility of a violent power struggle.</p>
<p>While Kim Yo Jong would most likely emerge as leader during a 
transitional period, other members of the top elite could try to reduce 
her to a figurehead while making important decisions from the shadows, 
Koh said.</p>
<p>North Korea has seen similar power struggles that ended with bloody 
purges during its seven decades of Kim family rule. Kim Jong Un’s 2013 
execution of his uncle and mentor, Jang Song Thaek, who was accused of 
treason and corruption, was seen as a major step in consolidating his 
rule.</p>
<p>Hong Min, a senior analyst at Seoul’s Korea Institute for National 
Unification, said North Korea once Kim is gone could be ruled by a 
collective leadership from the ruling party’s elite, similar to the 
post-Stalin Soviet Union. While it is perhaps too early to seriously 
contemplate Kim’s potential demise considering his age, his supposed 
heart and other health problems could become increasing factors in the 
years ahead, Hong said.</p>
<p>Robert O’Brien, the U.S. national security adviser, said the Trump 
administration is monitoring the reports about Kim’s health “very 
closely.” O’Brien said Tuesday during a television interview with Fox 
News Channel that North Korea is “parsimonious with the information they
 provide about many things, including the health of Kim Jong Un, so 
we’re monitoring these developments closely.”</p>
<p>A U.S. official said the White House was aware before the reports 
appeared late Monday that Kim’s health might be precarious. The official
 said the U.S. had information that Kim may have undergone surgery and 
that complications may have rendered him “incapacitated or worse.” But, 
the official stressed that the U.S. had nothing to confirm the surgery 
had taken place or that any complications had occurred.</p>
<p>The U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter 
publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, would not elaborate on 
where the information came from or when it had been received.</p>
<p>Conservative South Korean lawmaker Yoon Sang-Hyun, chairman of the 
National Assembly’s foreign affairs and unification committee, said he 
was told by unspecified non-government sources that Kim had surgery for 
cardiovascular problems. But an official from Seoul’s National 
Intelligence Service, who didn’t want to be named, citing office rules, 
said the spy agency couldn’t confirm whether Kim had surgery.</p>
<p>Kim In-Chul, spokesman for South Korea’s Foreign Ministry, said Seoul
 and Washington are maintaining close communication but didn’t provide a
 direct answer when asked whether the allies exchanged any meaningful 
intelligence about Kim’s health.</p>
<p>Outside governments and media have a mixed record on tracking 
developments among North Korea’s ruling elite, made difficult by the 
North’s stringent control of information about them.</p>

<p class="">In 2016, South Korean media quoted intelligence officials as
 saying Kim Jong Un had had a former military chief executed for 
corruption and other charges. But months later, North Korea’s state 
media showed Ri Yong Gil alive and serving in new senior posts.</p>
<p>Kim’s absence from state media often triggers speculation. In 2014, 
he vanished from the public eye for nearly six weeks before reappearing 
with a cane. South Korea’s spy agency said days later that he had a cyst
 removed from his ankle.</p>
<p>Kim took power upon his father’s death in December 2011 and is the third generation of his family to rule the country.</p>
