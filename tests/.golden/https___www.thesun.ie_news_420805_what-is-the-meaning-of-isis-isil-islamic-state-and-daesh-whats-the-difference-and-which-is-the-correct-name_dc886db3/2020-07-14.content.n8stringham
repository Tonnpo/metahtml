<p class="rm-manual">THE terrorist group is widely referred to Islamic State has slaughtered thousands and has inflicted terror across the globe.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The group is fighting for survival after 
humiliating military defeats and the debate continues over the official 
name of ISIS, Isil or Islamic State.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>5</span></p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"><span> There is much confusion surrounding the official name of the terror group</span><span>Credit: Getty Images</span></figcaption><h2>What does ISIS stand for?</h2>
<p>Many people have heard of the term ISIS, which is an acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>It can also mean the Islamic State in al-Sham, the Arabic name for 
the region, and the group have said its goal is to create a caliphate in
 this region.</p>
<p>The name ISIS has proved an issue for many companies and brands, as it also belongs to an ancient Egyptian goddess.</p>
<p>The murderous network – known for its barbaric public executions – 
was originally part of al-Qaeda before splitting with the group over 
differences in ideology and methods.</p>
<p>It believes all Muslims should unite into a worldwide caliphate.</p>
<p><span>5</span></p>

<p>Isil is an acronym standing for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.</p>
<p>This name was given to the group as it was thought to be more 
accurate to their geographical location as the Levant includes Syria, 
Palestine, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan.</p>
<p>Many governments and leaders, including Barack Obama and David 
Cameron, have used the term Isil as it is thought to be a better 
translation for al-Sham, which is the Arabic name for the area.</p>
<p>In a statement released following the brutal beheading of American 
photojournalist James Foley, Mr Cameron’s office said: “The Prime 
Minister has condemned the barbaric and brutal murder of James Foley by 
Isil (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in Syria.</p>
<p>“This will not change our commitment to tackling this appalling 
organisation and doing everything we can to keep our country safe.”</p>
<p><span>5</span></p>
<figcaption><span> ISIS militants parade in 2014 in Raqqa, Syria</span><span>Credit: Alamy</span></figcaption><h2>What is the meaning of Daesh?</h2>
<p>The word Daesh is an acronym for al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham.</p>
<p>The term is derived from a rough translation of Arabic words, 
including Arabic verb دعس, which means to tread underfoot or crush.</p>
<p>It can also be spelt DAIISH, Da'esh or Daech, and is a name which members of the terror group despise.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://blog.ap.org/announcements/now-we-say-the-islamic-state-group-instead-of-isil" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a> in 2014, ISIS threatened "to cut the tongue of anyone who publicly used the acronym Daesh".</p>
<p>Following the attacks in France, the French government started adopting this term instead of ISIS or Isil.</p>
<p>Former French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said: “This is a terrorist group and not a state.</p>
<p>“I do not recommend using the term Islamic State because it blurs the lines between Islam, Muslims and Islamists.”</p>
<p><span>5</span></p>

<p>The four competing names are just a few of the those used by the 
terror group, which started in 1999 when it was formed by Jordanian 
militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</p>
<p>As far as they are concerned, the correct term is the Islamic State -
 but the British and US Governments are among those preferring to use 
the name Isil.</p>
<p>The term ISIS is more commonly used within international news 
publications, and has been used as a label in official United Nations 
reports.</p>
<p>Counter-terrorism expert Dr Anne Aly, a research fellow at Curtin 
University, said it is neither "here or there" what you call the terror 
group.</p>
<p>She said it is more important to note that they call themselves the 
Islamic State, as it shows they are trying to create a state does not 
respect the borders of Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>In 2015 the BBC's Director General refused to drop the term Islamic State from the corporation's coverage.</p>
<p>All BBC broadcasts and reports refer to the group as the "so-called Islamic State".</p>
<p>At the time a BBC spokesman said the corporation had no choice but to refer to the group by the name it uses itself.</p>
