<p>PANICKING beer lovers cleared shop shelves in Mexico of crates of 
Corona after production was halted due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The bottled lager - whose sales have been hammered since the outbreak
 - will be put on ice after the government in Mexico deemed it a 
non-essential product.</p>

<figcaption><span> Stores across Mexico reported massive sales of the popular bottled lager</span><span>Credit: Newsflash/@valeriaturcios09</span></figcaption><p>It comes after the global coronavirus death toll passed 54,000 and number of infections reached the one-million mark.</p>
<p>Mexico has so far registered more than 1,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 50 deaths.</p>
<p>Non-essential activities have been suspended for at least the month of April to slow the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>News that production on Corona has been suspended sparked fears of a global shortage and sent beer fans flooding to stockists.</p>
<p>Pictures from Mexico showed shoppers loading trolleys with hundreds of crates in the wake of the shock announcement.</p>
<p>Grupo Modelo revealed on Thursday it will temporarily stop brewing 
Corona and other brands exported to 180 countries after its activities 
were declared non-essential under a government order aimed at curbing 
the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The brewery said it was scaling down its operations to a "bare 
minimum" in line with the Mexican government's orders but suggested it 
could keep brewing beer if its operations were deemed to be agriculture.</p>
<p>Agriculture and food production are among the key sectors which are still allowed to function under Mexican government orders.</p>
<p>The brewer said in a statement: "If the federal government considers 
it appropriate to issue some clarification confirming beer as an 
agro-industrial product, at Grupo Modelo we are ready to execute a plan 
with more than 75 per cent of our staff working from home and at the 
same time guaranteeing the supply of beer."</p>
<p>Grupo Modelo operates 11 breweries in Mexico and said the suspension will go into place from Sunday.</p>
<p>The brewery will reduce operations to a level where they could resume once the suspension is lifted</p>

<figcaption><span> Anheuser-Busch InBev, the brewer of Corona, has reported massive lost profits over the last few months</span><span>Credit: Newsflash/@valeriaturcios09</span></figcaption><p>Mexico's
 other major beer producer Heineken - which makes the Tecate and Dos 
Equis brands - could also stop activities on Friday, Mexican media said.</p>
<p>The northern state of Nuevo Leon where Heineken's Mexican operations 
are based said on Wednesday it would stop the distribution of beer, 
sparking panic-buying.</p>
<p>The company suffered another blow last week when plans for a 
$1.5billion brewery on the U.S. border were rejected in a referendum.</p>
<p>The plant was already two-thirds built but Mexico's government said it would not grant operating permits after the vote.</p>
<p>Anheuser-Busch InBev, the brewer of Corona and other beers, said last
 month it believes it has lost $170 million in profits due to the <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/coronavirus/" rel="">coronavirus</a> outbreak.</p>
<p>The massive lost sales over the last few months coincides with the rising concern over the disease.</p>
