<p class="rm-manual"> Newly declassified U.S. government documents shed 
light on some painful lessons from the Iranian Revolution in 
1979—lessons that the recent nuclear deal shows we have forgotten. </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> By <a href="https://www.thetrumpet.com/authors/2-joel-hilliker">Joel Hilliker</a> • June 13, 2016 </p>
<p><span>T</span>he Islamic Revolution of 1979 remains one of the most 
dramatic events in modern times—when the rule of Shah Mohammed Reza 
Pahlavi was replaced by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. This transformed an
 ally of the United States into a volcano of anti-Americanism. It turned
 Iran into an Islamic Republic—one of the most radical, violent regimes 
in the modern world—the source of tremendous unrest and terrorism 
throughout the Middle East and beyond. The revolution produced a 
belligerent foe that’s now on the cusp of getting nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>A trove of newly declassified U.S. government documents sheds some 
valuable light on the machinations and the forces behind that 
revolution.</p>
<p>This history has particular relevance today and is especially 
chilling to read in light of the recently concluded nuclear negotiations
 with Iran. It teaches valuable, painfully learned lessons that America 
has since forgotten.</p>
<h4>The Roots of Terrorism</h4>
<p>Trumpet editor in chief Gerald Flurry has often pointed to Iran as 
“the head of the terrorist snake.” In the January 2008 Trumpet magazine,
 he wrote:</p>
<p> We must go back in history to see <a href="file:///4493-pakistan-and-the-shah-of-iran">terrorism’s <span>deadly roots</span></a>
 and then deal with the cause of the problem. It’s not enough to destroy
 the branches of a vast network of world terrorism. We must pull up the 
terrorist tree by its roots. It’s the only way to win this war.When Shah
 Mohammed Reza Pahlavi led Iran, he was a strong ally of America. But 
our liberal press and politicians thought he was too undemocratic, so 
they helped to drive him from power. As he was falling, America gave him
 little or no support.Then, in 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini 
overthrew the shah. Khomeini established Iran as the world’s number one 
state sponsor of terrorism. </p>
<p>In that article, Mr. Flurry said it was only later, when that 
international network of terrorism intensified, that some observers 
began to see what a terrible mistake liberals had made in assisting the 
shah’s downfall.</p>
<p>The United States—specifically the administration of Jimmy Carter—has
 always insisted that it was firm in its support for the shah and his 
government. The story from Iran has always been that Khomeini 
courageously defied the United States, which he called “the Great 
Satan”—and that he conquered and vanquished Washington as it tried to 
keep the shah in power.</p>
<p>These newly declassified documents tell a much different story.</p>
<p>It’s true that the U.S. gave the shah “little or no support,” as Mr. 
Flurry wrote. In fact, as these documents reveal, the Carter 
administration was more hostile than it was merely negligent. 
Declassified diplomatic cables, policy memos and meeting records now 
show that the U.S. officials encouraged the shah to get out of 
Iran—while they were having secret discussions with Khomeini that helped
 usher him into power!</p>
<p>In report titled “<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36431160">Two Weeks in January: America’s Secret Engagement With Khomeini</a>,” the <span>bbc</span> Persian Service wrote on June 3:</p>
<p> [T]he documents reveal that Khomeini was far more engaged with the 
U.S. than either government has ever admitted. Far from defying America,
 the ayatollah courted the Carter administration, sending quiet signals 
that he wanted a dialogue and then portraying a potential Islamic 
Republic as amenable to U.S. interests. </p>
<p>Khomeini fed U.S. officials a banquet of lies, and they ate it up!</p>
<h4>Iran in Turmoil </h4>
<p>Back in 1977, Iran was in disarray. There were frequent protests 
against the shah, and in the latter part of 1978, massive strikes and 
demonstrations were paralyzing Iran. The <span>bbc</span> report continued:</p>
<p> On Nov. 9, 1978, in a now-famous cable, “Thinking the Unthinkable,” 
the U.S. ambassador to Iran, William Sullivan, warned that the shah was 
doomed. He argued that Washington should get the shah and his top 
generals out of Iran, and then make a deal between junior commanders and
 Khomeini. </p>
<p>President Carter didn’t agree at the time, “but by early January 
[1979], the reluctant president concluded that the shah’s departure was 
necessary to calm the opposition.”</p>
<p>But “the situation became explosive after the shah’s new prime 
minister, Shapour Bakhtiar, deployed troops and tanks to close the 
airport, disrupting Khomeini’s planned return in late January,” wrote 
the <span>bbc</span>.</p>
<p><span>It seemed Iran was on the brink of a civil war</span>: The 
elite Imperial Guard divisions were ready to fight to the death for 
their king [the shah]; the die-hard followers of the imam [Khomeini’s 
supporters] were ready for armed struggle and martyrdom.The White House 
feared an Iranian civil war that would have major implications for U.S. 
strategic interests. At stake were the lives of thousands of U.S. 
military advisers; the security of sophisticated American weapons 
systems in Iran, such as F-14 jets; a vital flow of oil; and the future 
of the most important institution of power in Iran, the military.<span>It was less alarmed by the rise of Khomeini and the downfall of the shah</span> [emphasis added throughout]. </p>
<p>What a terrible miscalculation.</p>
<p>U.S. officials were strongly backing Prime Minister Bakhtiar in 
public—but these documents show that they didn’t have any real 
confidence in him and were exploring the possibility of his being ousted
 in a coup.</p>
<p>On Jan. 9, 1979, the deputy national security adviser, David Aaron, 
wrote this to his boss, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter’s national security 
adviser: “The best that can result, in my view, is a military coup 
against Bakhtiar and then <span>a deal struck between the military and Khomeini that finally pushes the shah out of power</span>.”</p>
<p>Just two days later, President Carter pressed the shah to “leave 
promptly.” That is worse than just giving him “little or no support”—the
 U.S. actively pushed for him to flee his country in order to create a 
power vacancy there.</p>
<p>The report said, “By then, a broad consensus had emerged within the 
U.S. national security bureaucracy that they could do business with the 
ayatollah and his inner circle after all.”</p>
<p>How dangerously wrong a “broad consensus” can be! These officials 
completely misread the situation, and they talked themselves into 
thinking the ayatollah could be trusted. They placed real confidence in 
their relationship with Khomeini’s second-in-command, Mohammad Beheshti,
 an English-speaking cleric who had lived in the West, whom they 
considered a pragmatic man who could be reasoned with.</p>
<p>We have seen a similar disastrous scenario play out in recent years 
with the current Iranian ayatollah and the “moderate” Iranian President 
Hassan Rouhani.</p>
<p>The report continued:</p>
<p> The Carter administration began secret talks with Khomeini with the 
primary objective of making an elusive deal between the ayatollah and 
the military. It’s also possible that they wanted to slow down 
Khomeini’s momentum or read his intentions. But they ended up achieving 
none of those goals.Khomeini wanted a decisive victory, not a deal. But a
 tactical engagement with Washington suited him well. </p>
<p>The same script could be written for the nuclear negotiations. 
Confident Americans enter these discussions with many lofty goals, 
basing the entire effort on false assumptions and misplaced faith—and 
come away empty-handed. Canny Iranians find that “tactical engagement 
with Washington” suits them well, especially considering how easy it is 
to deceive them!</p>
<p>Ultimately, the ayatollah wanted to know whether the Iranian military
 leaders—who were allied with America and met with them daily—were 
willing to turn their back on the shah’s regime. He wanted to make sure 
they wouldn’t interfere when he came to power, and that the U.S. 
wouldn’t step in at the last minute to undermine him.</p>
<p>The Americans allayed Khomeini’s concerns completely. America’s 
official statement was: “If the integrity of the army can be preserved, 
we believe there is every prospect the leadership will support whatever 
political form is selected for Iran in the future.”</p>
<p>This was all the assurance Ayatollah Khomeini needed. It was a green light to proceed with the revolution.</p>
<p>Khomeini responded to American officials with a beautifully crafted package of lies.</p>
<p>He pledged to preserve the Iranian military. He promised that Iran 
would be friendly to America at best or neutral at worst. He said 
Iranian oil would continue flowing to the West. He spoke of future 
expanded economic engagement with the U.S., implying that Iran would be 
more interested in buying tractors than tanks. He said he would respect 
his neighbors, following a policy of “non-interference in other people’s
 affairs.” He said that Soviet influence in Iran was dead: “The Russian 
government is atheistic and anti-religion,” a spokesman for Khomeini 
explained to American officials. “We will definitely find it more 
difficult to have a deep understanding with the Russians. … You are 
Christians and believe in God, and they don’t. We feel it easier to be 
closer to you than to Russians.”</p>
<p>The <span>bbc</span> wrote:</p>
<p> In a first-person message, Khomeini told the White House not to 
panic at the prospect of losing a strategic ally of 37 years and assured
 them that he, too, would be a friend.”You will see we are not in any 
particular animosity with the Americans,” said Khomeini, pledging his 
Islamic Republic will be “a humanitarian one, which will benefit the 
cause of peace and tranquility for all mankind.” </p>
<p>Clearly, Khomeini read the Americans well. He knew just what they 
wanted to hear, to the detail. He gave it to them like a skilled con 
artist, lying through the smile on his face.</p>
<p>Reading that list of promises and assurances in light of the 
nightmares brought on by the Iranian Revolution makes you shake your 
head that anyone would have ever believed it. The fact of its being rank
 deceit would start to become plain within just a few weeks, and one of 
the ayatollah’s first actions after returning to Iran was to begin 
executing top military officials. Within a year, the American Embassy in
 Tehran was besieged, and the anti-American fangs of the revolution were
 fully bared.</p>
<p>The <span>bbc</span> report concluded:</p>
<p> Many have come to believe that that the Carter 
administration—plagued by intelligence failures and internal 
division—was by and large a passive observer to the rapid demise of the 
shah.But it’s now clear that, in the final stages of the crisis, America
 had in effect hedged its bet by keeping a firm foot in both camps in 
the hopes of a soft landing after the fall of the shah’s regime.But 
Carter’s gambit proved to be a massive blunder. The real danger was 
overlooked, Khomeini’s ambitions were underestimated, and his moves were
 misread.Unlike Carter, Khomeini pursued a consistent strategy and 
played his hand masterfully. Guided by a clear vision of establishing an
 Islamic republic, the ayatollah engaged America with empty promises, 
understood its intentions, and marched toward victory. </p>
<p>This history teaches a bitter moral truth about just how 
catastrophically wrong human judgment can be. The role America played in
 bringing one of its most virulent enemies to power is stunning to 
contemplate. As is so often the case, however, these lessons of history 
are being ignored—and to our shame and peril. The current American 
administration has no interest in the stinging wisdom of these past 
events, and—judging by its recent actions—likely wouldn’t even consider 
Carter’s secret dialogue with Khomeini a mistake.</p>
<p>But a disastrous mistake it was. The effects of that appalling 
misjudgment in 1979, that naive stupidity, helped to reshape the Middle 
East into a deadlier, more radical place, and caused untold suffering. 
The effects of the Islamic Revolution continue to shake the world to 
this day.</p>
<p>An appreciation of these facts would lead prudent leaders to look 
askance at any promises from the radicals in Tehran today and to vow, 
“Never again.”</p>
<p>But America’s leaders today are not prudent. They are heedlessly 
taking the same course, and the consequences are certain to prove even 
more dangerous when the day dawns on a nuclear-armed Iran.</p>
<p>In his January 2008 article, Mr. Flurry explained: “Here is the brutal truth: <span>There would be no state-sponsored terrorism in the Middle East if America had the will to use its power</span>!
 But America’s problem is even worse than a weak will. We even help push
 our allies into the hands of radical Islam. That is a dangerous kind of
 ignorance. … America has a much deeper problem than any of our leaders 
really see. The root of our problem is spiritual.”</p>
