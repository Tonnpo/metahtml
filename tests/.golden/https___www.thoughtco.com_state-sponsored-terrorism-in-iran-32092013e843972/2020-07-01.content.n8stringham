<h2> <span> Iran has consistently been described by the United States as
 the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism. It actively supports 
terrorist groups, most prominently the Lebanese group Hezbollah. The 
Iranian relationship with Hezbollah demonstrates one accepted 
explanation of why states sponsor terrorism: to indirectly influence 
politics elsewhere. </span> </h2>
<p>According to Michael Scheuer, the former CIA officer:</p>
<blockquote>State-sponsored terrorism came in the middle-1970s, and ... 
its heyday was in the 1980s and early-'90s. And typically, the 
definition of a state sponsor of terrorism is a country that uses 
surrogates as its weapon to attack other people. The primary example to 
this day is Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. Hezbollah, in the nomenclature 
of the discussion, would be the surrogate of Iran.</blockquote>

<h2> <span> Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps </span> </h2>
<p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was created following 
the 1979 revolution to protect and promote the objectives of the 
revolution. As a foreign force, they have also exported that revolution,
 by training Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, and other groups. There is 
evidence that that IRGC is playing an active role to undermine Iraq, by 
funneling funds and arms to Shiite militias, engaging directly in 
military activity and gathering intelligence. The extent of Iranian 
involvement is not clear.​</p>
<p>Iran and Hezbollah</p>
<p>Hezbollah (which means Party of God, in Arabic), an Islamist Shiite 
militia based in Lebanon, is a direct product of Iran. It was formally 
established in 1982 following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, aimed at 
uprooting the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization) bases there. 
Iran sent Revolutionary Guard Corps members to assist in the war. A 
generation later, the relationship between Iran and Hezbollah is not 
entirely transparent, so it is not clear whether Hezbollah should be 
considered a full proxy for Iranian intentions. However, Iran funds, 
arms, and trains Hezbollah, in large part through the IRGC.</p>
<p>According to the New York Sun, Iranian Revolutionary Guard soldiers 
fought alongside Hezbollah in the Israel-Hezbollah summer 2006 war by 
supplying intelligence on Israeli targets and manning and firing 
missiles.</p>

<h2> <span> Iran and Hamas </span> </h2>
<p>Iran's relationship with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas has not
 been constant over time. It has, rather, waxed and waned according to 
the interests of Iran and Hamas at different times since the late 1980s.
 Hamas is the dominant political party in the Palestinian territories 
that has long relied on terrorist tactics, including suicide bombing, to
 register a protest against Israeli policies.</p>
<p>According to Cambridge University Professor George Joffe, Iran's 
relationship with Hamas began in the 1990s; it was around this time that
 Iran's interest in exporting revolution coincided with Hamas' rejection
 of compromise with Israel. Iran has been alleged to provide funding and
 training for Hamas since the 1990s, but the extent of either is 
unknown. However, Iran did pledge to help fund the Hamas-led Palestinian
 government after its parliamentary win in January 2006.</p>

<h2> <span> Iran and Palestinian Islamic Jihad </span> </h2>
<p>The Iranians and PIJ first made extended contact in the late 1980s in
 Lebanon. Subsequently, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps trained PIJ 
members at Hezbollah camps in Lebanon and Iran commenced funding PIJ.​​</p>
<p>Iran and Nuclear Weapons</p>
<p>The creation of WMD is not itself a criterion for being a state 
sponsor of terrorism, however, when already designated state sponsors to
 appear to have manufacturing or acquisition capabilities, the U.S. 
grows especially worried because could be transferred to terrorist 
groups. At the end of 2006, the United Nations adopted Resolution 1737 
and imposed sanctions on Iran for failing to halt its uranium 
enrichment. Iran has contended that it has that right, in order to 
create a civil nuclear program</p>
