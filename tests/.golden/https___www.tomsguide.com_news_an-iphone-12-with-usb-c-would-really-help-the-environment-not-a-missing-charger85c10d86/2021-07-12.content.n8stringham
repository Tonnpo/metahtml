<h1 class="rm-manual">An iPhone 12 with USB-C would really help the environment — not a missing charger</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"> By <span><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/author/imad-khan" rel="author"><span>Imad Khan</span></a></span> 18 October 2020 </p>
<p>A good step forward, but Apple could do more</p>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"> <span>(Image credit: Apple)</span> </figcaption><p>During
 last week’s Apple’s iPhone 12 event, the Cupertino-based company was 
proud to tout its environmental initiatives. Its offices, data centers 
and stores currently run on 100% renewable energy and the company is 
aiming for net zero “climate impact” by 2030. </p>
<p>Apple’s environmentally conscious redesign has extended beyond 
corporate offices and malls. This year’s iPhones will not ship with 
earbuds or a charger, all in the name of lowering needless waste. This 
allows 70% more iPhones to be shipped on pallets and, according to Lisa 
Jackson, VP of environment, policy and social initiatives at Apple, 
“it’s like removing 450,000 cars from the road per year.” </p>

<p>“This could not only help to reduce waste but also would prevent 
upstream environmental impacts linked to the extraction of primary raw 
materials, manufacturing and distribution of products,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/apple-praised-for-removing-earpods-and-charger-from-iphone-12-box.html">said</a>
 Dr. Teresa Domenech, a lecturer in industrial ecology at the University
 College London’s Institute for Sustainable Resources, to CNBC.</p>
<p>Even then, there’s a dissonance in Apple’s newly public ecological 
approach. For all the good the company is purporting to do, there’s one 
dogged design quirk that continues to remain, flying in the face of its 
corporate activism. Apple is still sticking with its proprietary 
Lightning charge port. If the company really did care about the 
environment, it would have switched to USB Type-C. </p>
<h2>The iPhone 12’s hidden costs </h2>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"><span>(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption><p>According
 to Apple, there are currently 2 billion iPhone charging adapters out in
 the world, and that’s not including third-party ones. Many of these 
adapters use the standard rectangular USB Type-A port. But included with
 the iPhone 12 will be a USB Type-C to Lightning cable, making old 
adapters incompatible.</p>
<p>Across Apple stores later this month, sales reps will likely ask 
shoppers if they have a charge adapter that’s USB Type-C compatible. 
Some might, many won’t. Of course, these users could use their old 5W 
adapters and Type-A to lightning cables as well. But the new iPhone has 
fast charging, and for $19, users can upgrade to the latest charge 
adapters for speedy electrical fuel up. This curtails some of those 
environmental benefits.</p>
<p>At this moment, most of the tech world has moved on to USB Type-C. 
All Android phones are currently on the standard and have been so for 
years. Even the latest iPads and Macbooks currently use Type-C, so it’s 
not as if the connection standard is foreign to Apple. It leaves the 
iPhone as the rogue outlier, stubbornly sticking to outdated electrical 
pins as a means to keep iPhone users tied to a proprietary port. </p>
<p>If Apple had switched to Type-C, it could have allowed the existing 
ecosystem of cables and adapters to be folded into the iPhone 12. Users 
with the new iPad or MacBook could roll over their existing charging 
accessories to keep iPhone 12s charged. Android users jumping to iPhone 
could have continued to use the charging adapters included with their 
old phones. Or anyone who knows someone with an Android device could 
have piggybacked off their existing power setup. </p>
<p>Given the potential waste-saving advantages, Apple’s decision to 
stick to Lightning is all the more baffling. And let’s not forget that 
Apple will still need to ship tiny Type-C power adapters across the 
world to accommodate the new cable included with the iPhone 12. While 
these new adapters will have a long shelf life, it will cut back on the 
emissions savings that Apple so proudly publicizes. </p>
<h2>Why Apple won’t kill the Lightning port </h2>
<figcaption class="rm-manual"><span>(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption><p>So, why has Apple chosen not to adopt Type-C for iPhone when the waste-saving advantages are seemingly obvious?</p>
<p>It likely comes down to profit. It’s hard to say exactly why 
Lightning remains, especially when Apple has already switched over to 
USB-C on iPad and Macbook, but one can surmise that with iPhone being 
Apple’s most popular product category, downstream accessory sales tied 
to lightning are powerful.</p>
<p>Cables and charging adapters are cheap to make. While Apple hasn’t 
revealed manufacturing costs, generally charger production at high scale
 is only a couple of cents. So, even assuming the production, boxing, 
and shipping of adapters and cables comes out to a dollar, with a price 
tag of $19 a piece, it’s easy money. </p>
<p>At the moment, Apple <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/28/apple-wearables-home-and-accessories-segment-now-bigger-than-mac.html">reports</a>
 sales of cables and chargers along with other accessories like Airpods 
and the Apple Watch. This segment of Apple’s business accounts for $10 
billion in quarterly revenue. It’s outperforming the Mac line by almost 
$3 billion. The financial incentive to switch to USB Type-C for iPhone 
12 could rob Apple of the overwhelming gains from accessory sales. </p>
<h2> Outlook </h2>
<p>Overall, Apple’s move to not include a charge adapter with this 
year’s phone is good for the environment. Apple is often a trend setter,
 with the rest of the tech world following suit. Don’t be surprised if 
Samsung, LG, and others start removing accessories and making boxes 
slimmer (though probably not right away in <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s21-will-have-the-iphone-12s-biggest-missing-feature">Samsung’s case</a>). And of course, not having to include accessories will also increase profit margins. </p>
<p>But don’t assume that Apple is being altruistic about any of this. If
 it were, it would have killed Lightning years ago, instead of clinging 
to it with a death grip to keep iPhone users from buying elsewhere.</p>

 What's really bad for the environment is when people create ewaste by

to USB C, and included a USB C to USB A cable in the box, it would be 
compatible with all those older USB A charging bricks most phones have 
come with in the past, and make it convenient when people inevitably buy
 USB C accessories over time as all other devices will have. The only 
excess waste would be those buying lightning to USB C adapters that they
 would no doubt come out alongside the move, and is probably going to be
 about the same excess spending as those that now have to buy USB C 
chargers or USB A to lightning cables as the old ones are degraded but 
the charging bricks still work. </p><p class="rm-manual"> Instead they 
have only increased the need for people to buy lightning accessories, 
when chances are a usb c accessory would be much easier to come by(and 
not needed to be produced in two versions), and there will still be a
