<h2 class="rm-manual">Decoding Iran’s politics: the formation of the Quds Force</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">Gen. Qassem Soleimani (C), who heads the elite Quds

group of the guard’s officers in Tehran, June 30, 2018. (AP)</p>
<p class="rm-manual">By H Rastgoo</p>
<p class="rm-manual">January 8, 2019</p>
<p>According to Iran’s constitution, the main mission of the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) is “to safeguard the Islamic 
Revolution of Iran and its achievements.” The Revolutionary Corps’ 
charter emphasizes “cooperation between the Revolutionary Guards and the
 Artesh [Iran’s regular army] when necessary in order to protect the 
country’s independence and territorial integrity.” However, the main 
task of the Revolutionary Guards is not the protection of Iran’s 
borders. It is to protect the Islamic Revolution, which, in the Islamic 
Republic’s political lexicon, has a meaning that goes beyond the 
geographical boundaries of Iran.</p>
<p>In light of the global mission that was defined for the Revolutionary
 Guards, in March 1981, two years after the establishment of the Islamic
 Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Liberation Movements Unit of the 
Revolutionary Guards began its activities. In June 1981, a group of 
representatives of Middle Eastern and North African Islamist groups 
traveled to Tehran to take part in a conference hosted by the Liberation
 Movements Unit. As part of a final resolution reached during the 
conference, the group demanded “the formation of a Quds Force by the 
Islamic Republic” in order to “liberate Quds” — meaning the 
Palestinians.</p>
<p>The Official Formation of the Quds Force</p>
<p>The formation of the Quds Force in Iran was anti-Israeli in nature 
and focused on helping forces that were actively and overtly 
anti-Israel. Nevertheless, the idea of “exporting the revolution” and 
the desire to support all pro-Iran Islamist — mainly Shia — groups, 
which the Islamic Republic described as “liberation movements,” resulted
 in the Revolutionary Guards’ support for not only Palestinian and 
Lebanese groups, but also for certain paramilitary forces in other 
countries in the region.</p>
<p>In 1985, on the order of Ayatollah Khomeini, the non-military duties 
of the Liberation Movement Unit of the Revolutionary Guards were 
assigned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle Tehran’s relations
 with affiliated groups in various countries. At the same time, all of 
the military duties of the former Liberation Movement Unit were 
transferred to the Quds Force.</p>
<p>At first, the main task of the Quds Force was to confront the Iraqi 
army during the war. In order to do so, Iran aimed to use the potential 
of Saddam’s opponents in the Kurdish and Shia regions of Iraq. Over this
 period, Shia opponents, using Iranian financial and logistic support, 
formed the Badr Army, which included two branches, namely the Ahrar 
(consisting of Iraqi collaborator prisoners) and the Mojahedin 
(including the mainly Shia members of opposition). The Badr Army had 
very close organizational and operational ties with the Quds Force.</p>
<p>The Quds Force after the Iran-Iraq War</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Iran-Iraq War, the Quds Force developed its 
activities in different countries. For instance, the force supported the
 troops of Ahmad Shah Masoud in Afghanistan against the Soviet army and 
later against the Taliban. The Quds Force was also active in Eastern 
Europe in 1992 during the Bosnia conflict, providing weapons as well as 
training and military advice to local Muslim forces against the Serbian 
military and paramilitary troops. In the same period, the Quds Force 
supported the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, headed by Jalal Talabani, in
 internal conflicts in Iraqi Kurdistan, which strengthened the position 
of this Iran-related group in northern Iraq. The Quds Force supported — 
and continue to support — Palestinian militant groups such as the 
Islamic Jihad and Hamas, too.</p>
<p>In addition to these activities, the Quds Force intensified its 
activities to support the Lebanese Hezbollah to make this group the most
 powerful military force in Lebanon. This support paved the way for 
Hezbollah’s success in forcing the Israeli army to evacuate Lebanon in 
May 2000. The Quds Force’s support for this Lebanese group has continued
 unconditionally since then.</p>
<p>With the extension of the Quds Force’s operations, it was recognized 
as a determining power in in the Middle East. This development also 
increased the group’s influence within the Iranian establishment and 
transformed it into a key factor in the Islamic Republic’s regional 
diplomacy. In this regard, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the late chairman 
of Iran’s Discernment Expediency Council and the acting 
commander-in-chief of the Iranian armed forces during the Iran-Iraq War,
 said in 2016: “The foreign ministry has been deprived of carrying out 
its responsibilities in the most sensitive areas that concern us. In 
Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Yemen, etc, no one can send an 
ambassador without the approval of the Quds Force.”</p>
<p>The Quds Force has been accused of organizing terrorist activities 
outside Iran. These accusations refer to a set of assassinations since 
the end of the Iran-Iraq War, ranging from the terror of certain deaths 
of Iraqi jet fighters after the war to the murder of the political 
opponents of the Islamic Republic in Europe and even the bombing of the 
Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) in Buenos Aires. Many of 
these operations have been allegedly carried out by the Quds Force’s 
associates, including Lebanese and Palestinian operatives.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last decade, the Quds Force has organized 
militant groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, supported the Bahraini 
opposition, and provided support for certain armed groups in Pakistan 
and Afghanistan. The Iranian administration has not been involved in 
decision-making for the Quds Force’s activities, but has supplied the 
budget needed for such activities.</p>
<p>After the occupation of Iraq by US troops, the Quds Force helped 
anti-US guerrilla forces against the Americans, leading to heavy 
casualties.</p>
<p>After ISIS’s invasion of northern Iraq in 2014, the Quds Force 
escalated its operations in the country through organizing and arming 
Shia forces and providing them with advice. This involvement played a 
decisive role in ISIS’s defeat in Iraq and strengthened Iran’s position 
in that country.</p>
<p>The Quds Force played a similar role in Syria’s civil war from 2012 
on, and managed to effectively help the Syrian government to overcome 
its armed opponents and regain control of its territory.</p>
<p>The Structure of the Quds Force</p>
<p>The Quds Force is one of the four forces of the Islamic Revolutionary
 Guards Corps. The three other forces of the Revolutionary Guards are 
the Ground Force, the Navy, and the Aerospace (Missile) Force.</p>
<p>The commander of the Quds Force is proposed by the commander-in-chief
 of the Revolutionary Guards and appointed by Ayatollah Khamenei. Until 
1997, Ahmed Vahidi was the Quds Force commander. Since then, Ghasem 
Soleimani has been the commander of the force.</p>
<p>In addition to the appointment of the commander of the Quds Force, 
the Supreme Leader also appoints a representative to the force. The 
Leader’s current representative the Quds Force is a cleric named Ali 
Shirazi.</p>
<p>Although the exact number of Quds Force personnel is not clear, 
informed sources in Iran assert that there are not more than 10,000 
troops in this elite force. But various sources have published 
exaggerated reports about the number of Quds Force personnel, some even 
estimating this number to be up to 50,000.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that even at the height of the Iran-Iraq 
War, the number of Revolutionary Guards troops never exceeded 250,000, 
and the current number of Revolutionary Guards troops, including its 
very large ground force, is certainly less than 200,000. As a result, it
 is inconceivable that up to a quarter of the entire Revolutionary 
Guards staff could be Quds Force members.</p>
