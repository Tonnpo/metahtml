<p class="rm-manual"> · November 29, 1999 · </p>
<p>Just breathing out — without coughing or sneezing — is enough for a 
person with the flu to spread the virus, according to new research led 
by the University of Maryland in College Park. “People with flu,” 
explains senior author Donald K. Milton, professor of environmental 
health at the University of Maryland, “generate infectious aerosols 
(tiny droplets that stay suspended in the air for a long time) even when
 they are not coughing, and especially during the first days of 
illness.” The common belief is that flu is spread through coughs and 
sneezes from infected individuals and from touching surfaces 
contaminated with the virus. However, the new study reveals that people 
with the flu can shed the infectious virus into the air around them just
 by breathing. “So,” Prof. Milton urges, “when someone is coming down 
with influenza, they should go home and not remain in the workplace and 
infect others.” He and his colleagues report their findings in the 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Flu, or influenza, is 
an infectious respiratory disease that is caused by viruses. The illness
 ranges from mild to severe and can lead to hospitalization and even 
death. People at higher risk of… <a href="file:///go?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkaWNhbG5ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzIwNjkwLnBocA==" rel="nofollow">Read full this story</a></p>
