 described in the Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations, the 
sanctionable activities of a foreign financial institution are: </p> <ul>
<li><p>Facilitating the efforts of the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=886e9a4661c69615cd12ec3ed697d807&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1321&amp;rgn=div8">Government of Iran </a>(GOI)
 to acquire or develop Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) or delivery 
systems for WMD or to provide support for terrorist organizations or 
acts of international terrorism;</p></li> <li><p>Facilitating the activities of a person subject to financial sanctions pursuant to UNSCRs <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/1737.pdf">1737</a>, <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/1747.pdf">1747</a>, <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/1803.pdf">1803</a>, or <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/1929.pdf">1929</a>, or any other Security Council resolution that imposes sanctions with respect to Iran;</p></li> <li><p>Engaging in money laundering, or facilitating efforts by the Central Bank of Iran or any other <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d6b227d293738d9667369e986e3fcd9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1320&amp;rgn=div8">Iranian financial institution</a>, to carry out either of the facilitating activities described above; or</p></li> <li><p>Facilitating
 a significant transaction or transactions or providing significant 
financial services for: (i) the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or any
 of its agents or affiliates whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act</a>
 (IEEPA), or (ii) a financial institution whose property and interests 
in property are blocked pursuant to IEEPA in connection with Iran’s 
proliferation of WMD, Iran’s proliferation of delivery systems for WMD, 
or Iran’s support for international terrorism.</p></li>
</ul> <p>150. Where can I find a list of Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
Corps (IRGC) affiliates and Iran-linked financial institutions “blocked 
pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)”?</p> <p>The
 list of blocked IRGC affiliates and blocked Iran-linked financial 
institutions is dynamic and is based on the identity of “designated” 
persons, which refers both to natural persons (i.e., individuals) and 
legal persons (such as corporations and other entities). The most recent
 list of designated persons – which includes most, but not all, blocked 
entities* – can be found at <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx">www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx</a>.
 The listings of designated IRGC entities will be followed by the tag 
[IRGC]; those of designated Iran-linked financial institutions will have
 the tag [IFSR].</p> <p>*Under Department of the Treasury regulations, 
designated persons are those that are named on the list. All interests 
in property of such persons are blocked, and such persons are considered
 to have an interest in all property and entities in which they own, 
directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest. As a result, 
such property and entities are also blocked, even if they do not 
themselves appear on the list.</p> <p>151. How do the Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations (IFSR) define “U.S. financial institutions”?</p> <p>The<a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9874a1de71122f946a56d27417c6c372&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr561_main_02.tpl"> Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations </a>(IFSR) define <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d6b227d293738d9667369e986e3fcd9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1309&amp;rgn=div8">“U.S. financial institutions”</a>
 to include: depository institutions, banks, savings banks, money 
service businesses, trust companies, insurance companies, securities 
brokers and dealers, commodities exchanges, clearing corporations, 
investment companies, employee benefit plans, and U.S. holding 
companies, U.S. affiliates, or U.S. subsidiaries of any of these 
entities. Covered institutions include those branches, offices, and 
agencies of foreign financial institutions that are located in the 
United States.</p> <p>152. How do the Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations (IFSR) define “foreign financial institutions”?</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9874a1de71122f946a56d27417c6c372&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr561_main_02.tpl">Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations</a> (IFSR) define “<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1308&amp;rgn=div8">foreign financial institutions</a>”
 to include foreign depository institutions, banks, savings banks, money
 service businesses, trust companies, securities brokers and dealers, 
commodities exchanges, clearing corporations, investment companies, 
employee benefit plans, and holding companies, affiliates, or 
subsidiaries of any of these entities.</p> <p>153. How do the Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations (IFSR) define the term “knowingly”?</p> <p>The term “<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1314&amp;rgn=div8">knowingly</a>” as used in the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9874a1de71122f946a56d27417c6c372&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr561_main_02.tpl">IFSR</a>
 means that a person has actual knowledge or should have known of 
specific conduct, a circumstance, or a result. In other words, the IFSR 
could be implicated if the Treasury Department finds that a <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1308&amp;rgn=div8">foreign financial institution</a> knew or should have known that it engaged in one or more of the sanctionable activities.</p> <p>154.
 How does the Treasury Department determine whether a transaction or 
financial service is “significant” for purposes of the Iranian Financial
 Sanctions Regulations (IFSR)?</p> <p>As set out in the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9874a1de71122f946a56d27417c6c372&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr561_main_02.tpl">IFSR</a>, in determining whether a transaction or financial service is “<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1404&amp;rgn=div8">significant</a>,”
 the Treasury Department may consider: (1) the size, number, frequency, 
and nature of the transaction(s); (2) the level of awareness of 
management of the transaction(s) and whether or not the transaction(s) 
are a part of a pattern of conduct; (3) the nexus between the foreign 
financial institution involved in the transaction(s) and a blocked 
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps individual or entity or blocked 
Iran-linked financial institution; (4) the impact of the transaction(s) 
on the goals of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and 
Divestment Act <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr2194.pdf">(CISADA)</a>;
 (5) whether the transaction(s) involved any deceptive practices; and 
(6) other factors the Treasury Department deems relevant on a 
case-by-case basis.</p> <p>155. When are the prohibitions and strict 
conditions on foreign financial institutions’ correspondent accounts or 
payable-through accounts in the United States effective?</p> <p>A finding by the Treasury Department that a <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1308&amp;rgn=div8">foreign financial institution </a>knowingly
 engages in one or more of the sanctionable activities is necessary 
before the Treasury Department can prohibit or impose strict conditions 
on the opening or maintaining in the United States of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1306&amp;rgn=div8">correspondent accounts </a>or <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1307&amp;rgn=div8">payable-through accounts </a>for that foreign financial institution.</p> <p>156. How will U.S. and foreign financial institutions know that the Treasury Department has made such a finding?</p> <p>As
 a general matter, the Treasury Department will reach out to foreign 
financial institutions to inquire about their conduct before making a 
finding. If the Treasury Department decides to impose strict 
condition(s), the Treasury Department will issue an order or a 
regulation that sets out the strict condition(s) to be imposed on the 
U.S. <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1306&amp;rgn=div8">correspondent accounts </a>or U.S. <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1307&amp;rgn=div8">payable-through accounts </a>of
 the relevant foreign financial institution and publish the order or 
regulation in the Federal Register. The Federal Register is available at
 www.gpo.gov/fdsys/. If the Treasury Department decides to prohibit the 
opening or maintaining of U.S. correspondent accounts or U.S. 
payable-through accounts for a foreign financial institution, the 
Treasury Department will add the name of the foreign financial 
institution and publish it to the <a href="file:///ofac/downloads/561list.pdf">part 561 list</a>.</p> <p>157. How will the Treasury Department enforce the Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations (IFSR) with respect to U.S. entities?</p> <p>Any U.S. person who violates the correspondent account provisions of the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9874a1de71122f946a56d27417c6c372&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr561_main_02.tpl">IFSR</a>
 may be subject to civil penalties of up to the greater of $250,000 or 
twice the transaction value, and criminal penalties for willful 
violations of up to $1 million and 20 years in prison. A U.S. financial 
institution may be subject to civil penalties of up to the greater of 
$250,000 or twice the transaction value, if any person that it owns or 
controls violates the IFSR prohibition on engaging in any transaction 
with or benefitting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) or any 
of its agents or affiliates whose property and interests in property are
 blocked pursuant to the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act</a> (IEEPA), and if the U.S. financial institution knew or should have known that the person violated the IFSR.</p> <p>158.
 Can the application of any part(s) of the Iranian Financial Sanctions 
Regulations (IFSR) be waived by the Department of the Treasury?</p> <p><a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr2194.pdf">The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act </a> (CISADA) provides for a waiver of the sanctions under the Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9874a1de71122f946a56d27417c6c372&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr561_main_02.tpl">IFSR</a>) if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that a waiver is necessary to the national interest of the United States.</p> <p>159.

 and to take additional steps with respect to Iran. Effective as of 
12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 6, 2012, the order blocks 
all property and interests in property of the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=886e9a4661c69615cd12ec3ed697d807&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1321&amp;rgn=div8">Government of Iran </a>(including the Central Bank of Iran), all <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d6b227d293738d9667369e986e3fcd9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1320&amp;rgn=div8">Iranian financial institutions</a>,
 and all persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, to be owned or controlled by, 
or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or 
indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to the order. [02-06-2012]</p> <p>160. Section 1 of 
E.O. 13599 blocks all property and interests in property of the 
Government of Iran, including the Central Bank of Iran, and of all 
Iranian financial institutions, that are in the United States, that come
 within the United States, or that come within the possession or control
 of U.S. persons (including overseas branches). Can you provide further 
clarification about this provision of E.O. 13599? </p> <p><a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_eo_02062012.pdf">E.O. 13599</a>
 requires U.S. persons to block (i.e., freeze) all property and 
interests in property of the Government of Iran, including the Central 
Bank of Iran, and of all Iranian financial institutions, which also 
includes the Central Bank of Iran. This means that all individuals and 
entities that meet the definition of “Government of Iran” (“GOI”) as 
defined by section 7(d) of the new E.O. as well as all Iranian financial
 institutions (whether or not they meet the definition of the GOI) are 
now blocked. Previously, under the Iranian Transactions Regulations, <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0107483c0b76405828ee0a5fcb047046&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr560_main_02.tpl">31 C.F.R. part 560 (the “ITR”)</a>,
 financial institutions and other U.S. persons were prohibited from 
engaging in transactions with the GOI. Under those prior rules, U.S. 
financial institutions receiving instructions to execute transactions 
involving these entities were not required to block the transactions, 
but were instead required to reject those instructions rather than carry
 them out, unless the transactions were exempt, authorized, or not 
prohibited by OFAC. The Executive Order defines an “Iranian financial 
institution” as a financial institution organized under the laws of Iran
 or any jurisdiction within Iran (including foreign branches), any 
financial institution in Iran, any financial institution, wherever 
located, owned or controlled by the Government of Iran, and any 
financial institution, wherever located, owned or controlled by any of 
the aforementioned entities.</p> <p>As a result, transactions involving 
entities bearing the [IRAN] tag on OFAC’s List of Specially Designated 
Nationals and Blocked Persons (“<a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/sdn_data.aspx">SDN List</a>”)
 will now need to be blocked unless exempt or authorized by OFAC. Going 
forward, the [IRAN] tag will connote that a person or entity meets the 
definition of the term “GOI” or “Iranian Financial Institution”. OFAC 
will continue to update the SDN List and may add, delete, or edit 
entries as appropriate. </p> <p>E.O. 13599 blocks the property and 
interests in property of any individual or entity that comes within its 
definition of the term “Government of Iran” regardless of whether it is 
listed on the SDN List, and similarly it blocks the property and 
interests in property of all Iranian financial institutions as defined 
in the order regardless of whether the Iranian financial institution is 
listed on the SDN List.</p> <p>E.O. 13599 builds upon the prohibitions in the ITR, which remain in effect. </p> <p>Please
 note, pursuant to OFAC guidance, even when an entity does not itself 
appear on the SDN List or otherwise meet the definition of the GOI or an
 Iranian financial institution, the property and interests in property 
of that entity are blocked if the entity is owned, directly or 
indirectly, 50% or more by a person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to an Executive Order or regulations 
administered by OFAC. [02-06-2012]</p> <p>161. If all property and 
interests in property of the Government of Iran, including the Central 
Bank of Iran, and of all Iranian financial institutions are blocked, can
 I conduct transactions involving the Government of Iran that have been 
previously authorized by OFAC? </p> <p>Generally yes. Under new General 
License A, almost all transactions that are authorized under existing 
general licenses issued pursuant to the Iranian Transactions Regulations
 (<a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0107483c0b76405828ee0a5fcb047046&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr560_main_02.tpl">ITR</a>) or under existing OFAC specific licenses will continue to be authorized under the authority of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_eo_02062012.pdf">E.O. 13599</a>.
 However, transactions previously authorized under one existing ITR 
general license are not authorized pursuant to E.O. 13599. Specifically,
 the closing of accounts of the Government of Iran or an Iranian 
financial institution and the lump sum transfer of the balances to an 
account outside of the United States, which is authorized by sections 
560.517(a)(3) &amp; (b)(2) of the ITR, is not authorized by General 
License A, and, therefore, those transactions are prohibited by E.O. 
13599 and the accounts must be blocked. In addition, General License A

 prohibit virtually all direct or indirect transactions involving Iran 
or the Government of Iran by U.S. persons or with a nexus to the United 
States, unless otherwise authorized by OFAC or exempted by statute, but 
they do not contain blocking provisions. <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_eo_02062012.pdf">E.O. 13599</a>
 requires U.S. persons to block all property and interests in property 
of the Government of Iran, including the Central Bank of Iran, and of 
Iranian financial institutions, which also includes the Central Bank of 
Iran, unless it relates to a transaction that is exempted by statute or 
authorized by OFAC. </p> <p>To illustrate the difference between how a 
transaction would be treated under the ITR and the new E.O., imagine a 
commercial wire transfer being processed through the U.S. financial 
system by order of a third-country, non-U.S. company for credit to a 
third-country financial institution in favor of a correspondent account 
it maintains for an Iranian financial institution. The transaction is 
not exempt or authorized by a general or specific license, and the 
Iranian bank is not blocked pursuant to the GTSR or the WMDPSR. 
Previously, under the ITR, any U.S. financial institution handling the 
transaction would have needed to reject the payment because allowing it 
to be processed would constitute a prohibited exportation of services to
 Iran. With the new E.O. in place, the U.S. financial institution would 
be required to block (“freeze”) that transaction. [02-06-2012] </p> <p>164.
 The Iranian Transactions Regulations (ITR) authorize U.S. depository 
institutions and U.S. registered brokers or dealers in securities to 
process transfers of funds to or from Iran if the transfer is a 
non-commercial, personal remittance. Are U.S. depository institutions 
and U.S. registered brokers or dealers in securities still authorized to
 process such payments to or from a Government of Iran-owned bank that 
is not otherwise designated pursuant to another part of 31 C.F.R.

 December 31, 2011, the President signed into law the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Public Law 112-81 (“<a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ndaa_publaw.pdf">NDAA</a>”).
 Section 1245 of this statute requires the President to block the 
property and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction of all 
Iranian financial institutions, including the Central Bank of Iran 
(“CBI”). It also aims to reduce Iranian oil revenues and discourage 
transactions with the CBI by providing for sanctions on foreign 
financial institutions that knowingly conduct or facilitate certain 
significant financial transactions with the CBI. Although the sanctions 
on foreign financial institutions authorized by section 1245 are similar
 to the financial sanctions under <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr2194.pdf">the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act </a>
 of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8513(c)) (“CISADA”) (i.e., prohibiting and/or 
imposing strict conditions on opening or maintaining correspondent 
accounts or payable-through accounts in the United States), there are 
differences in the scope and operation of the two statutes. [02-14-2012]</p> <p>169. What is the NDAA?</p> <p>On December 31, 2011, the President signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act (<a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ndaa_publaw.pdf">NDAA</a>).
 Section 1245 of the NDAA requires the President to block the property 
and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction of all Iranian 
financial institutions, including the Central Bank of Iran (CBI). It 
also aims to reduce Iranian oil revenues and discourage transactions 
with the CBI by providing for sanctions on foreign financial 
institutions that knowingly conduct or facilitate certain significant 
financial transactions with the CBI. [02-14-2012]</p> <p>170. What activities can trigger sanctions on a foreign financial institution under the NDAA? </p> <p>For
 private financial institutions, the Act mandates that the President 
sanction those institutions that are found to knowingly conduct or 
facilitate any significant transactions with a U.S.-designated Iranian 
financial institution or with the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) – whether 
for the purchase of petroleum or otherwise – unless the transaction is 
for the sale of food, medicine, or medical devices to Iran. For all 
transactions with the CBI other than petroleum purchases, this provision
 takes effect on February 29, 2012, i.e., 60 days after the enactment of
 the Act. The timing of the petroleum purchase sanctions is discussed 
immediately below.</p> <p>Private financial institutions and all other 
foreign financial institutions – including central banks or foreign 
state-owned or -controlled banks – potentially face sanctions under the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ndaa_publaw.pdf">NDAA </a>if
 they knowingly conduct or facilitate significant financial transactions
 for the purchase of Iranian petroleum or petroleum products with a 
U.S.-designated Iranian financial institution or with the CBI after the 
provision takes effect as early as June 28, 2012, i.e., 180 days after 
enactment.* This NDAA provision may be held in abeyance beyond June 28, 
2012, depending on the President’s determination on the availability and
 price of alternative supplies. Foreign central and foreign state-owned 
or -controlled banks are also subject to these sanctions if the 
transactions are for the sale of petroleum or petroleum products to Iran
 and they occur after June 28, 2012.</p> <p>All foreign financial institutions, including private and state-owned institutions, remain subject to section 104(c) of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr2194.pdf">the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act </a>
 (CISADA), which calls for sanctions on foreign financial institutions 
that are found to have knowingly engaged in facilitating significant 
transactions for specific Iranian-linked individuals and entities. 
[02-14-2012]</p> <p>*Irrespective of the timeframes set forth in the 
NDAA, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates 
significant transactions with any U.S.-designated Iranian financial 
institution would still be subject to CISADA.</p> <p>171. Does the NDAA 
(National Defense Authorization Act) repeal or amend Section 104(c) of 
CISADA (the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment
 Act)?</p> <p>No. Any foreign financial institution that knowingly 
facilitates significant transactions or provides significant financial 
services for a U.S.-designated, Iranian-linked financial institution can
 be sanctioned under section 104(c) of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr2194.pdf">CISADA</a> and section 561.201 of the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9874a1de71122f946a56d27417c6c372&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr561_main_02.tpl">Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations </a>(“IFSR”) even if those transactions are not sanctionable under section 1245(d) of the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ndaa_publaw.pdf">NDAA</a>.
 Though the NDAA imposes sanctions on foreign financial institutions 
similar to financial sanctions under CISADA and the IFSR (i.e., 
prohibiting and/or imposing strict conditions on opening or maintaining <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1306&amp;rgn=div8">correspondent accounts </a>or <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1307&amp;rgn=div8">payable-through accounts </a>in the United States), there are differences in the scope and operation of the statutes. [02-14-2012]</p> <p>172.
 How does Executive Order 13599, “Blocking Property of the Government of
 Iran and Iranian Financial Institutions,” and the blocking of all 
Iranian financial institutions affect the financial sanctions provisions
 in CISADA? Do CISADA sanctions now apply to financial transactions with
 any Iranian financial institution? </p> <p><a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr2194.pdf">The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act</a>
 (CISADA) applies to transactions with only those Iranian financial 
institutions that are designated in connection with Iran’s WMD or 
terrorism activities and are denoted on OFAC’s List of Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (<a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/sdn_data.aspx">the SDN list</a>) with the [IFSR] tag. While <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_eo_02062012.pdf">E.O. 13599 </a>does block the property of all <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d6b227d293738d9667369e986e3fcd9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1320&amp;rgn=div8">Iranian financial institutions</a>,
 that action is not grounded in the authorities that relate to 
counterproliferation or counterterrorism, and therefore does not 
implicate CISADA. [02-14-2012]</p> <p>173. Are there any exceptions to the sanctions provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)?</p> <p>Yes. The <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ndaa_publaw.pdf">NDAA</a>
 includes an exception that prohibits the President from imposing 
sanctions “with respect to any person for conducting or facilitating a 
transaction for the sale of food, medicine, or medical devices to Iran.”
 [02-14-2012]</p> <p>174. What are definitions for the following NDAA 
terms: “significant financial transaction,” “knowingly,” “owned or 
controlled by the government of a foreign country,” “food, medicine, and
 medical devices,” “foreign financial institution,” “Iranian financial 
institution,” “significantly reduced,” and “whether the price and supply
 of petroleum and petroleum products produced in countries other than 
Iran is sufficient”?</p> <p>“significant financial transaction”</p> <p><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9874a1de71122f946a56d27417c6c372&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr561_main_02.tpl">The Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations </a>(IFSR), which implement section 104(c) of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr2194.pdf">the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act</a> (CISADA), identify factors to be used in determining what is significant (as it relates to transactions) in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1404&amp;rgn=div8">31 C.F.R § 561.404</a>,
 which allows the Secretary of the Treasury to consider the “totality of
 the facts and circumstances” while providing a list of seven broad 
factors that can play a role in the determination, including: (1) the 
size, number, and frequency of transactions; (2) the nature of the 
transaction(s); (3) the level of awareness of management and whether the
 transaction(s) are part of a pattern of conduct; (4) the nexus between 
the transaction(s) and a blocked person; (5) the impact of the 
transaction(s) on statutory objectives; (6) whether the transaction(s) 
involve deceptive practices; and (7) such other factors that the 
Secretary deems relevant on a case-by-case basis. Treasury anticipates 
closely modeling the definition of “significant” for National Defense 
Authorization Act (<a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ndaa_publaw.pdf">NDAA</a>) purposes on the IFSR.</p> <p>We
 anticipate utilizing a broad definition of “financial transaction” that
 encompasses “any transfer of value involving a financial institution.” 
The term “transaction” includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p> <ul>
<li><p>The holding of nostro, vostro, or loro accounts for or with the 
Central Bank of Iran or designated banks, such as Bank Melli Iran and/or
 Bank Saderat Iran, including any of their branches or subsidiaries 
worldwide (collectively the “Listed Parties”);</p></li> <li><p>The provision of trade finance and/or letter of credit services for or with Listed Parties;</p></li> <li><p>The provision of guarantees or similar instruments for or with Listed Parties;</p></li> <li><p>The
 provision of investment products or instruments for Listed Parties 
and/or the participation with Listed Parties in investments;</p></li> <li><p>The receipt or origination of wire transfers on behalf of or involving Listed Parties;</p></li> <li><p>The
 acceptance of commercial paper (both retail and wholesale) drawn on 
Listed Parties, and the clearance of such paper (including, but not 
limited to, checks and similar drafts);</p></li> <li><p>The receipt or origination of ACH or ATM transactions with Listed Parties; and/or</p></li> <li><p>Any
 other transactions for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Listed 
Parties and/or with Listed Parties serving as correspondents, 
respondents, or beneficiaries. That would include transactions where the
 Listed Parties do not appear on the face of the transaction but where 
the transaction is undertaken with knowledge of the involvement of a 
Listed Party based on a relationship that exists through a third party 
such as a money exchange or trading house.</p></li>
</ul> <p>“knowingly” </p> <p>The <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9874a1de71122f946a56d27417c6c372&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr561_main_02.tpl">IFSR</a>
 defines “knowingly” with respect to conduct, a circumstance, or a 
result, to mean that an entity or individual had actual knowledge, or 
should have known, about the conduct, the circumstance, or the result. <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1314&amp;rgn=div8">31 C.F.R. § 561.314</a>. Treasury anticipates closely modeling the definition of this term on the IFSR. </p> <p>“owned or controlled by the government of a foreign country” </p> <p>The <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0107483c0b76405828ee0a5fcb047046&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr560_main_02.tpl">Iranian Transactions Regulations </a>(“ITR”) define “an entity owned or controlled by the Government of Iran” in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=ef23efe363027edbc736ef9c2acaae3a&amp;mc=true&amp;r=PART&amp;n=pt31.3.560#se31.3.560_1313">section 560.313</a>.
 Borrowing from that definition, a financial institution “owned or 
controlled by the government of a foreign country” would be deemed to 
include a financial institution in which a foreign government owns a 50%
 or greater interest or which is otherwise controlled by a foreign 
government. Treasury anticipates closely modeling the definition of this
 term under the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ndaa_publaw.pdf">NDAA</a> on the ITR definition. </p> <p>“food, medicine, and medical devices” </p> <p>“Food”:
 The October 2011 general license for the ITR and the Sudanese Sanctions
 Regulations (“SSR”) authorizing certain food exports to Iran and Sudan 
defines “food” as “items that are intended to be consumed by and provide
 nutrition to humans or animals in Iran – including vitamins and 
minerals, food additives and supplements, and bottled drinking water – 
and seeds that germinate into items that are intended to be consumed by 
and provide nutrition to humans or animals in Iran.” The regulations 
also specify that food does not include alcoholic beverages, cigarettes,
 gum, or fertilizer. Treasury anticipates closely modeling the

entity that is engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making, 
granting, transferring, holding, or brokering loans or credits, or 
purchasing or selling foreign exchange, securities, or commodity futures
 or options, or procuring purchasers and sellers thereof, as principal 
or agent. It includes but is not limited to depository institutions,

 Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury,
 the Secretary of Energy, and the Director of National Intelligence, 
will make determinations as to whether any country has significantly 
reduced the volume of Iranian crude oil purchases. Any determinations 
will be preceded by a process of rigorous due diligence. The Secretary 
of State intends to consider relevant evidence in assessing each 
country’s efforts to reduce the volume of crude oil imported from Iran, 
including the quantity and percentage of the reduction in purchases of 
Iranian crude oil over the relevant period, termination of contracts for
 future delivery of Iranian crude oil, and other actions that 
demonstrate a commitment to substantially decrease such purchases.</p> <p>“whether the price and supply of petroleum and petroleum products produced in countries other than Iran is sufficient” </p> <p>The President will make a determination, based on the reports required by subparagraph (A) of Section 1245(d)(4) of the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ndaa_publaw.pdf">NDAA</a>,
 as to whether the price and supply of petroleum and petroleum products 
produced in countries other than Iran is sufficient to permit purchasers
 of petroleum and petroleum products from Iran to reduce significantly 
in volume their purchases from Iran. [02-14-2012]</p> <p>175. What is the scope of “petroleum products” under the law? </p> <p>As
 defined by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), petroleum 
products include unfinished oils, liquefied petroleum gases, pentanes 
plus, aviation gasoline, motor gasoline, naphtha-type jet fuel, 
kerosene-type jet fuel, kerosene, distillate fuel oil, residual fuel 
oil, petrochemical feedstocks, special naphthas, lubricants, waxes, 
petroleum coke, asphalt, road oil, still gas, and miscellaneous products
 obtained from the processing of crude oil (including lease condensate),
 natural gas, and other hydrocarbon compounds. In keeping with the EIA’s
 standard definition, petroleum products do not include natural gas, 
liquefied natural gas, biofuels, methanol, and other non-petroleum 
fuels. [02-14-2012]</p> <p>176. If oil is being provided as payment for an outstanding debt, is such a transfer considered a “financial transaction”? </p> <p>If a transfer involves a financial institution it would likely be considered a financial transaction. [02-14-2012]</p> <p>177.
 If the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) is involved in providing settlement 
services for a transaction, or is otherwise acting solely as an 
intermediary in a transaction between a non-designated Iranian bank and a
 foreign financial institution, is the foreign financial institution 
deemed to be engaging in a transaction with the CBI?</p> <p>Section 1245
 targets any significant transactions “with” the CBI; a transaction 
involving the CBI in an intermediary role would likely be viewed as a 
transaction “with” the CBI. [02-14-2012]</p> <p>178. Are barter trades involving the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) considered “financial transactions” under Section 1245?</p> <p>If a transfer involves a financial institution it would likely be considered a financial transaction. [02-14-2012]</p> <p>179.
 Does the definition of “significant financial transaction” exclude the 
passive holding of Central Bank of Iran (CBI) reserves? Is the U.S. 
willing to give assurances that this will not be a basis for sanctions?</p> <p>This
 will be a case-by-case determination and will require specifics on what
 “passive holding” entails. As a general matter, we would likely not 
view the holding of reserves as sanctionable in the following 
circumstances: the accounts are frozen or restricted, under which the 
CBI would be allowed to maintain accounts that it had already opened as 
of December 31, 2011, but would otherwise be unable to direct the 
disposition of those funds, with ordinary commercial interest payments 
and routine roll-overs of time deposits under pre-existing instructions 
being the only new transactions. [02-14-2012]</p> <p>180. Are payments 
made under contracts existing prior to the date of enactment of the 
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) statute (December 31, 2011) 
exempted from the definition of “significant transactions”? </p> <p>No 
general exception will be provided for payments arising out of 
pre-existing contracts. The assessment of whether such payments are 
“significant” will be done on a case-by-case basis in line with the 
criteria discussed in <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#174">FAQ #174</a>. [02-14-2012]</p> <p>181.
 Will the U.S. refrain from sanctioning foreign financial institutions 
that receive funds from the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) to repay loans? 
What if these loans were granted for projects that might be subject to 
the food, medicine, and medical device exemptions under the National 
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)? </p> <p>As noted, no general exception
 will be provided for payments arising out of pre-existing contracts. 
The assessment of whether such payments are “significant” will be done 
on a case-by-case basis in line with the criteria discussed in <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#174">FAQ #174</a>. Regarding payments for food, medicine, and medical devices, the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ndaa_publaw.pdf">NDAA</a>
 does not allow sanctions based on transactions for the sale of food, 
medicine, or medical devices to Iran. Payments related to the export of 
broader humanitarian items would be dealt with in our analysis of what 
constitutes a “significant financial transaction” and would be 
considered on a case-by-case basis. [02-14-2012] </p> <p>182. Is there a
 difference between entities that have been designated by the United 
States Government for illicit conduct, such as proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction or support for terrorism, and those that are being 
blocked under E.O. 13599? How can I tell which entities appear on the 
Specially Designated National (SDN) List for which reasons? </p> <p>Both blocked and designated entities appear on<a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/sdn_data.aspx"> the SDN List</a>.</p> <p>“Blocked” persons, in the context of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_eo_02062012.pdf">E.O. 13599</a>,
 appear on the SDN List due to the United States Government’s 
identification of these entities as the Government of Iran and/or as an <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d6b227d293738d9667369e986e3fcd9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1320&amp;rgn=div8">Iranian financial institution</a>.
 Such entities are identified on the SDN List with the tag [IRAN]. For 
example, Bank Keshavarzi is a Government of Iran owned Iranian financial
 institution and is identified with the [IRAN] tag. Additionally, the 
National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) is a non-financial institution that 
has been identified as the Government of Iran and bears the [IRAN] tag.</p> <p>“Designated”
 persons appear on the SDN List due to the United States Government’s 
having determined that they meet the criteria set forth in any of a 
number of other Executive Orders concerning, for example, assisting 
Iran’s weapons of mass destruction development, or aiding international 
terrorism and designating them for such activities. Such entities are 
identified on the SDN List with various tags other than [IRAN], such as 
[NPWMD] or [SDGT]. For example, Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines 
is listed as: “IRISL [NPWMD].”</p> <p>Note that many entries on the SDN 
List have more than one tag. For example: Bank Saderat Iran has three 
tags: [SDGT], indicating that it has been sanctioned for providing 
services to terrorism; [IRAN], indicating that it is the Government of 
Iran; and [IFSR], referring to the Iranian Financial Sanctions 
Regulations to signal to third country financial institutions that 
engage with entities with this tag that they risk sanctions under 
CISADA. [02-14-2012]</p> <p></p> <p></p><h2>Executive Order 13606 (the GHRAVITY E.O.)</h2> <p><a href=""> Print this topic</a></p> <p>On April 22, 2012, the President signed <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/13606.pdf">Executive Order 13606 </a>Blocking
 The Property And Suspending Entry into the United States of Certain 
Persons with Respect to Grave Human Rights Abuses by the Governments of

Effective 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 23, 2012, the 
GHRAVITY E.O. blocks all property and interests in property of persons

Treasury, in consultation with or at the recommendation of the Secretary
 of State, to meet the criteria in the order. [04-23-2012]</p> <p>183. Why did the President issue the GHRAVITY E.O.?</p> <p>The <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/13606.pdf">GHRAVITY E.O.</a>
 follows prior Executive orders issued by the President in response to 
the commission of human rights abuses by the Governments of Iran and 
Syria. With the GHRAVITY E.O., the President recognized that the 
commission of serious human rights abuses against the people of Iran and
 Syria by their governments, facilitated by computer and network 
disruption, monitoring, and tracking by those governments, threatens the
 national security and foreign policy of the United States. The GHRAVITY
 E.O. targets this activity in order to deter and disrupt such abuses. 
[04-23-2012]</p> <p>184. What does the GHRAVITY E.O. do?</p> <p>The <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/13606.pdf">GHRAVITY E.O.</a>
 blocks (i.e., freezes) the property and interests in property of, among
 others, any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with or at the recommendation of the Secretary of State, 
(1) to have operated, or to have directed the operation of, information 
and communications technology that facilitates computer or network 
disruption, monitoring, or tracking that could assist in or enable 
serious human rights abuses by or on behalf of the Government of Iran or
 the Government of Syria; or (2) to have sold, leased, or otherwise

 or Syria likely to be used to facilitate such activities.</p> <p>U.S. 
persons in possession of property or interests in property belonging to 
persons listed in the Annex to the GHRAVITY E.O., or designated in the 
future by Treasury under the E.O., are obligated to block the property 
and report the blocking to OFAC within 10 days of blocking. Entities 
that are 50% or more owned by persons blocked by the GHRAVITY E.O. are 
also blocked, regardless of whether such entities appear on the Annex or
 OFAC’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (“<a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/sdn_data.aspx">SDN list</a>”). [04-23-2012]</p> <p>185.

 targets the provision and use of information and communications 
technology to facilitate computer or network disruption, monitoring, or 
tracking that could assist in or enable serious human rights abuses by 
or on behalf of the Government of Iran or the Government of Syria. It is
 not intended to block exports of technology that enable the Syrian and 
Iranian people to freely communicate among themselves and with the 
outside world. </p> <p>“Information and communications technology” means
 any hardware, software, or other product or service primarily intended 
to fulfill or enable the function of information processing and 
communication by electronic means, including transmission and display, 
including via the Internet. [04-23-2012]</p> <p>186.

 bearing the [HRIT] tag. U.S. persons are obligated to block property 
involving the persons bearing the tag [HRIT] on the SDN list, unless the
 transaction is exempt or otherwise authorized by OFAC. [04-23-2012]</p> <p>187. Does the GHRAVITY E.O. prohibit me from exporting technology to companies that do business with Iran or Syria?</p> <p>This
 E.O. does not generally prohibit transactions involving persons that do
 business with Iran or Syria, unless the person has been designated 
pursuant to this order. You should consult with the Department of 
Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) regarding exports to 
companies that do business with Syria. [04-23-2012]</p> <p>188. If I am a
 non-U.S. company that exports information and communications technology
 to Iran or Syria, will I be designated under the GHRAVITY E.O.?</p> <p>The
 measures in this order are designed primarily to address the need to 
prevent entities located in whole or in part in Iran and Syria from 
facilitating or committing serious human rights abuses. These measures 
are not designed to prevent the provision of information and 
communications technology necessary to enable the Iranian and Syrian 
people to freely communicate with each other and the outside world. That
 said, those providing communications technology to Iran or Syria that 
has the potential to facilitate computer or network disruption, 
monitoring, or tracking should exercise great caution given Iran and 
Syria’s use of this technology to assist in the commission of serious 
human rights abuses. [04-23-2012]</p> <p>189. Would I need authorization
 from OFAC or BIS if I wanted to export goods or technology to persons

 Executive Order (Prohibiting Certain Transactions with and Suspending 
Entry into the United States of Foreign Sanctions Evaders with Respect 
to Iran and Syria)</h2> <p><a href=""> Print this topic</a></p> <p>191. 
What does Executive Order 13608 “Prohibiting Certain Transactions with 
and Suspending Entry into the United States of Foreign Sanctions Evaders
 with Respect to Iran and Syria” do?</p> <p><a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/fse_eo.pdf">This Executive Order</a>
 gives Treasury new authorities. First, it strengthens Treasury’s 
ability to address behavior by foreign individuals and entities 
determined to have violated, attempted to violate, conspired to violate,
 or caused a violation of U.S. sanctions on Syria or Iran. This E.O. 
also gives Treasury the authority to impose sanctions on foreign persons
 who have facilitated deceptive transactions for or on behalf of persons
 subject to U.S. sanctions.</p> <p>Transactions by U.S. persons or 
within the United States involving persons sanctioned under this 
authority are prohibited, effectively cutting the listed persons off 
from the U.S. marketplace and financial system. By cutting off access to
 the U.S. marketplace and financial system to such sanctions evaders, 
Executive Order 13608 provides Treasury with a powerful tool to prevent 
and deter such behavior and to hold such persons accountable and to 
convince them to change their behavior. Publicly identifying such 
persons will also allow U.S. persons to avoid unwittingly engaging in 
transactions with identified foreign persons that may expose U.S. 
persons to the risk of sanctions violations. [05-01-2012]</p> <p>192. Why was this authority needed?</p> <p><a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/fse_eo.pdf">Executive Order 13608</a>
 expands Treasury’s ability to address the behavior of foreign persons 
determined to have violated or attempted to violate U.S. sanctions on 
Syria or Iran, or to have facilitated deceptive transactions on behalf 
of persons subject to those sanctions, where the foreign person had no 
physical, financial, or other presence in the United States and did not 
submit to U.S. administrative proceedings. Treasury may use this 
authority where it appears that a foreign person violated U.S. sanctions
 on Iran or Syria but may not meet criteria for designation under 
existing Executive Orders. Executive Order 13608 will provide a means 
through which Treasury can limit the risk to U.S. commercial and 
financial systems posed by foreign persons determined to have violated 
U.S. sanctions on Iran or Syria, or to have engaged in deceptive 
transactions for or on behalf of persons subject to U.S. sanctions on 
Iran or Syria.</p> <p>Such a listing under Executive Order 13608 also 
provides Treasury with the capability to put the world on notice as to 
such foreign persons’ activity and the risk of similar future activity. 
Such identification will help prevent U.S. persons from unwittingly 
engaging in transactions with foreign persons that may pose a risk of 
sanctions violations. [05-01-2012]</p> <p>193. What are the repercussions of an individual or entity being identified under Executive Order 13608?</p> <p>If
 an individual or entity is made subject to sanctions under this 
authority, U.S. persons generally may no longer provide to or procure 
from such individual or entity any goods, services, or technology. From a
 practical standpoint, it means that the sanctioned individual or entity
 will be cut off from the U.S. commercial and financial systems. 
[05-01-2012]</p> <p>194. Are U.S. persons required to block the property of individuals and entities identified under Executive Order 13608? </p> <p>No. Identifications or listings under <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/fse_eo.pdf">Executive Order 13608</a>
 do not block any assets. However, a U.S. person may not provide or 
procure goods or services, including financial services, or technology 
to or from a listed person without authorization from OFAC, unless the 
transaction is otherwise exempt from regulation under the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act </a>(e.g., certain travel-related transactions). [05-01-2012]</p> <p>336. How do I know whether a person is identified under E.O. 13608?</p> <p>Please refer to the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/fse_list.aspx">Foreign Sanctions Evaders (FSE) List</a>. [02-06-2014]</p> <p>195. I am a financial institution. What do I do if I receive a wire transfer involving a listed party?</p> <p>A
 U.S. financial institution must reject any wire transfer involving a 
listed person and file a report with OFAC within 10 days. [05-01-2012]</p> <p>196. I am a financial institution and I hold an account for a listed person. What do I do with the funds?</p> <p>The
 account is not blocked; however, it is restricted and you cannot allow 
it to be operated without authorization from OFAC. [05-01-2012]</p> <p>197. What are U.S. persons obligated to do with property of a person listed under Executive Order 13608?</p> <p>Property
 of a listed person is not blocked, but U.S. persons must have 
authorization from OFAC to provide or procure such property to or from a
 listed person, or to provide or procure services to or from a listed 
person in connection with such property. Additionally, wire transfers 
involving the assets of an Executive Order 13608-listed person must be 
rejected. [05-01-2012]</p> <p>198. May a U.S. person deal with an Executive Order 13608-listed person so long as the dealing does not involve Iran or Syria? </p> <p>No. U.S. persons are prohibited from all transactions or dealings described in <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/fse_eo.pdf">Executive Order 13608</a>
 with persons listed under Executive Order 13608, unless authorized by 
OFAC or where the transaction is otherwise exempt from regulation under 
the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act </a>. [05-01-2012]</p> <p>199. How is an identification or listing under Executive Order 13608 different from a designation? </p> <p>Like
 a designation, a U.S. person is prohibited, unless authorized by OFAC 
or if the underlying transaction is exempt from regulation under the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act </a>,
 from dealing with an identified or listed person. Unlike a blocking 
designation, the property and the interests in property of a person 
listed under Executive Order 13608 are not blocked. [05-01-2012]</p> <p>200. How is this different from lists maintained by the Department of Commerce? </p> <p>Treasury’s authority under <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/fse_eo.pdf">Executive Order 13608</a> has some similarities to Commerce’s authority under the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7d3b68a397d025734d702b5a0c048bb0&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title15/15CVIIsubchapC.tpl">Export Administration Regulations</a>
 (“EAR”). Commerce may impose denial orders on persons (both foreign and
 U.S.) who have committed violations of the EAR or present an imminent 
risk of committing a violation. These individuals or organizations are 
listed on Commerce’s Denied Persons List. It is prohibited to deal with 
Denied Persons in any export transaction involving items (commodities, 
software, and technology) subject to the EAR. Treasury’s authority under
 Executive Order 13608 complements Commerce’s authority by addressing at
 least two types of sanctions violations that are outside the scope of 
the EAR. Specifically, Treasury may prohibit the provision of services 
(in addition to goods and technology) to or from identified or listed 
persons and Treasury may prohibit transactions or dealings involving 
goods and technology that are not subject to the EAR. However, unlike 
Commerce’s authority, Treasury’s authority to sanction or list an 
individual or entity under Executive Order 13608 may be implemented only
 with respect to foreign individuals or entities. [05-01-2012]</p> <p>201.
 May a U.S. person deal with a person listed under Executive Order 13608
 in a transaction that was previously licensed by OFAC?</p> <p>No. U.S. 
persons cannot have any dealings with a person identified or listed 
under this Executive Order absent specific authorization from OFAC 
pursuant to the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/fse_eo.pdf">Executive Order 13608</a>, unless the transaction is exempt from regulation under the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act </a>. [05-01-2012]</p> <p>202. What if the transaction is already underway?</p> <p>If
 a transaction is underway at the time of a listing, a U.S. person must 
cease dealing with the listed person and the U.S. person is prohibited 
from engaging in transactions or dealings in or related to any goods, 
services, or technology to or from the listed person, unless the 
transaction is exempt under the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act </a>, or until such time that OFAC authorizes the transactions pursuant to the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/fse_eo.pdf">Executive Order 13608</a>.
 Additionally, if the transaction underway involves a wire transfer, a 
U.S. financial institution must reject it and file a report with OFAC 
within 10 days.</p> <p>Like all of its programs, OFAC has the authority 
under Executive Order 13608 to license transactions that are consistent 
with U.S. foreign policy. [05-01-2012]</p> <p>203. Can a U.S. person use a listed person to facilitate personal remittances to or from Iran or Syria?</p> <p>No.
 Without specific authorization from OFAC, U.S. persons cannot use a 
listed person to process personal remittances. [05-01-2012]</p> <p>204. Will Treasury pursue an enforcement action before identifying or listing a person pursuant to Executive Order 13608?</p> <p>The authorities granted under <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/fse_eo.pdf">this Executive Order</a>
 are in addition to current authorities that Treasury has to pursue an 
enforcement action for violations of U.S. law, and Treasury is not 
required to pursue a civil enforcement action prior to identifying or 
listing a person pursuant to Executive Order 13608. [05-01-2012]</p> <p></p> <p></p><h2>Treasury CISADA Findings Against Bank of Kunlun</h2> <p><a href=""> Print this topic</a></p> <p>207.
 What were the criteria for this finding? How many other institutions 
were you looking at and why did you decide to take action against Bank 
of Kunlun?</p> <p>Based on information made available to the Treasury Department, the Department has found that China’s Bank of Kunlun has <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1314&amp;rgn=div8">knowingly</a>
 facilitated significant transactions for various Iranian-linked banks 
designated by the United States under our WMD or terrorism authorities.</p> <p>Upon finding that Bank of Kunlun was knowingly engaged in these activities that are sanctionable under <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr2194.pdf">the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act</a> (CISADA), the Secretary of the Treasury has prohibited U.S. banks from opening or maintaining <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1306&amp;rgn=div8">correspondent accounts</a> or <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1307&amp;rgn=div8">payable-through accounts</a> in the United States for Bank of Kunlun – effectively cutting off Bank of Kunlun’s direct access to the U.S. financial system.</p> <p>Since
 CISADA was signed into law in July 2010, Treasury has engaged with over
 120 financial institutions and bank regulators in more than 60 
countries all over the world to brief them on the financial provisions 
of CISADA, and, in cases where we had specific concerns, has shared 
information about those concerns.</p> <p>This global engagement campaign
 has proven highly successful, as we have seen the overwhelming majority
 of financial institutions with which we have engaged change their 
business practices – even close any correspondent accounts with U.S. 
designated Iranian banks – to ensure that their access to the U.S. 
financial system is not put at risk. </p> <p>The July 31, 2012 action against Bank of Kunlun was in response to its ongoing relationships with U.S.-designated Iranian banks.</p> <p>Note:
 The Treasury Department had also made a CISADA finding against Iraq’s 
Elaf Islamic Bank on July 31, 2012. On May 17, 2013, Elaf Islamic Bank 
was delisted and its name was removed from<a href="https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/561list.pdf"> the Part 561 List</a>. [05-17-2013]</p> <p>208. How are you defining “significant” transactions and financial services?</p> <p>In
 determining whether transactions or financial services are significant,
 the Secretary of the Treasury may consider a number of factors related 
to the transactions or services, including, but not limited to: size, 
number, and frequency; type, complexity and commercial purpose; the 
level of awareness or involvement by the bank’s management; whether the 
activity or payment illustrates a pattern of practice or is an isolated 
event; the ultimate economic benefit conferred upon the designated 
person(s); and whether the transactions involved the use of deceptive 
financial practices to obscure the identities of the parties involved. </p> <p>Bank of Kunlun</p> <p>Bank
 of Kunlun has provided hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of 
services to U.S. designated Iranian banks. These financial services 
include maintaining accounts, transferring payments, and serving as the 
paying bank for letters of credit opened by U.S. designated Iranian 
banks. The facilitation of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars worth of
 transactions with U.S. designated Iranian banks over the past year is 
significant.</p> <p>In 2012, after Treasury designated Bank Tejarat, 
Bank of Kunlun transferred hundreds of payments totaling approximately 
$100 million dollars for accounts it holds for Bank Tejarat and made a 
payment for an IRGC affiliate pursuant to a letter of credit opened by 
Bank Tejarat. [05-17-2013]</p> <p>209.

 What are the consequences for a U.S. financial institution that

 $250,000 or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater. </p> <p>Criminal
 penalties of up to $1 million can be imposed for willful violations, 
and individuals who willfully violate the prohibition can face up to 20 
years in prison. [05-17-2013]</p> <p>211. If a foreign financial 
institution continues to do business with Bank of Kunlun, could that 
lead to a CISADA finding against the other institution? </p> <p>Any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates significant <span>transactions</span>on behalf of designated Iranian banks – whether directly or indirectly – may face<a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr2194.pdf">Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act</a>(CISADA) sanctions. OFAC defines “<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1314&amp;rgn=div8">knowingly</a>”
 in this context as meaning the financial institution knew or should 
have known of the conduct, circumstance, or result. Bank of Kunlun has 
demonstrated its willingness to move hundreds of millions dollars on 
behalf of designated Iranian banks. Accordingly, we would expect 
heightened due diligence in any dealings with Bank of Kunlun. 
[05-17-2013]</p> <p>212. Does this finding affect Bank of Kunlun’s 
branches or subsidiaries around the world? Does this finding affect any 
holding companies? </p> <p>The prohibitions implemented as a result of 
today’s action apply to Bank of Kunlun and all of its offices, around 
the world. [05-17-2013]</p> <p>213. Are United States financial 
institutions that do not hold correspondent or payable-through accounts 
for Bank of Kunlun required to block or reject transactions that 
otherwise involve Bank of Kunlun?</p> <p>No. U.S. financial institutions are not required to block or reject financial or trade transactions that involve Bank of Kunlun.</p> <p>That
 said, we would expect heightened due diligence in any dealings with 
Bank of Kunlun given its demonstrated willingness to facilitate 
transactions on behalf of Iranian banks designated by well over a dozen 
countries worldwide. [05-17-2013]</p> <p>214. What is the licensing 
process for U.S. financial institutions that need to conduct 
transactions in order to close correspondent or payable-through accounts
 with a foreign financial institution sanctioned pursuant to the 
Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act 
(CISADA)?</p> <p>Treasury regulations provide a 10-day period in which 
U.S. financial institutions are authorized to engage in the transactions
 necessary to close an affected account. If a U.S. financial institution
 that is in the process of closing an affected account seeks to engage 
in transactions beyond those already authorized, Treasury may issue 
specific licenses on a case-by-case basis. [05-17-2013]</p> <p>215. What

 2012 (TRA) requires the Secretary of the Treasury, no later than 45 
days after the date of the enactment of TRA, to determine whether the 
National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) or the National Iranian Tanker 
Company (NITC) is an agent or affiliate of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps (IRGC), and to report to Congress on these determinations 
and the reasons for them. On September 24, 2012, the Department of the 
Treasury made a determination that NIOC is an agent or affiliate of the 
IRGC. Based on the information currently available, Treasury is not able
 to determine at this time whether NITC is an agent or affiliate of the 
IRGC.</p> <p>233. Isn’t the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) already subject to sanctions?</p> <p>Yes. <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/13622.pdf">Executive Order 13622</a>
 provides for sanctions on foreign financial institutions found to have 
knowingly conducted or facilitated significant financial transactions 
with NIOC (except for sales of refined petroleum products to NIOC that 
fall below the dollar threshold that could trigger sanctions under the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/isa_1996.pdf">Iran Sanctions Act</a>).
 Executive Order 13622 also provides authority for the Secretary of the 
Treasury to block the property and interests in property of persons 
determined to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided 
financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services 
in support of, NIOC (as well as other specified entities). Note, 
however, that these sanctions are not applicable to certain transactions
 related to the Shah Deniz pipeline project, in which NIOC has a 
minority stake, under Executive Order 13622. In addition, NIOC was 
already blocked as an entity of the Government of Iran under <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_eo_02062012.pdf">E.O. 13599</a>, which was issued pursuant to the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act </a>(IEEPA),
 as amended, among other authorities. Nevertheless, as described below, 
the determination that NIOC is an agent or affiliate of the IRGC carries
 consequences.</p> <p>234. What is the effect of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) determination? Are there CISADA implications?</p> <p>As a result of this the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr_1905_pl_112_158.pdf">Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act </a> (TRA) section 312 determination, NIOC now is also a person described under section 104(c)(2)(E)(i) of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr2194.pdf">the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act</a> of 2010 (CISADA) as an agent or affiliate of the IRGC whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to<a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf"> IEEPA</a>.
 This means that foreign financial institutions determined to knowingly 
facilitate significant transactions or provide significant financial 
services for NIOC are exposed to CISADA sanctions, including 
prohibitions or the imposition of strict conditions on the opening or 
maintaining of correspondent or payable-through accounts in the United 
States. </p> <p>In addition, section 302 of TRA requires sanctions on 
foreign persons determined to have knowingly provided certain material 
support to, or engaged in significant transactions with, the IRGC or its
 officials, agents, or affiliates whose property or interest in property
 are blocked. Consequently, foreign persons that knowingly engage in 
significant transactions with NIOC after the September 24, 2012 
determination could be exposed to sanctions.</p> <p>An “IRGC” identifier will be added to NIOC’s entry on the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/sdn_data.aspx">Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List </a>available on OFAC’s website. </p> <p>As
 noted below, the potential application of sanctions under section 
104(c)(2)(E)(i) of CISADA and section 302 of TRA is affected by whether 
the country with primary jurisdiction has received a significant 
reduction exception from the Secretary of State.</p> <p>235. What are 
the implications for petroleum purchase transactions involving NIOC by 
financial institutions and entities in countries that have received a 
significant reduction exception from the Secretary of State? </p> <p>Significant
 transactions, financial services, or material support involving 
National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the purchase of Iranian 
petroleum or petroleum products by a foreign financial institution or 
entity based in a country that has received a significant reduction 
exception from the Secretary of State do not carry potential sanctions 
consequences – under <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr2194.pdf">the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act</a> (CISADA), sections 302 and 312 of the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr_1905_pl_112_158.pdf">Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act </a> (TRA), section 1245 of the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ndaa_publaw.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012</a> (NDAA), or sections 1 and 2 of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/13622.pdf">Executive Order 13622</a>.
 Sections 302 and 312 of TRA authorize the President not to impose 
sanctions for the purchase of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran 
if an exception under subsection 1245(d)(4)(D) of the NDAA applies to 
the country with primary jurisdiction over the foreign financial 
institution at the time of the transactions or the provision of 
services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any significant transaction for
 other sanctioned entities (such as Iranian designated banks or other 
persons described in section 104(c)(2)(E) of CISADA) may result in 
sanctions, regardless of whether the transaction is for the purchase of 
petroleum or petroleum products and involves NIOC.</p> <p>236. Does the 
determination regarding the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) mean 
that there is no affiliation between NITC and the IRGC? </p> <p>This 
statement means only that, based on the currently available information,
 Treasury is not able to determine at this time that NITC is an agent or
 affiliate of the IRGC.</p> <p>237. How does the effect of this 
determination compare to the effect of section 1(a) of Executive Order 
13622 as to transactions with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC)?</p> <p>The effect of the determination is similar to the effect of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/13622.pdf">Executive Order 13622</a>
 section 1(a), which provides for prohibitions on the opening of and 
prohibitions or strict conditions on maintaining correspondent accounts 
or payable-through accounts in the United States for foreign financial 
institutions determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, to have knowingly conducted or
 facilitated significant financial transactions with NIOC. Executive 
Order 13622 likewise contains an exception that covers transactions with
 NIOC conducted or facilitated by foreign financial institutions based 
in NDAA-excepted jurisdictions. A significant difference between these 
authorities is that the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ndaa_publaw.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act </a>(NDAA) exception in the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr_1905_pl_112_158.pdf">Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act </a>

 in the United States if they knowingly engage in significant financial 
transactions with the Central Bank of Iran (“CBI”) or a designated 
Iranian financial institution, unless an NDAA exception, such as the 
significant reduction exception, applies. The NDAA significant reduction
 exception applies if the Secretary of State, in consultation with the 
Secretary of the Treasury and other agencies, has determined that the 
country with primary jurisdiction over the FFI has significantly reduced
 its purchases of Iranian crude oil during a specified period of time.</p> <p>Effective
 February 6, 2013, section 504 amends the NDAA in several ways. Most 
importantly, it narrows the NDAA’s significant reduction exception to 
(a) exempt from sanctions only transactions that conduct or facilitate 
bilateral trade in goods or services between the country granted the 
exception and Iran, and (b) require that funds owed to Iran as a result 
of the bilateral trade be credited to an account located in the country 
granted the exception and not be repatriated to Iran. In addition, it - </p> <p>(i)
 eliminates the distinction between state-owned or -controlled FFIs (not
 including foreign central banks) and private FFIs, thereby expanding 
the scope of sanctionable transactions for state-owned or -controlled 
FFIs with the CBI or designated Iranian financial institutions; and</p> <p>(ii)
 clarifies that countries that have reduced their Iranian crude oil 
purchases to zero may continue to receive the significant reduction 
exception.</p> <p>The sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, 
or medical devices to Iran (the “Humanitarian Exception”) is not 
impacted by section 504 of the TRA.</p> <p>The purchase or acquisition 
of petrochemicals from Iran remain sanctionable activities and are not 
subject to the significant reduction exception. [2-6-2013]</p> <p>255. Do the section 504 modifications of the TRA restrict any other dealings with Iran?</p> <p>Yes, the section 504 modifications also narrow the scope of transactions excepted from certain sanctions available under <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/13622.pdf">E.O. 13622</a>. Accordingly, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1308&amp;rgn=div8">foreign financial institutions </a>(FFIs)
 in countries that are determined by the Secretary of State to have 
significantly reduced their purchases of Iranian crude oil pursuant to 
the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ndaa_publaw.pdf">NDAA</a>,
 that knowingly conduct significant financial transactions with the 
National Iranian Oil Company (“NIOC”), the Naftiran Intertrade Company 
(“NICO”), or otherwise for the purchase of petroleum or petroleum 
products from Iran, are only eligible for the significant reduction 
exception if the FFIs adhere to the bilateral trade restrictions, credit
 the funds to an account in the country with primary jurisdiction over 
the FFI, and do not repatriate the funds to Iran. </p> <p>Example 1: A 
FFI in a country which has received a significant reduction exception 
and with primary jurisdiction over the FFI may facilitate a transaction 
enabling an oil refinery in that country to purchase crude oil from Iran
 without having exposure to U.S. correspondent account sanctions, so 
long as the transaction meets section 504’s bilateral trade 
requirements, the funds are credited to an account in the FFI in the 
country with primary jurisdiction over the FFI, and the funds are not 
repatriated to Iran.</p> <p>Example 2: If, however, a FFI in a country 
which has received a significant reduction exception facilitates a third
 country’s crude oil purchase – even a third country with a significant 
reduction exception – from Iran, the FFI would have exposure to 
sanctions because the transaction was not solely for the FFI host 
country’s purchase of crude oil from Iran. [2-6-2013]</p> <p>256. What

meant by the TRA section 504’s requirement that bilateral trade consist 
of trade in goods and services between the country with primary 
jurisdiction over the foreign financial institution (FFI) and Iran?</p> <p>OFAC interprets bilateral trade between Iran and the country with primary jurisdiction over the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1308&amp;rgn=div8">FFI</a> to mean trade in only those goods or services originating in (e.g., produced in or substantially transformed in) – </p> <p>(i) the country with primary jurisdiction over the FFI conducting or facilitating the transaction, or </p><p>(ii)
 Iran (for purposes of the import of Iranian-origin goods or services by
 the country with primary jurisdiction over the FFI),</p><p></p> <p>and the trade in services cannot include brokering transactions involving goods or services from or to third countries.</p> <p>Furthermore,
 the goods or services must be exported and sold directly to either the 
country with primary jurisdiction over the FFI (in the case of 
Iranian-origin goods or services), or Iran (in the case of goods or 
services originating in the country with primary jurisdiction over the 
FFI).</p> <p>The Humanitarian Exception is not impacted by section 504’s bilateral trade limitations (see <a href="#265">FAQ 265</a>). [2-6-2013]</p> <p>259.
 What can a foreign financial institution (FFI) do with the funds 
resulting from the import of Iranian-origin goods or services once the 
funds are credited to an account? Can funds be transferred to other 
accounts?</p> <p>Section 504 of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr_1905_pl_112_158.pdf">the TRA </a>requires
 that, in order for a sanctionable transaction to fall within the bounds
 of the significant reduction exception, any funds owed to Iran as a 
result of the bilateral trade transaction must be credited to an 
“account located in the country with primary jurisdiction over the [<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1308&amp;rgn=div8">FFI</a>].”
 For purposes of implementing this requirement, OFAC interprets the 
“account located in the country with primary jurisdiction over the 
[FFI]” to be an account in the country with primary jurisdiction over 
the FFI, and at the same FFI that facilitated the transaction for the 
importation of goods or services from Iran.</p> <p>Once the funds are deposited in the FFI, they can be -</p> <p>(i)
 used to pay for a purchase by Iran of goods or services originating in 
the country with primary jurisdiction over the FFI which are exported 
and sold directly to Iran, or for the Humanitarian Exception (see Figure
 1); or </p><p>(ii) transferred to a SPECIAL PURPOSE ACCOUNT (see <a href="#260">FAQ 260</a>)
 within that same FFI, in the country with primary jurisdiction over the
 FFI, where the funds may be later debited to purchase goods or services
 originating in the country with primary jurisdiction over the FFI which
 are exported and sold directly to Iran, or for the Humanitarian 
Exception (see Figure 2). </p><p></p> <p>The funds may not be repatriated to Iran. [2-6-2013] </p> <p>260.
 What is a SPECIAL PURPOSE ACCOUNT for purposes of the National Defenese
 Authorization Act's (NDAA) significant reduction exception? </p> <p>A 
SPECIAL PURPOSE ACCOUNT is an account set up with conditions and 
safeguards that require the account to be used only for bilateral trade 
in goods or services between Iran and the country with primary 
jurisdiction over the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1308&amp;rgn=div8">FFI</a>, and for sales made under the Humanitarian Exception (see <a href="#265">FAQ 265</a>).
 Funds paid as a result of bilateral trade under the NDAA’s significant 
reduction exception may be transferred to a SPECIAL PURPOSE ACCOUNT, so 
long as the account is at the same FFI that facilitated or conducted the
 original transaction, in the country with primary jurisdiction over the
 FFI. [2-6-2013]</p> <p>261. Are there any circumstances in which funds can be transferred to third-country financial institutions? </p> <p>Transfers
 on or after February 6, 2013, of funds deposited in the RECIPIENT 
ACCOUNT or the SPECIAL PURPOSE ACCOUNT to third-country financial 
institutions are not covered by the National Defense Authorization Act's

the Humanitarian Exception. Cash withdrawals from the RECIPIENT ACCOUNT

 Can an exporter of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical

third-country? Can the third-country exporter’s bank handle this 
transaction?</p> <p>Yes. So long as the transaction does not involve a 
designated individual or entity, banks on the Part 561 List located on 
OFAC’s website (<a href="http://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/561list.pdf">http://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/561list.pdf</a>),

 under U.S. law. Furthermore, there is no requirement under U.S. law 
that agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical devices be 
routed through the country with the significant reduction exception.</p> <p>Such
 a payment mechanism is not the exclusive mechanism for the purchase of 
agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical devices under U.S.

 Does the November 8, 2012 designation of National Iranian Oil Company 
(NIOC) under E.O. 13382 impact the scope of permissible transactions by 
foreign financial institutions (FFIs) in significantly reducing 
countries?</p> <p>Yes. On September 24, 2012, NIOC was identified as an 
agent or affiliate of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (“IRGC”) 
under section 312 of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr_1905_pl_112_158.pdf">the TRA </a>, and designated on November 8, 2012, under E.O. 13382 for providing services and support to the IRGC. Accordingly, <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Documents/hr2194.pdf">the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act</a>
 (CISADA) applies to transactions with NIOC. As a result of these 
additional sanctions against NIOC, only transactions solely for the 
purchase of petroleum or petroleum products from NIOC will fall within 
the scope of the significant reduction exception. A <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1308&amp;rgn=div8">FFI</a>

What is the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 (IFCA)?</p> <p><a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/pl112_239.pdf">IFCA </a>was
 signed into law on January 2, 2013, as a part of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, and provides for several new 
sanctions related to Iran. IFCA authorizes broad sanctions on: certain 
activities related to Iran’s energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors;
 the sale, supply, or transfer to or from Iran of precious and certain 
other metals, graphite, coal, and industrial software; the provision of 
underwriting services, insurance, or reinsurance to activities and 
persons targeted by U.S. sanctions against Iran; financial transactions 
involving sanctioned Iranian individuals and entities; and persons 
involved in the diversion of goods intended for the Iranian people. Most
 of the IFCA provisions target conduct occurring on or after July 1, 
2013.</p> <p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury will be issuing 
regulations to implement certain provisions in IFCA. In addition, the 
U.S. Department of State expects to adopt an interpretation of IFCA 
similar to that set forth below. [06-03-13]</p><p></p> <p></p><p>289. 
How will the following Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA)
 terms be interpreted: “Iran,” “knowingly,” “significant,” and 
“transfer”? </p> <p>As a general matter, we intend to rely, where applicable, on definitions of terms previously included in Treasury regulations.</p> <p>“Iran”</p> <p>The Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=e3c4494665db57ce61ce4c1445726e8e&amp;mc=true&amp;r=PART&amp;n=pt31.3.561">31 CFR part 561</a>)
 (IFSR) define “Iran” as the Government of Iran and the territory of 
Iran and any other territory or marine area, including the exclusive 
economic zone and continental shelf, over which the Government of Iran 
claims sovereignty, sovereign rights, or jurisdiction, provided that the
 Government of Iran exercises partial or total de facto control over the
 area or derives a benefit from economic activity in the area pursuant 
to international arrangements. (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=e3c4494665db57ce61ce4c1445726e8e&amp;mc=true&amp;r=PART&amp;n=pt31.3.561#se31.3.561_1329">31 CFR § 561.329</a>)</p> <p>“knowingly”</p> <p>The
 IFSR define “knowingly” with respect to conduct, a circumstance, or a 
result, to mean that a person has actual knowledge, or should have 
known, of the conduct, the circumstance, or the result. (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=e3c4494665db57ce61ce4c1445726e8e&amp;mc=true&amp;r=PART&amp;n=pt31.3.561#se31.3.561_1314">31 CFR § 561.314</a>)</p> <p>“significant” </p> <p>As
 a general matter, in determining for purposes of IFCA and relevant 
Executive orders whether transactions, financial transactions, or 
financial services are significant, the Department of the Treasury will 
rely on the interpretation set out in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=e3c4494665db57ce61ce4c1445726e8e&amp;mc=true&amp;r=PART&amp;n=pt31.3.561#se31.3.561_1404">§561.404 </a>of
 the IFSR. The IFSR provide that the Department of the Treasury may 
consider the totality of the facts and circumstances set forth a list of
 broad factors that can play a role in the determination whether 
transactions, financial services, and financial transactions are 
significant, including: (a) the size, number, and frequency of the 
transactions, financial services, or financial transactions; (b) the 
natureof the transactions, financial services, or financial 
transactions, including their type, complexity, and commercial purpose; 
(c) the level of awareness of management and whether the transactions 
are part of a pattern of conduct; (d) the nexus of the transactions, 
financial services, and financial transactions and blocked persons; (e) 
the impact of the transactions, financial services, and financial 
transactions on statutory objectives; (f) whether the transactions, 
financial services, and financial transactions involve deceptive 
practices; (g) whether the transactions solely involve the passive 
holdings of Central Bank of Iran (CBI) reserves or repayment by the CBI 
of official development assistance or the transfer of funds required as a
 condition of Iran’s membership in an international financial 
institution; and (h) other relevant factors that the Secretary of the 
Treasury deems relevant. We anticipate adopting a similar approach to 
interpreting the term “significant” as it applies to goods or services. (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=e3c4494665db57ce61ce4c1445726e8e&amp;mc=true&amp;r=PART&amp;n=pt31.3.561#se31.3.561_1404">31 C.F.R. §561.404</a>) </p> <p>“transfer” </p> <p>We
 anticipate that regulations to be promulgated will define “transfer” to
 include import, transshipment, export, or reexport, whether direct or 
indirect. [08-06-18]</p> <p>290. Are payments or deliveries that are 
made on or after July 1, 2013, for contracts that existed prior to July 
1, 2013, exempted from IFCA provisions? </p> <p>There is no general 
exception for payments, sales, deliveries, or transfers arising out of 
contracts entered into prior to July 1, 2013, on or after which date 
certain activities become sanctionable under <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/pl112_239.pdf">IFCA </a>.
 The assessment of whether such payments are “significant” or result in 
the transfer of “significant goods or services” or “significant 
financial support” will be done on a case-by-case basis in line with the
 criteria discussed above. [06-03-13]</p> <p>292. What are the implications of IFCA on the provision of humanitarian goods to the people of Iran? </p> <p><a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/pl112_239.pdf">IFCA</a>

What will the “energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors of Iran” mean for the purposes of IFCA?</p> <p>We
 anticipate that regulations to be promulgated will define “energy 
sector of Iran” to include activities involving the exploration, 
extraction, production, refinement, or liquefaction of petroleum, 
natural gas, or petroleum products in Iran. (See also discussion of 
activities involving natural gas in Q&amp;A <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#297">297</a>.) </p> <p>We
 anticipate that regulations to be promulgated will define “shipping 
sector of Iran” to include activities involving the transportation of 
goods by seagoing vessels, including oil tankers and cargo vessels, 
flying the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran, or owned, controlled, 
chartered, or operated directly or indirectly by the Government of Iran.</p> <p>We
 anticipate that regulations to be promulgated will define “shipbuilding
 sector of Iran” to include activities involving the construction of 
seagoing vessels, including oil tankers and cargo vessels, in Iran. 
[08-06-18]</p> <p>294. How will I know if someone is part of Iran’s energy, shipping, or shipbuilding sectors or is a port operator in Iran?</p> <p>Persons determined to be part of Iran’s energy, shipping, or shipbuilding sectors, or a port operator in Iran for purposes of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/pl112_239.pdf">IFCA</a> section 1244(c) will be identified as such on the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/sdn_data.aspx">SDN List</a>.
 Knowingly providing certain significant support to persons determined 
to be part of Iran’s energy, shipping, or shipbuilding sectors, or a 
port operator in Iran will have exposure to sanctions, unless the 
transaction is excepted (see also Q&amp;A <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#297">297</a>). [06-03-13]</p> <p>295.
 What are goods or services used in connection with Iran’s energy, 
shipping, or shipbuilding sectors for purposes of IFCA section 
1244(d)(3)?</p> <p>We anticipate that regulations to be promulgated will
 define goods and services used in connection with Iran’s energy, 
shipping and shipbuilding sectors to include:</p> <p>a. Energy Sector: In the case of Iran’s energy sector, goods or services that contribute to, </p> <ul>
<li><p>Iran’s ability to develop its domestic petroleum resources; </p></li> <li><p>The maintenance or expansion of Iran’s domestic production of petroleum products; and </p></li> <li><p>Iran’s ability to import or export petroleum or petroleum products.</p></li>
</ul> <p>b. Shipping Sector: In the case of Iran’s shipping sector, </p> <ul>
<li><p>The provision of crude and product tankers to Iran; </p></li> <li><p>The provision of registry, flagging, or classification services of any kind; </p></li> <li><p>The supervision of and participation in the repair of ships and their parts; </p></li> <li><p>The inspection, testing, and certification of marine equipment materials and components; </p></li> <li><p>The
 carrying out of surveys, inspections, audits and visits, and the

 other goods or services relating to the maintenance, supply, bunkering,
 and docking of vessels flying the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran,
 or owned, controlled, chartered, or operated directly or indirectly by,
 or for or on behalf of the Government of Iran (GOI) or an Iranian 
person.</p></li>
</ul> <p>c. Shipbuilding Sector: In the case of Iran’s shipbuilding sector, </p> <ul>
<li><p>The building and refit of vessels; </p></li> <li><p>The provision
 or refit of items such as (i) steam turbines and their parts for marine
 propulsions, (ii) marine propulsion engines and parts used solely or 
principally with them, (iii) other gas turbines for marine propulsion, 
(iv) ship or boat propellers and blades, and (v) direction finding 
compasses and other navigational instruments and appliances solely for 
the maritime industry; </p></li> <li><p>Other goods used in connection with building and propulsion of vessels; and </p></li> <li><p>Technical assistance and training relating to, and financing of, the building, maintenance or re-fitting of vessels. </p></li>
</ul> <p>Sections 1244(d)(1) and (2) of <span><a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/pl112_239.pdf">IFCA</a> </span>make
 sanctionable certain transactions for the sale, supply, or transfer to 
or from Iran of such goods and services if they are significant goods or
 services used in connection with Iran’s energy, shipping, or 
shipbuilding sectors. (See Q&amp;A <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#289">289</a>
 above for an interpretation of “significant.”) The provision of goods 
or services identified above could be sanctionable regardless of whether
 any person involved in the transaction has been determined to be part 
of Iran’s energy, shipping, or shipbuilding sectors. [06-03-13] </p> <p>296.
 Will the provision of bunkering services to a non-Iranian vessel 
carrying non-sanctionable goods to or from Iran be subject to sanctions?</p> <p>If
 a non-Iranian vessel is transporting non-sanctionable goods to or from 
Iran, the bunkering of that non-Iranian vessel in a country other than 
Iran — and related payments for these bunkering services — will not be 
subject to sanctions, only if (1) the transaction either does not 
involve U.S. persons (including U.S. financial institutions) or 
U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities, or the transaction is exempt
 from OFAC regulation or authorized by OFAC if it does involve U.S. 
persons (including U.S. financial institutions) or U.S.-owned or 
-controlled foreign entities, and (2) the transaction does not involve 
persons on OFAC’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked 
Persons (SDN List) that have been designated in connection with Iran’s 
support for international terrorism or proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, including designated Iranian financial institutions or the 
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), or activity that is subject to
 other sanctions authorities. [09-05-2019]</p> <p>691. Will the 
provision of bunkering services to a non-Iranian vessel carrying 
sanctionable goods to or from Iran be subject to sanctions?</p> <p>If a 
non-Iranian vessel is transporting sanctionable goods to or from Iran 
(including, but not limited to, petroleum, petroleum products, or 
petrochemical products from Iran; goods used in connection with the 
automotive sector of Iran; or iron, iron products, aluminum, aluminum 
products, steel, steel products, copper, or copper products from Iran), 
bunkering of that non-Iranian vessel in a country other than Iran — and 
related payments for these bunkering services — risk being subject to 
sanctions unless an applicable waiver or exception applies. For example,
 persons providing bunkering services to a non-Iranian vessel 
transporting petroleum or petroleum products from Iran could be 
designated under subsection 1(a)(ii) of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/13846.pdf">E.O. 13846</a>
 if such activities involve the provision of material support for, or 
goods or services to or in support of, NIOC or NICO. Persons that 
knowingly provide bunkering services to a non-Iranian vessel carrying 
only petroleum or petroleum products from Iran could likewise be 
sanctioned under section 3(a)(ii) of E.O. 13846 if that transaction is 
determined to be a significant transaction for the purchase, 
acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of those items. [09-05-2019]</p> <p>692. Will the provision of bunkering services for an Iranian vessel be subject to sanctions?</p> <p>Section 1244(d)(1) of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/pl112_239.pdf">IFCA</a>
 makes sanctionable knowingly selling, supplying, or transferring to or 
from Iran significant goods or services used in connection with Iran’s 
energy, shipping, or shipbuilding sectors. (See <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#289">FAQ 289</a>
 above for an interpretation of “significant.”) The provision of 
bunkering services to a vessel flying the flag of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, or owned, controlled, chartered, or operated directly or 
indirectly by, for, or on behalf of the Government of Iran (GOI) or an 
Iranian person, could be sanctionable under this authority, regardless 
of whether the transaction involves persons that have been determined to
 be part of Iran’s energy, shipping, or shipbuilding sectors pursuant to
 Section 1244(c) of IFCA. Likewise, pursuant to section 1244(d)(2) of 
IFCA, a foreign financial institution could be exposed to sanctions if 
it knowingly conducts or facilitates a significant financial transaction
 for the sale, supply, or transfer to or from Iran of goods or services 
used in connection with Iran’s energy, shipping, or shipbuilding 
sectors. Payments for the provision of bunkering services to a vessel 
flying the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran or owned, controlled, 
chartered, or operated directly or indirectly by, for, or on behalf of 
the GOI or an Iranian person could be sanctionable under this authority,
 regardless of whether the transaction involves persons that have been 
determined to be part of Iran’s energy, shipping, or shipbuilding 
sectors pursuant to Section 1244(c) of IFCA. (See <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#295">FAQ 295</a>). </p> <p>In
 addition, non-U.S. persons that provide bunkering services for an 
Iranian vessel that has been identified as blocked property of an 
Iranian person on OFAC’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and 
Blocked Persons — or that make related payments for these bunkering 
services — risk being designated themselves​</p> <p>However, the 
provision of bunkering services for an Iranian vessel transporting goods
 subject to an exception, such as agricultural commodities, food, 
medicine, or medical devices, to Iran, or subject to an applicable 
waiver — and the making of related payments for these bunkering services
 — will not be exposed to sanctions, unless the transactions involve 
persons on the SDN List that have been designated under E.O. 13224 or 
E.O. 13382 in connection with Iran’s support for international terrorism
 or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including certain 
designated Iranian financial institutions or the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps (IRGC), as described in section 104(c)(2)(E) of CISADA, or 
activity that is subject to other sanctions authorities. [09-05-2019]</p> <p>297. Are there any exceptions to the sanctions provisions of section 1244 of IFCA? </p> <p>The following transactions are excepted from the provisions of section 1244 of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/pl112_239.pdf">IFCA</a>.</p> <p>a.
 Transactions for the sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, 
or medical devices to Iran or for the provision of humanitarian

A significant financial transaction conducted or facilitated by a foreign financial institution (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f001609e54e2c4adcbab5dafe63ba4a7&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1308&amp;rgn=div8">FFI</a>),
 provided that a significant reduction exception under 1245(d)(4)(D)(i) 
of NDAA 2012 applies to the country with primary jurisdiction over the 
FFI and the financial transaction is for trade in goods or services (i) 
between Iran and the country with primary jurisdiction over the FFI and 
(ii) not otherwise subject to sanctions under the law of the United 
States, and any funds owed to Iran as a result of the trade are credited
 to an account located in the country with primary jurisdiction over the
 FFI. We anticipate the implementation of these trade requirements to be
 similar to the trade requirements set forth in the Iranian Financial 
Sanctions Regulations (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c3eb48678bdb23e3700a21b7cba1d7cb&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr561_main_02.tpl">IFSR</a>), in particular <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c3eb48678bdb23e3700a21b7cba1d7cb&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1203&amp;rgn=div8">31 CFR §561.203</a>(j) and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c3eb48678bdb23e3700a21b7cba1d7cb&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se31.3.561_1203&amp;rgn=div8">31 CFR §561.203</a>(k). </p> <p>d. The sale, supply, or transfer of natural gas to or from Iran. <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/pl112_239.pdf">IFCA</a>
 section 1244, however, does set out sanctions that may apply to FFIs 
that conduct or facilitate a transaction for the sale, supply, or 
transfer of natural gas to or from Iran unless the financial transaction
 is for trade in goods or services (i) between Iran and the country with
 primary jurisdiction over the FFI and (ii) not otherwise subject to 
sanctions under the law of the United States, and any funds owed to Iran
 as a result of the trade are credited to an account located in the 
country with primary jurisdiction over the FFI. We anticipate the 
implementation of these trade requirements to be similar to the trade 
requirements set forth in the IFSR, in particular 31 CFR §561.203(j) and
 31 CFR §561.203(k).</p> <p>e. Certain activities relating to the 
pipeline project to supply natural gas from the Shah Deniz gas field in 
Azerbaijan to Europe and Turkey. [08-06-18]</p> <p>315. Will routine 
payments or fees be subject to sanctions if they are made to a person 
determined to be a port operator in Iran and if the vessel is carrying 
non-sanctioned goods?</p> <p>Any company involved in loading or 
unloading cargo in Iran should exercise great caution to avoid engaging 
in transactions with entities designated by the United States, including
 the Tidewater Middle East Co. which was designated for its involvement 
in Iran’s proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. However, to the 
extent that a shipping company transacts with port operators in Iran 
that have been identified as such under <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/pl112_239.pdf">IFCA</a>
 but not otherwise designated, and as long as such payments are limited 
strictly to routine fees including port dues, docking fees, or cargo 
handling fees, paid for the loading and unloading of non-sanctioned 
goods at Iranian ports, we anticipate that such transactions would not 
be considered significant transactions for the purposes of IFCA. 
Non-routine and/or large payments or fees that materially exceed 
standard industry rates could expose a person to sanctions. Furthermore,
 providing any port operator in Iran with any significant financial, 
material, technological, or other support could expose a person to 
sanctions.

international terrorism or WMD proliferation, or for activities with 
respect to Iran for which sanctions have been imposed (e.g., knowingly 
engaging in a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, 
sale, transport, or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from 
Iran). However, the provision of insurance, reinsurance, or underwriting
 services to non-Iranian persons on the SDN List is generally not 
sanctionable under section 1246(a)(1) of IFCA if the provision of

 be authorized under the medicine and medical devices general license to
 arrange for the reexport to Iran of EAR99 medicines, as well as the 
export to Iran of medicines not subject to the EAR (e.g., medicines

exportation or reexportation of any agricultural commodities to Iranian 
military, intelligence, or law enforcement purchasers or importers, must
 still apply for a specific license from OFAC. </p> <p>The agricultural 
commodities general license in the ITSR also does not authorize exports 
or reexports to persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked under any of the programs administered by OFAC, except for 
persons whose property and interests in property are blocked solely

 except for certain excluded persons as well as certain medical devices 
that are excluded from the authorization and published on the List of 
Medical Devices Requiring Specific Authorization. The exportation and 
reexportation of items on the List of Medical Devices Requiring Specific
 Authorization or to excluded persons requires a specific license from 
OFAC. The amendment also adds shrimp and shrimp eggs to the list of 
agricultural commodities that may be exported to Iran without specific 
authorization, other than to certain excluded persons.</p> <p>In 
addition, the amendment authorizes covered persons to provide training, 
other than to certain excluded persons, necessary and ordinarily 
incident to the safe and effective use of agricultural commodities, 
medicine, and medical devices exported or reexported pursuant to section
 560.530 of the ITSR. It also authorizes the importation into the United
 States of certain U.S.-origin agricultural commodities, medicine, and 
medical devices that were previously exported or reexported to Iran 
pursuant to the authorizations in section 560.530 of the ITSR and that 
are broken, defective, or non-operational, or are connected to product 
recalls, adverse events, or other safety concerns. Additionally, the 
amendment authorizes the exportation or reexportation to Iran, and 
storage within Iran for future use, of a limited number of replacement 
parts for certain medical devices previously exported or reexported to 
Iran pursuant to an OFAC license to replace broken or non-operational 
components or where it is ordinarily incident and necessary to proper 
preventative maintenance of the medical device, and the exportation or 
reexportation of software and services related to the operation, 
maintenance, and repair of medical devices. [12-22-16]</p> <p>483. How 
does an exporter determine which medical devices need to be specifically
 licensed by OFAC for exportation or reexportation to Iran?</p> <p>An exporter should refer to the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_gl_med_supplies.pdf">List of Medical Devices Requiring Specific Authorization</a>, which is maintained on OFAC’s website, <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/ofac">www.treasury.gov/ofac</a>, on the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/iran.aspx">Iran Sanctions page</a>.

See <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_gld1.pdf">GL D-1</a>,
 paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) &amp; (a)(3). The general license now authorizes,
 for example, a U.S. company to export to Iran, from a location outside 
the United States, certain hardware or software that is not subject to 
the EAR (including foreign-origin hardware or software containing less 
than a de minimis amount of U.S. controlled content). See <a href="#342">FAQ #342</a>. </p> <p>Third,
 a new Note has been added to paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) clarifying 
that the authorization in those paragraphs includes the exportation, 
reexportation, or provision, directly or indirectly, of the authorized 
items by an individual leaving the United States for Iran. GL D-1 also 
adds a new authorization for the importation by an individual into the 
United States of certain hardware and software previously exported by 
the individual to Iran pursuant to other provisions of GL D-1 or 31 
C.F.R. § 560.540. See <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_gld1.pdf">GL D-1</a>,
 paragraph (a)(5). The general license now authorizes, for example, an 
individual to carry a smartphone that falls within the scope of the GL 
D-1 authorization while traveling to and from Iran. See <a href="#343">FAQ #343</a>.</p> <p>Finally,
 to further ensure that the sanctions on Iran do not have an unintended 
chilling effect on the willingness of companies to make available 
certain publicly available, no cost personal communications tools to 
persons in that country, GL D-1 adds a new authorization related to the 
potential recipients of certain publicly available, no cost services and
 software. See <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_gld1.pdf">GL D-1</a>, paragraph (a)(6).</p> <p>Notwithstanding

from compliance with the export license requirements of another Federal 
agency. [02-07-2014]</p> <p>338. With respect to GL D-1 authorizations in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), what services and software are covered?</p> <p>Qualifying
 services or software must be “incident to the exchange of personal

under paragraph (a)(2) must meet the stated export control-related 
criteria. Both paragraphs provide an illustrative but not exhaustive 
list of the types of services that are authorized: “instant messaging, 
chat and email, social networking, sharing of photos and movies, web 
browsing, and blogging.” See <a href="#344">FAQ #344</a> and OFAC’s Interpretive Guidance and Statement of Licensing Policy on Internet Freedom in Iran (March 20, 2012), available at <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/internet_freedom.pdf">http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/internet_freedom.pdf.</a></p> <p>Qualifying

and E.O. 13645 of June 3, 2013, that had been revoked by E.O. 13716 of 
January 16, 2016. Consistent with <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/jcpoa_winddown_faqs.pdf">guidance issued by the Department of the Treasury on May 8, 2018</a>
 , E.O. 13846 reimposes specified sanctions relating to Iran following 
relevant wind-down periods, i.e., on or after August 7, 2018 or November
 5, 2018, depending on the activity involved. In addition, to provide 
clarity and consolidate relevant authorities into a single E.O., E.O. 
13846 revokes E.O.s 13716 and 13628 and continues in effect sanctions 
authorities provided for in those E.O.s. E.O. 13846 also broadens the

 anticipate that forthcoming regulations will define “goods or services

 does not make sanctionable the export of finished vehicles to Iran if 
no further assembly or manufacturing is required. As such, exporting 
fully assembled and finished vehicles to Iran for sale would not be 
sanctionable, so long as the transaction is consistent with U.S. 
sanctions, including that it does not involve a sanctioned person. </p> <p>In
 contrast, “auto kits” (or “knock-down kits”) exported to Iran for 
assembly in Iran would be considered goods or services used in 
connection with the automotive sector of Iran and the export of such 
kits to Iran would be sanctionable if the transaction is “significant.”

sanctionable. However, the export, sale, or distribution of goods (e.g.,
 auto parts and accessories) or services that would contribute to Iran’s
 ability to manufacture or assemble vehicles, or manufacture original 
equipment and after-market parts in Iran, could create exposure to 
sanctions. Persons exporting parts and services to Iran for the 
maintenance or upkeep of finished automobiles, and FFIs facilitating 
such exports, should exercise caution to ensure that the parts or 
services are not diverted for the manufacturing or assembly of vehicles 
in Iran or the manufacturing of original equipment or after-market parts
 in Iran, and are used only for maintenance and upkeep. [08-06-2018] </p> <p></p><p>Sanctions on Petroleum-related Transactions </p> <p>614.

 reimposes sanctions previously set out in E.O.s 13622, 13628, and 13645
 with respect to the Iranian energy, petroleum, and petrochemical 
sectors. As such, subsections 1(a)(ii) and (2)(a)(ii) of E.O. 13846 
authorize blocking sanctions and correspondent or payable-through 
account sanctions on persons providing material support for, or goods or
 services to, NIOC or NICO. Separately, subsection 2(a)(iii) of E.O. 
13846 authorizes the imposition of correspondent or payable-through 
account sanctions on an FFI determined to have knowingly conducted or 
facilitated any significant financial transaction with NIOC or NICO 
(except for sales of refined petroleum products to NIOC or NICO that are
 below the dollar threshold that could trigger sanctions under section 
5(a)(3)(A)(i) of ISA). Subsections 2(a)(iv)-(a)(v) provide authority to 
impose sanctions on FFIs determined to have knowingly conducted or 
facilitated a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, 
sale, transport, or marketing of petroleum, petroleum products, or 
petrochemicals from Iran, with the aim of deterring Iran or any other 
country or institution from establishing workaround payment mechanisms 
for the purchase of Iranian oil to circumvent the NDAA 2012 oil 
sanctions. Subsections 3(a)(ii)-(a)(iii) provide authority to impose 
menu-based sanctions or persons determined to have engaged in a 
significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, 
or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran. Furthermore, 
persons that sell, supply, or transfer to or from Iran significant goods
 or services used in connection with Iran’s energy sector are exposed to
 menu-based sanctions pursuant to subsection 1244(d) of IFCA and section
 5 of E.O. 13846 The existing exception rules under NDAA 2012 apply to 
these sanctions. Thus, countries that are determined by the Secretary of

 Does E.O. 13846 mean that Iran’s trade partners should no longer buy 
petroleum products from Iran? How will this affect exports of Iranian 
oil?</p> <p>These measures, which apply to transactions occurring on or 
after November 5, 2018, establish a key element of the comprehensive 
Iran sanctions framework by deterring work-around financial transactions
 involving NIOC or NICO that were not being captured under the sanctions
 previously implemented against the CBI at the time E.O. 13622 was 
issued. Iranian trade partners can continue to buy petroleum and 
petroleum products from Iran without risking sanctions under <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/13846.pdf">E.O. 13846</a>
 if they receive a significant reduction exception under relevant 
provisions of the NDAA 2012 for the relevant period. However, E.O. 13846
 provides authority to sanction, on or after November 5, 2018, the 
purchase of petroleum or petroleum products and significant dealings 
with NIOC or NICO by persons in jurisdictions that do not have a 
significant reduction exception. In addition, IFCA provides for 
sanctions on persons determined to be part of the energy sector of Iran,
 or to sell, supply, or transfer to or from Iran significant goods or 
services used in connection with the energy sector of Iran, provided the
 person is not in a jurisdiction that has received a significant 
reduction exception. (See <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#293">FAQs 293-297</a> relating to IFCA.) [08-06-2018]</p> <p>616.
 Can countries that receive a significant reduction exception under NDAA

 reestablishes the authority previously contained in E.O. 13622 to 
sanction FFIs that, on or after November 5, 2018, knowingly conduct or 
facilitate any significant transaction with NIOC or NICO. Financial 
institutions in jurisdictions that have received a significant reduction
 exception are not subject to these sanctions for transactions with NIOC
 and NICO for the purchase of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran 
while the exception applies. In addition, IFCA provides for sanctions on
 persons that knowingly provide significant financial, material, 
technological, or other support to, or goods or services in support of 
any activity or transaction on behalf of or for the benefit of an 
Iranian person on the SDN List (other than non-designated Iranian 
financial institutions), provided the person is not in a jurisdiction

 Are barter arrangements or other non-cash trade transactions involving 
petroleum, petroleum products, or petrochemical products originating

 for a barter arrangement, on or after November 5, 2018, related to the 
purchase or acquisition of petroleum, petroleum products, or 
petrochemical products from Iran. In addition, barter transactions 
knowingly conducted with NIOC, NICO, or the CBI also could result in

[08-06-2018]</p> <p>623. Is there a wind-down or safe harbor provision for Section 8 of E.O. 13846? </p> <p>No. Section 8 of <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/13846.pdf">E.O. 13846</a>
 continues in effect the prohibition previously contained in section 4 
of E.O. 13628, which — consistent with subsection 218(d) of the TRA — 
provided that civil penalties would not apply if a U.S. person that owns
 or controls the foreign entity divested or terminated its business with
 the U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entity not later than February 6,
 2013. Because the relevant prohibition came into effect more than five 
years ago and a wind-down period was provided at that time, Section 8 of
 E.O. 13846 does not include such a wind-down authorization.</p> <p>Please
 note, however, that section 560.537 of the ITSR authorizes — through 
11:59 p.m. EST on November 4, 2018 — all transactions and activities 
ordinarily incident and necessary to the wind down of activities that 
had been authorized under the now-revoked Iran General License H. To the
 extent a U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entity or a U.S. person is 
engaging in wind-down activities pursuant to section 560.537 of the 
ITSR, those activities should be completed prior to the general 
license’s expiration at 11:59 p.m. EST on November 4, 2018. [08-06-2018]

 provides authority to block the property and interests in property of 
persons determined, on or after November 5, 2018, to have materially 
assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological 
support for, or goods or services to or in support of: (A) Iranian 
persons included on the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx">SDN List</a>
 or (B) any other persons included on the SDN List whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13599 or 
subsection 1(a) of E.O. 13846 (in both cases excluding Iranian 
depository institutions whose property and interests in property are 
blocked solely pursuant to Executive Order 13599). Certain activities 
relating to the pipeline project to supply natural gas from the Shah 
Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan to Europe and Turkey are excepted from 
this provision. </p> <p>In implementing this provision, the United

 wind-down period has ended and the United States intends to fully 
enforce the sanctions that have come back into effect. The provision or 
delivery of goods or services and/or the extension of additional loans 
or credits to an Iranian counterparty after November 4, 2018 — even 
pursuant to written contracts or written agreements entered into prior 
to May 8, 2018 — may result in the imposition of U.S. sanctions unless 
such activities are exempt from regulation, authorized by OFAC, or 
otherwise not sanctionable.</span></p> <p><span>The United States 
maintains authorizations and exceptions under U.S. sanctions that allow 
for the sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, and medical 
devices to Iran by U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons. However, these 
authorizations and exceptions do not apply to transactions involving 
persons on OFAC’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked 
Persons (SDN List) that have been designated in connection with Iran’s 
support for international terrorism or proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, including designated Iranian financial institutions or the 
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), or activity that is subject to
 other sanctions (see <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#637"><span>FAQ </span><span>637</span></a>). [11-05-2018]</span></p> <p> <span>631.
 I was not able to receive payment for goods or services fully provided 
or delivered prior to the end of the wind-down period. How should I 
proceed? </span></p> <p><span>In the event that a non-U.S., non-Iranian 
person is owed payment after the conclusion of the wind-down period on 
August 6, 2018, or November 4, 2018, as applicable, for goods or 
services fully provided or delivered to an Iranian counterparty prior to
 August 6, 2018, or November 4, 2018, as applicable, pursuant to a 
written contract or written agreement entered into prior to May 8, 2018,
 and such activities were consistent with U.S. sanctions in effect at 
the time of delivery or provision, the U.S. government would allow the 
non-U.S., non-Iranian person to receive payment for those goods or 
services according to the terms of the written contract or written 
agreement. Similarly, if a non-U.S., non-Iranian person is owed 
repayment after August 6, 2018, or November 4, 2018, as applicable, for 
loans or credits extended to an Iranian counterparty prior to the end of
 the 90-day or 180- day wind-down period, as applicable, provided that 
such loans or credits were extended pursuant to a written contract or 
written agreement entered into prior to May 8, 2018, and such activities
 were consistent with U.S. sanctions in effect at the time the loans or 
credits were extended, the U.S. government would allow the non-U.S., 
non-Iranian person to receive repayment of the related debt or 
obligation according to the terms of the written contract or written 
agreement. This allowance is designed for non-U.S., non-Iranian parties 
to be made whole for debts and obligations owed or due to them for goods
 or services fully provided or delivered or loans or credit extended to 
an Iranian party prior to the end of the 90-day or 180-day wind-down 
period, as applicable. Any payments would need to be consistent with 
U.S. sanctions, including that payments could not involve U.S. persons 
or the U.S. financial system, unless the transactions are exempt from 
regulation or authorized by OFAC (see <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#634"><span>FAQ </span><span>634</span></a> and <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#636"><span>FAQ </span><span>636</span></a>). </span></p> <p><span>The U.S. government would evaluate matters falling outside the above parameters on a case-by-case basis.

 Will the U.S. government provide assurances beyond the guidance 
described in 631 and 634 that receipt of payment by non-U.S., 
non-Iranian persons is not sanctionable?</span></p> <p><span>OFAC 
encourages non-U.S., non-Iranian persons to rely on the guidance 
provided in FAQs 631 and 634. Non-U.S., non-Iranian persons can seek 
guidance from OFAC or the State Department, as appropriate, prior to the
 receipt of payment, if they would like to confirm that the payments 
would meet the criteria set forth in <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#631"><span>FAQ </span><span>631</span></a> and <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#634"><span>FAQ </span><span>634</span></a> and would not be subject to U.S. sanctions.

 Under what circumstances are goods or services considered “fully 
provided or delivered” prior to the expiration of the relevant wind-down
 period, as referenced in FAQ 631 above? </span></p> <p><span>OFAC looks
 to the industry standard to determine whether particular goods or 
services are considered fully provided or delivered prior to the 
expiration of the relevant wind-down period. As a general matter, goods 
or services will be considered fully provided or delivered when the 
party providing or delivering the goods or services has performed all 
the actions and satisfied all the obligations necessary to be eligible 
for payment or other agreed-to compensation. With respect to goods 
exported to or from Iran, at a minimum, title to the goods must have 
transferred to the relevant party. [08-06-2018] </span></p> <p> <span>634.
 Can I, as a non-U.S., non-Iranian person, receive payments after the 
relevant wind-down period ends for goods or services that were fully 
provided or delivered during the relevant wind-down period pursuant to 
contracts entered into prior to May 8, 2018? </span></p> <p><span>Yes, 
subject to the conditions set out below and in FAQ 631 above, non-U.S., 
non-Iranian persons may receive payment after the end of the relevant 
wind-down period for goods or services fully provided or delivered to an
 Iranian counterparty prior to expiration of the relevant wind-down 
period (see FAQ 633 above). In particular, the goods or services must 
have been fully provided or delivered prior to the end of the applicable
 wind-down period pursuant to a written contract or written agreement 
entered into prior to May 8, 2018; the relevant activities must have 
been consistent with U.S. sanctions in effect at the time of delivery or
 provision, including that the activities did not involve persons on the
 SDN List at the time of the transaction; and any payments must be 
consistent with U.S. sanctions, including that payments can not involve 
U.S. persons or the U.S. financial system, unless the transactions are 
exempt from regulation or authorized by OFAC (see <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#631"><span>FAQ </span><span>631</span></a> and <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#636"><span>FAQ </span><span>636</span></a>).

 Can I, as a U.S. person or U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entity, 
receive payments after the relevant wind-down period ends for goods or 
services that were fully provided or delivered during the relevant 
wind-down period under an OFAC wind-down authorization and pursuant to a
 contract entered into prior to May 8, 2018? </span></p> <p><span>The 
wind-down authorizations allow U.S. persons and U.S.-owned or 
-controlled foreign entities to receive payments for activities 
conducted pursuant to such wind-down authorizations only during their 
validity periods. For example, a U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign 
entity may receive payment through 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on 
November 4, 2018 for Iran-related activities undertaken pursuant to 
section 560.537 of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations 
(ITSR) (winding down of transactions relating to U.S.-owned or 
-controlled foreign entities). </span></p> <p><span>Any payment 
following the end of the relevant wind-down period for activities 
undertaken pursuant to a wind-down authorization, including from an 
Iranian counterparty, would require specific authorization from OFAC. 
OFAC will evaluate such requests for specific licenses on a case-by-case
 basis. </span></p> <p><span>Any request for a specific license should 
provide sufficient details for OFAC to evaluate the application, 
including: whether the relevant transactions complied with U.S. 
sanctions as in effect at the time of the transactions; whether the 
activities were performed under a written contract or written agreement 
entered into prior to May 8, 2018; and why the applicant was unable to 
receive the payment for which authorization is sought prior to the end 
of the relevant wind-down period. OFAC will generally deny requests to 
receive payment for activities that were not authorized under the 
relevant wind-down authorizations or that were not undertaken pursuant 
to a written contract or written agreement entered into prior to May 8, 
2018. </span></p> <p><span>As required by 31 C.F.R. section 501.801(b), 
applicants should identify the names of all parties who are concerned 
with or interested in the proposed transaction. To facilitate OFAC’s 
review, the request should also include a description of the efforts 
that were undertaken to collect the payment during the relevant 
wind-down period and be accompanied by supporting documentation, 
including relevant contracts, invoices, and shipping documents. OFAC 
encourages applicants to submit applications online (link available <span><a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Pages/licensing.aspx">here</a></span>). [11-05-2018]</span></p> <p> <span>636.
 Can I receive payment for activities undertaken during the wind-down 
period if the payment involves a person that has been added to the SDN 
List, including a person that was previously on the List of Persons 
Blocked Solely Pursuant to E.O. 13599 (the “E.O. 13599 List”) but is now
 designated under another authority?</span></p> <p><span>The United 
States intends to fully enforce the sanctions that apply to persons that
 were previously on the E.O. 13599 List but that are now designated 
under another authority. </span></p> <p><span>U.S. persons and 
U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities generally would require an 
OFAC authorization to receive any payment involving an SDN, regardless 
of whether they were previously on the E.O.13599 List. OFAC will 
evaluate requests for such authorization on a case-by-case basis, 
including whether payments are for goods or services fully provided or 
delivered during the wind-down period pursuant to an OFAC wind-down 
authorization (see <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#635"><span>FAQ </span><span>635</span></a>). </span></p> <p><span>Non-U.S.
 persons, including foreign financial institutions, could be subject to 
sanctions for knowingly engaging in certain significant transactions 
involving an Iranian person on the SDN List – other than a 
non-designated Iranian financial institution – or a person designated in
 connection with Iran’s support for international terrorism or 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including a person that 
was previously on the E.O. 13599 List but is now designated under 
another authority. Such persons will have a notation of “Additional 
Sanctions Information – Subject to Secondary Sanctions” in their SDN 
List entry in addition to the tag for the other sanctions program(s) 
(e.g., the “[SDGT]” tag, the “[IRAN-HR]” tag, or the “[NPWMD]” tag for 
persons designated under E.O. 13224, E.O. 13553, or E.O. 13382).</span></p> <p><span>Non-U.S.,
 non-Iranian persons seeking to receive payment for activities 
undertaken during the wind-down period that involves a person added to 
the SDN List should seek guidance from OFAC or the State Department, as 
appropriate (see <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#634"><span>FAQ </span><span>634</span></a>). [11-05-2018]</span></p> <p><span>637.
 Is it sanctionable for non-U.S., non-Iranian persons to engage in 
transactions related to the provision of humanitarian and consumer goods
 to Iran? </span></p> <p><span>The United States maintains broad 
authorizations and exceptions under U.S. sanctions that allow for the 
sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, and medical devices to
 Iran from the United States or by U.S. persons or U.S.-owned or 
-controlled foreign entities. U.S. sanctions laws provide similar 
allowances for sales of food, agricultural commodities, medicine, and 
medical devices to Iran by non-U.S. persons. Broadly speaking, 
transactions for the sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, 
or medical devices to Iran are not sanctionable unless they involve 
persons on the SDN List that have been designated in connection with 
Iran’s support for international terrorism or proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction, including designated Iranian financial institutions
 or the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), or activity that is 
subject to other sanctions. Additional guidance relating to these 
authorizations and exceptions can be found on the OFAC website <span><a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_guidance_med.pdf">here</a></span> and <span><a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/hum_exp_iran.pdf">here</a></span>. </span></p> <p><span>Transactions
 by non-U.S. persons related to the export to Iran of consumer goods 
that do not fall within these exceptions, but are not expressly targeted
 by U.S. sanctions, should not involve certain persons on the SDN List, 
including the Central Bank of Iran or a designated Iranian financial 
institution, unless an exception under Section 1245(d)(4)(D) of the 
National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2012 (NDAA 2012) 
applies, or the IRGC. In addition, such transactions should not involve 
U.S. persons or transit the U.S. financial system, unless the activities
 and/or transactions are exempt from regulation or authorized by OFAC. 
[11-05-2018]</span></p> <p> <span>638. What happened to the E.O. 13599 List?</span></p> <p><span>The
 E.O. 13599 List was created to clarify that, regardless of their 
removal from the SDN List on January 16, 2016, persons that OFAC had 
previously identified as meeting the definition of the terms “Government
 of Iran” or “Iranian financial institution” still met those definitions
 and continued to be persons whose property and interests in property 
were blocked pursuant to E.O. 13599 and section 560.211 of the ITSR. On 
November 5, 2018, OFAC moved persons identified on the E.O. 13599 List 
to the SDN List and removed the E.O. 13599 List from its website.</span></p> <p><span>Beginning
 on November 5, 2018, significant transactions with persons moved from 
the E.O. 13599 List to the SDN List, other than non-designated Iranian 
financial institutions, could be subject to secondary sanctions, unless 
an exception applies, such as the exception relating to transactions for
 the sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical 
devices to Iran; or the significant reduction exception under Section 
1245(d)(4)(D) of the NDAA 2012. Persons subject to secondary sanctions 
will have a notation of “Additional Sanctions Information – Subject to 
Secondary Sanctions” in the SDN List entry. In addition, effective 
November 5, 2018, OFAC has amended the ITSR to replace references to the
 E.O. 13599 List with references to the SDN List. </span></p> <p><span>Some
 persons moved to the SDN List from the E.O. 13599 List also have been 
designated under additional authorities and, therefore, have received 
new unique identification numbers (UIDs) when added to the SDN List. 
Users of OFAC’s sanctions list data may wish to reference the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Documents/13599_to_sdn_mapping_table.csv">following mapping table</a> to see how these specific records were added back onto the SDN list. [11-05-2018]</span></p> <p> <span>639. <span>Why
 are some persons that had been blocked solely pursuant to E.O. 13599 
now designated pursuant to other authorities, such as E.O. 13224 and 
E.O. 13382?</span></span></p> <p><span>OFAC designated multiple Iranian 
financial institutions and other persons previously blocked solely 
pursuant to E.O. 13599 under E.O. 13224 (relating to counterterrorism), 
E.O. 13382 (relating to WMD proliferation), and E.O. 13553 (relating to 
serious human rights abuses by the Government of Iran) on October 16, 
2018, and November 5, 2018. These included persons that had been removed
 from the SDN List on January 16, 2016. As new information became 
available, OFAC determined that these persons met one or more of the 
criteria for designation under OFAC’s other designation authorities. 
Relatedly, a number of persons that were previously designated pursuant 
to E.O. 13382 and were removed from the SDN List on January 16, 2016 
were relisted on the SDN List on November 5, 2018 as persons identified 
as meeting the definitions of the “Government of Iran” or an “Iranian 
financial institution” pursuant to E.O. 13599. [11-05-2018]</span></p> <p> <span>640. </span><span>What does the <span>November 5, 2018 amendment to the ITSR do?</span></span></p> <p><span>This
 regulatory amendment does two things. First, it amends the ITSR to 
reflect the re-imposition of ITSR-related sanctions lifted under the 
JCPOA, including sanctions pursuant to certain sections of E.O. 13846 
and the relisting on the SDN List of persons included on the E.O. 13599 
List. More specifically, this rule reinstates the regulatory provisions 
implementing the blocking authorities that were previously in sections 5
 and 6 of E.O. 13622 and now are in sections 1 and 10 of E.O. 13846. 
Section 560.211(c) of the ITSR will now implement blocking of the 
property and interests in property of a</span><span>ny person determined
 by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of
 State, to have (i) on or after August 7, 2018, </span><span>materially 
assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological 
support for, or goods or services in support of, the purchase or 
acquisition of U.S. bank notes or precious metals by the Government of 
Iran, or (ii) on or after November 5, 2018, materially assisted, 
sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support 
for, or goods or services in support of, the National Iranian Oil 
Company (NIOC), the Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO), or the Central 
Bank of Iran.</span><span>Additionally, this rule removes references to the E.O. 13599 List to reflect OFAC’s separate action </span><span>removing
 the E.O. 13599 List from its website and relisting on the SDN List the 
persons that were previously listed on the E.O. 13599 List.</span></p> <p><span>Second,
 the rule amends an existing general license in the ITSR to allow 
individual U.S. persons to engage in transactions necessary to sell 
certain personal property in Iran (which was acquired before becoming a 
U.S. person or which was inherited from persons in Iran) and to transfer
 the proceeds of those sales to the United States. Section 560.543 of 
the ITSR currently authorizes individual U.S. persons to engage in 
transactions necessary for the sale of <span>real</span> property in 
Iran and the transfer of related proceeds to the United States, subject 
to a number of conditions and limitations. Authorized transactions 
include engaging the services of any persons in Iran necessary for the 
sale, such as an attorney, funds agent, or real estate broker, provided 
such person is not </span><span>a person whose property and interests in
 property are blocked pursuant to any part of 31 CFR chapter V, other 
than persons whose property and interests in property are blocked solely
 pursuant to Executive Order 13599 as the Government of Iran<span>. OFAC is amending section 560.543 of the ITSR to authorize the sale of <span>personal</span>
 property in Iran and the transfer of related proceeds to the United 
States, subject to the same conditions and limitations applicable to 
sales of real property. </span></span></p> <p><span>Section 560.543 of 
the ITSR, as amended, does not authorize transactions that would be 
prohibited by a different sanctions program administered by OFAC, such 
as transactions with SDNs designated under E.O. 13224 or E.O. 13382 
(OFAC’s counterterrorism or counterproliferation authorities). 
[11-05-2018]</span></p> <p> <span>641. If a country with primary 
jurisdiction over a foreign financial institution did not receive a 
significant reduction exception (SRE) under section 1245(d)(4)(D) of the
 NDAA 2012, can funds currently held at the foreign financial 
institution in that country on behalf of the Central Bank of Iran be 
used to facilitate humanitarian trade with Iran?</span></p> <p><span>Yes.
 Transactions for the sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, 
or medical devices to Iran involving the Central Bank of Iran are 
excepted from the relevant sanctions under section 1245(d)(2) of the 
NDAA 2012 and sections 561.203 and 561.204 of the Iranian Financial 
Sanctions Regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 561) (IFSR), regardless of whether
 the country has received an SRE. In addition, funds held on behalf of a
 non-designated Iranian financial institution at a foreign financial 
institution generally would not be subject to U.S. secondary sanctions 
and could be used to facilitate humanitarian trade. [11-05-2018]</span></p> <p> <span>642. Is the provision of certain associated services relating</span><span> to the purchase of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran by persons in a country that has been granted a SRE sanctionable?</span></p> <p><span>Many
 U.S. sanctions related to Iran include an exception for countries that 
have received a SRE under section 1245(d)(4)(D) of the NDAA 2012 (see <span><a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#tra_504">https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#tra_504</a></span>
 for additional information regarding the implementation of the SRE and 
sanctionable transactions). To the extent the purchase of petroleum or 
petroleum products from Iran and the processing of the related financial
 transactions meet the requirements set out in section 1245(d)(4)(D) of 
the NDAA 2012, the services used to import the petroleum from Iran 
including services provided by the shipping sector of Iran and Iranian 
port operators would not be sanctionable pursuant to the Iran Freedom 
and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 (IFCA), provided that Iranian 
entities that are involved in such transactions are not designated in 
connection with Iran’s support for international terrorism, or its 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery.

 Is payment of Iran-related insurance or reinsurance claims made on or 
after November 5, 2018 sanctionable if the claim arises from an incident
 that occurred prior to November 5, 2018? </span></p> <p><span>Payment 
of Iran-related insurance or reinsurance claims arising from incidents 
that occurred prior to November 5, 2018 could create sanctions exposure 
for non-U.S. persons to the extent such payment involves a person 
designated in connection with Iran’s proliferation of WMD or support for
 international terrorism, or an Iranian person on the SDN List, other 
than a non-designated Iranian financial institution, or if the 
underlying activity involved such persons or was otherwise sanctionable 
at the time it occurred. </span></p> <p><span>U.S. persons continue to 
be generally prohibited under the ITSR from exporting goods, services, 
or technology directly or indirectly to Iran, including participating in
 the payment of claims to or for the benefit of Iran or any persons 
blocked under the ITSR, or for the transportation of Iranian-origin oil,
 unless exempt or specifically authorized by OFAC. In addition, after 
November 4, 2018, to the extent a claim payment involves a U.S.-owned or

controlled by a U.S. person and established or maintained outside the 
United States (a “U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entity”) required to
 apply restrictions akin to blocking on the property or interests in 
property of persons subject to section 560.211 of the ITSR?</span></p> <p><span>Yes.
 Under section 560.215 of the ITSR, U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign 
entities are prohibited from knowingly engaging in any transaction, 
directly or indirectly, with the Government of Iran or any person 
subject to the jurisdiction of the Government of Iran that would be 
prohibited by the ITSR if engaged in by a U.S. person or in the United 
States. Section 560.211 of the ITSR separately prohibits transferring, 
paying, exporting, withdrawing, and dealing in any property and 
interests in property of the Government of Iran, any Iranian financial 
institution, and any other persons whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to the ITSR, unless exempt or authorized 
by OFAC.</span></p> <p><span>In light of these prohibitions, U.S.-owned 
or -controlled foreign entities are required to apply restrictions akin 
to blocking on any property or interests in property of persons subject 
to section 560.211 of the ITSR to ensure that such property and 
interests in property are not transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or
 otherwise dealt in. This requirement applies both with respect to a 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked solely 
pursuant to the ITSR and a person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to the ITSR and another authority (e.g., 
when a person is included on the List of Specially Designated Nationals 
and Blocked Persons with the “[IRAN]” tag, as well as a tag for another 
sanctions program, such as the terrorism tag (“[SDGT]”), nuclear 
proliferation tag (“[NPWMD]”), or human rights tag (“[IRAN-TRA]” or 
“[IRAN-HR]”)).</span></p> <p><span>Section 560.215(b)(1) of the ITSR 
deems an entity to be “owned or controlled” by a U.S. person if the U.S.
 person holds a 50 percent or greater equity interest by vote or value 
in the entity; holds a majority of seats on the board of directors of 
the entity; or otherwise controls the actions, policies, or personnel 
decisions of the entity. [11-05-2018]</span></p> <p> <span>645. How will
 the re-imposition of sanctions on November 5, 2018 impact the provision
 of specialized financial messaging services to Iranian financial 
institutions? </span></p> <p><span>Following the re-imposition of U.S. 
sanctions on November 5, 2018, sanctions that had previously been lifted
 or waived as part of U.S. commitments under the Joint Comprehensive 
Plan of Action (JCPOA) will come back into effect in their entirety, 
including sanctions on the provision of specialized financial messaging 
services to certain Iranian financial institutions.</span></p> <p><span>As
 of November 5, 2018, sanctions on the provision of specialized 
financial messaging services set forth in section 220 of the Iran Threat
 Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (TRA) snap back in full. 
This authority provides for sanctions on specialized financial messaging
 services to the Central Bank of Iran or Iranian financial institutions 
designated in connection with Iran’s support for terrorism or its 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and WMD delivery 
systems, as set out in subsection 104(c)(2)(E)(ii) of the Comprehensive 
Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA) (see
 section 220 of the TRA). Such Iranian financial institutions are listed
 on the SDN List and carry the “[IFSR]” tag. </span></p> <p><span>Furthermore,
 knowingly providing significant financial, material, technological, or 
other support to Iranian persons on the SDN List, other than Iranian 
financial institutions blocked solely pursuant to E.O. 13599 and listed 
on the SDN List with only the “[IRAN]” tag, is sanctionable for persons 
in countries that have not received a significant reduction exception 
(see subsection 1244(c)(1) of IFCA).</span></p> <p><span>To avoid 
potential sanctions exposure, providers of specialized financial 
messaging services should discontinue the provision of such services to 
the Central Bank of Iran and any Iranian financial institutions 
designated in connection with Iran’s WMD proliferation, support for 
terrorism, or human rights abuses. The Central Bank of Iran and such 
designated Iranian financial institutions will have “Subject to 
Secondary Sanctions” listed in the “Identifications” feature in their 
entry on the SDN List.</span></p> <p><span>Given that the U.S. 
government will continue to apply maximum financial pressure on the 
Iranian regime, including potential additional designations of Iranian 
financial institutions, the SDN List should be consulted regularly to 
determine which Iranian financial institutions have been designated.

entity’s ultimate parent, COSCO Shipping Corporation Ltd. (COSCO). 
Similarly, sanctions do not apply to COSCO’s other subsidiaries or 
affiliates (e.g., COSCO Shipping Holdings), provided that such entities

engaging in transactions involving IRISL or E-Sail, including 
transactions for the sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine,

agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical devices, risk 
exposure to sanctions under additional authorities.</p> <p>To avoid 
sanctions risks, U.S. and non-U.S. persons should ensure that 
transactions for the sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, 
or medical devices involving IRISL or E-Sail are concluded no later than
 June 8, 2020, when the designations of IRISL and E-Sail pursuant to

 to wind down transactions by the end of the 90-day wind-down period to 
avoid exposure to sanctions, and be aware that entering into new 
business that would be sanctionable under the E.O. on or after January 
10, 2020 will not be considered wind-down activity and could be

 October 25, 2019, the U.S. Departments of State and the Treasury 
announced a new humanitarian framework to assist foreign governments and
 foreign financial institutions in establishing payment mechanisms to 
facilitate humanitarian exports to Iran that are subject to enhanced due
 diligence. While the United States maintains broad exceptions and 
authorizations for the conduct of humanitarian trade with Iran, this 
humanitarian framework presents an additional, voluntary option for 
facilitating payment for exports of agricultural commodities, food, 
medicine, and medical devices to Iran. The SHTA is the first operational
 channel to be established under this humanitarian framework, in 
partnership with the Swiss government. Initial pilot transactions were 
successfully conducted in late January 2020, and the SHTA was formally 
established on 27 February 2020. Under the SHTA, participating financial
 institutions commit to conducting enhanced due diligence to ensure that
 humanitarian goods reach the people of Iran and are not misused by the 
Iranian regime.</p> <p>For more information on the humanitarian mechanism as announced by the U.S. government, please refer to the <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_humanitarian_20191025.pdf">guidance</a>
 published on the Treasury’s website on October 25, 2019. Additional 
guidance for companies and financial institutions interested in 
participating in the SHTA can be found in the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm919">Treasury SHTA fact sheet</a> and OFAC FAQs <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#825">825</a> and <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#826">826</a>. [02-27-2020]</p> <p>825. How can parties participate in the SHTA to export humanitarian goods to Iran? </p> <p>The
 SHTA is overseen by Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Economic 
Affairs (SECO) and intended for use by U.S. and non-U.S. persons 
domiciled in Switzerland. Exporters within Swiss jurisdiction may reach 
out to SECO at SHTA@seco.admin.ch for further details on requirements 
and instructions for participating in the SHTA. In addition to any due 
diligence imposed under the SHTA, U.S. persons and their owned or 
controlled foreign entities must continue to comply with the Iranian 
Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 560 (ITSR), when 
conducting exports of humanitarian goods to Iran. Certain exports and 
sales of humanitarian goods to Iran are authorized pursuant to sections 
560.530, 560.532, and 560.533 of the ITSR. In addition, General License 8
 provides additional authorization that may be necessary for such 
humanitarian-related transactions due to the Central Bank of Iran’s 
designation under Executive Order 13224, as amended. For further 
information regarding General License 8, please see associated FAQs <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#821">821</a>, <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#822">822</a>, and <a href="file:///resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/faq_iran.aspx#823">823</a>.

 I want to help with the humanitarian response to the Coronavirus 
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Iran. What can I do to help while 
remaining compliant with U.S. sanctions? </p> <p>There are a number of 
ways to provide humanitarian goods or assistance to the Iranian people 
in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran, consistent with U.S. 
sanctions.</p> <p>The making of humanitarian donations to recipients in 
Iran from the United States or by U.S. persons, including the donation 
of medicine intended to relieve human suffering, are generally exempt 
from U.S. sanctions on Iran under section 560.210(b) of the Iranian 
Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR Part 560 (ITSR), provided
 that such donations are not being made to the Government of Iran or 
other persons blocked pursuant to section 560.211 of the ITSR, or to any
 individual or entity listed on OFAC’s list of Specially Designated 
Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List).</p> <p>In addition, the United
 States maintains broad exceptions and authorizations that allow for the
 commercial sale and export of humanitarian goods, including medicine 
and medical devices, to Iran or the Government of Iran from the United 
States or by U.S. persons or U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities,
 subject to certain conditions. U.S. sanctions laws provide similar 
allowances for sales of humanitarian goods, including medicine and 
medical devices, to Iran by non-U.S. persons. These exemptions, 
exceptions, and authorizations generally do not apply to transactions 
involving persons on OFAC’s SDN List that have been designated in 
connection with Iran’s support for international terrorism or 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). For humanitarian transactions 
involving the Central Bank of Iran, which was designated as a Specially 
Designated Global Terrorist pursuant to Executive Order 13224 as 
amended, please see <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/gtsr_gl8.pdf">General License 8</a>

 Following the Secretary of State’s announcement on May 27, 2020 that he
 will be ending certain Iran nuclear-related waivers, will there be a 
wind-down period for persons engaged in activity permitted by these 
waivers? </p> <p> Yes. Persons engaged in activities currently permitted
 by the Department of State’s nuclear-related waivers associated with 
the Arak reactor modernization redesign, the transfer into Iran of 
enriched uranium for the Tehran Research Reactor, and the transfer out 
of Iran of certain nuclear fuel scrap and of spent research reactor fuel
 will have a final, 60-day wind-down period in which to cease these 
activities without risking exposure to covered sanctions. The 60-day 
wind-down period ends on July 27, 2020. Persons engaged in such 
activities should take the steps necessary to wind down those activities
 by July 27, 2020 to avoid potential exposure to sanctions under U.S. 
law. Persons engaged in such activities after that date may be exposed 
to certain sanctions under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation 
Act (IFCA) absent a waiver or exception. IFCA provides for sanctions on 
persons determined to knowingly provide significant financial, material,
 technological, or other support to, or goods or services in support of 
any activity or transaction on behalf of or for the benefit of, an 
Iranian person on OFAC’s SDN List, such as the Atomic Energy 
Organization of Iran (AEOI). IFCA also provides for sanctions on persons
 determined to knowingly sell, supply, or transfer, directly or 
indirectly, to or from Iran certain materials, including raw and 
semi-finished metals, if the materials are provided to or from an 
Iranian person on OFAC’s SDN List, such as AEOI. For more information,

or products used for sanitation or hygiene or as personal protective 
equipment for use in Iran pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13902 for 
continuing to manufacture these items? </p> <p>No. For the purposes of evaluating sanctions pursuant to <a href="file:///resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/13902.pdf">E.O. 13902</a>,
 persons in Iran manufacturing medicines, medical devices, or products 
used for sanitation, hygiene, medical care, medical safety, and 
manufacturing safety, including soap, hand sanitizer, ventilators,

items, personal protective equipment, and manufacturing safety systems, 
solely for use in Iran and not for export from Iran, will not be 
considered to be operating in the manufacturing sector of the Iranian 
economy. Note that persons conducting or facilitating transactions for 
the provision, including any sale, of agricultural commodities, food, 
medicine, or medical devices to Iran will not be subject to sanctions 
under E.O. 13902. </p> <p>E.O. 13902 imposes sanctions with respect to 
any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation 
with the Secretary of State, to operate in the construction, mining, 
manufacturing, and textiles sectors of the Iranian economy, and any 
additional sectors of the Iranian economy as may be determined by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State. 
Iranian and non-Iranian persons operating in these sectors could be 
subject to sanctions pursuant to E.O. 13902. </p> <p>The United States 
maintains broad exceptions and authorizations that allow for the 
commercial sale and export of humanitarian goods, including medicine and
 medical devices, to Iran or the Government of Iran from the United 
States or by U.S. persons or U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities.
 However, these authorizations and exceptions do not apply to 
transactions involving persons on OFAC’s List of Specially Designated 
Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) that have been designated in 
connection with Iran’s support for international terrorism or 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including designated 
Iranian financial institutions or the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
