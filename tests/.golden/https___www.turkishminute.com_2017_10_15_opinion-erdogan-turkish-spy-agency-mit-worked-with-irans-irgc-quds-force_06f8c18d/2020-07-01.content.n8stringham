<p class="rm-manual">by Abdullah Bozkurt</p>
<p>The main reason why Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is 
terrified about a US federal case involving Iranian sanction buster Reza
 Zarrab, who bribed Turkish ministers and banking officials, is the fact
 that his secretive cooperation with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps 
(IRGC) will be exposed, and he will be called to account.</p>
<figcaption>Abdullah Bozkurt</figcaption><p>Perhaps the botched 
corruption investigations of December 2013 that implicated Erdoğan and 
his family members is the least of the Turkish president’s worries given
 the bigger stakes in his much more troubling exposure in a separate but
 linked investigation called Tawhid Salam (Tevhid Selam in Turkish). The
 investigation that was launched by prosecutors in İstanbul on April 8, 
2011 under case file 2011/762 uncovered the most sophisticated espionage
 network run by the IRGC’s Quds Force in Turkey. An almost 
three-year-long probe identified key Turkish and Iranian operatives, 
some under the cover of a diplomatic assignment attached to the Iranian 
Embassy and consulates, as they targeted Western interests, specifically
 Israel and US missions.</p>
<p>The probe, a copy of which I obtained, is a jaw-dropping and chilling
 account of how the IRGC Quds Force runs a very comprehensive network in
 Turkey in all sectors. It lays bare the extent and the depth of 
infiltration in Turkish institutions by Iranian elements. When the graft
 network involving Erdoğan, his family members and associates was 
revealed with the December 17 and 25 investigations, Erdoğan did not 
hastily go after the police, prosecutors and judges who investigated 
corruption in the government. But rather, his immediate attention was 
turned to a separate and confidential investigation, the Tevhid Selam 
case, which was not known to the public.</p>
<p>The Turkish president knew conspiring with the IRGC against the 
long-standing security concerns of Turkey and the US with regard to Iran
 would land him in hotter water than the graft probes would. Therefore, 
he was much more worried about Tevhid Selam than anything else at that 
moment. Only after chief investigators were removed from Tevhid Selam, 
prosecutors replaced and the case hushed up did Erdoğan go after other 
investigators and prosecutors who uncovered a multibillion-dollar graft 
network. Zarrab, a naturalized Turkish citizen who moved the IRGC’s 
funds to Iran through gold and fictitious trade under the protection by 
the Turkish government, is the missing link that connects the dots 
between the graft and Tevhid Selam cases.</p>
<p>The investigators who probed the IRGC’s clandestine network in Turkey
 that penetrated the Turkish political and intelligence apparatus came 
across Zarrab’s name in their own separate and independent 
investigation. In the Dec.17 graft probe, he was the key suspect, but in
 the Tevhid Selam case he was a low-key figure whose name came up when a
 top IRGC general revealed how Iran had tapped him to move state funds 
to circumvent financial sanctions.</p>
<p>In other words, Zarrab was only a small fish in a larger game that 
was set up by Iran and benefited Erdoğan personally with millions of 
dollars. If Zarrab decides to cut a deal with federal prosecutors, he 
might very well spill the beans on Erdoğan, who is afraid of that 
specter. Just last week he made this fear public by saying that the US 
wants to turn Zarrab into an informer.</p>
<p>I have written extensively in the past about the Tevhid Selam case 
but not about the Zarrab connection to the case. Since he will stand 
trial on Nov. 27 in federal court in New York, it is time to shed some 
light on how the Zarrab-Erdoğan-IRGC triangle worked. The man who is in 
charge of IRGC Quds Force operations in Turkey is Gen. Sayed Ali Akber 
Mir Vakili, at least he was until Erdoğan derailed the probe and alerted
 him and other Iranian agents to flee Turkey in 2014. In a phone wiretap
 dated Sept. 19, 2013 which was recorded under court order, Mir Vakili 
was heard talking about Zarrab’s role with Hakkı Selçuk Şanlı, a Turkish
 national who was developed as an asset by IRGC commander Nasir Takipur 
in the 1990s. Mir Vakili was complaining on the phone that he had 
incurred some losses from the gold moved by Zarrab from Turkey to Iran 
when he converted the gold to currency. He described Zarrab as “our 
Reza,” calling him by his first name, and described the gold scheme run 
between Turkey and Iran thorough the United Arab Emirates as a 
“project.”</p>
<p>In another wiretap dated June 18, 2013, Mir Vakili mentioned some 
problems in state lender Halkbank and talked about Zarrab and his 
connections to Zafer Cağlayan, the then-economy minister who helped 
Zarrab move funds by pressuring officials at Halkbank in exchange for 
commissions on each cash transfer. Mir Vakili explained that besides 
Zarrab, there was another Iranian who lived in Turkey and was involved 
in the oil business. He said the Iranian was also very close to Erdoğan.
 The IRGC general briefly talked about using other Turkish banks besides
 Halkbank to move funds and discussed with Şanlı how to bribe Turkish 
officials. There were other wiretaps in the investigation file where 
Zarrab’s name mentioned as the man who had been certified by Iranian 
authorities to run the scheme and his close connections to Bank Mellat 
in Iran.</p>
<p>Given the profile of the suspects involved in this case, it is quite 
likely that some of these funds were used by the IRGC Quds Force to 
finance terrorism operations in various countries. For example, Şanlı, 
who operated under the command of Mir Vakili, is no ordinary figure. He 
was instrumental in setting up the Quds Force operation in Turkey in the
 1990s and was involved in terror attacks targeting Turkish and US 
interests while he was working for IRGC general Takipur. According to 
Turkish court documents, the Tevhid Selam terrorist group assassinated 
eight people in the 1990s, including journalist Uğur Mumcu, Professor 
Bahriye Üçok, journalist Ahmet Taner Kışlalı and several other 
Kemalist/secularist intellectuals in Turkey as well as foreign diplomats
 such as Abdul Ghani Bedawi, a Saudi diplomat working as the second 
secretary at the Saudi Arabian Embassy; Ehud Sadan, the Israeli 
Embassy’s top security officer in Ankara; and Victor Marwick, who worked
 for a Turkish-US logistics group.</p>
<p>Şanlı was arrested on May, 13, 2000 in police raids on the 
Tevhid-Salam network, but his boss Takipur fled to Iran. Şanlı was tried
 and sentenced to 12 years, six months in prison but was freed in 2004 
when then-Prime Minister Erdoğan’s government passed an amnesty law in 
Parliament reducing sentences for some convicts. Police discovered that 
Şanlı, after his release, had kept a low profile before he was 
reactivated by the IRGC as a courier to deliver Iranian hush money to 
the families of the murderers of Mumcu and others killed in the 1990s on
 orders from the IRGC. There was strong evidence in the case file as to 
how this money was disbursed, to whom and under what schemes, with close
 supervision by Mir Vakili.</p>
<p>In a wiretap dated May 25, 2013, Şanlı talks about how he was 
relieved when Hakan Fidan, a pro-Iranian figure, was appointed to lead 
Turkey’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Organization (MIT). There
 is overwhelming evidence in the file showing that Fidan, Erdoğan’s 
close confidante, cooperated closely with Mir Vakili. For example, a 
wiretap dated June 18, 2013 reveals Fidan was passing confidential 
information on Cabinet meetings to the Quds Force commander, who said he
 learned from Fidan that then-Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc had 
tendered his resignation after a heated exchange with Erdoğan, who 
defended a brutal crackdown on protestors during the Gezi Park 
anti-government rallies. Fidan was secretly meeting with Mir Vakili in a
 cafe owned by another Iranian operative in Ankara’s Cukurambar 
district, which is patronized by the new Islamist elite in Ankara.</p>
<p>The most damaging parts of the Tevhid Selam investigation are the 
revelations on how Erdoğan personally met with Mir Vakili on several 
occasion while the IRGC general was under criminal investigation on 
terrorism and other charges by Turkish prosecutors. The first documented
 meeting took place in the prime minister’s office in Dolmabahce Palace 
on Nov. 24, 2012. The meeting was publicly announced as an official 
meeting between Erdoğan and visiting Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali 
Larijani. Yet, Mir Vakili and Fidan also attended the meeting, and later
 the two had a second, separate meeting as well. The intercepted SMS 
messages between Mir Vakili and Şanlı on the same day showed how the 
Quds Force commander asked his man Şanlı to come to Erdoğan’s office and
 told him about his meetings with the Turkish prime minister and 
intelligence chief. CCTV surveillance camera footage showing the two 
meeting in the parking lot of Erdoğan’s office were also included in the
 investigation file.</p>
<p>The series of intercepted communications as well as physical 
surveillance evidence reveal Mir Vakili came to Ankara with a group of 
people on Oct. 23, 2013, after he was assured of high-level meetings. He
 was provided a protective detail from MIT with orders from Fidan, who 
wanted to make sure the meetings were kept secret and avoid any trouble 
from legal investigations that were still under way at the time. Mir 
Vakili was granted a private meeting with then-Foreign Minister Ahmet 
Davutoğlu and later had a 15-minute meeting with Erdoğan in the prime 
minister’s private home in Keçiören on Oct. 25, 2013. Mir Vakili and 
his group returned to Iran the same day on a Turkish government plane 
provided by MIT without clearing immigration or customs.</p>
<p>The police investigators working under authorization from the 
prosecutors had mapped out this traffic in great detail and collected 
overwhelming, incriminating evidence against the IRGC operatives who had
 infiltrated Turkey. Secret military maps of the southeastern provinces 
of Adana and Gaziantep and surveillance evidence around the NATO early 
warning radar system in Malatya’s Kürecik district were seized from the 
Iranian operatives. The IRGC scouted areas around the Çekmece Nuclear 
Research and Training Center (ÇNAEM) in İstanbul as well as the Israeli 
and American consulates in the same city. The maps collected during the 
probe have markings and explanations of entry and exit points at the 
targeted facilities.</p>
<p>Erdoğan, who calls Iran his second home, has allowed this terror 
network to act with impunity in NATO alliance territory despite the fact
 that the spy ring has violated several Turkish penal code articles, 
from terrorism to espionage. It was also a poke in the eye of Turkey’s 
key ally the US despite repeated assurances by the Erdoğan government to
 Turkey’s commitments to US security interests. Fidan, a Shiite who was 
tapped as an asset while he was a noncommissioned officer in the 1990s 
from the days when he participated in Islamist group study circles in 
Ankara, has been sleeping with the enemy although he was entrusted with 
protecting the nation as the head of the spy agency.</p>
<p>This dirty laundry is what Erdoğan is really worried about if he 
cannot contain the fallout from the Zarrab case in New York. This is why
 he wasted a lot of time and money and called in favors in his frantic 
efforts to try to convince the White House to secure his release when 
those precious resources should have been spent for Turkey’s urgent 
national security needs. Since he failed, Erdoğan has now turned to a 
hostage-taking policy by jailing US citizens as well as Turkish 
nationals who worked as local staff for US missions in Turkey. He is 
desperate.</p>
