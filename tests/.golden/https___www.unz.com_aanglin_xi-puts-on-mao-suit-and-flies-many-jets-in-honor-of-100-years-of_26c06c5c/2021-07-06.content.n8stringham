<p><span>It must be nice to live in a country where your leaders encourage you to be proud of your race and history.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/528075-largest-j20-fleet-china-centenary/">RT</a>:</span></p>
<p><span> China’s Mighty Dragon J-20 stealth fighter jets flew over 
Beijing’s historic landmark in their largest display yet – a show of 
might to commemorate the founding of the Communist Party 100 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span>Beijing showcased the power of its air force during centenary 
celebrations for the Communist Party of China (CPC) on Thursday. The 
15-strong fighter jet fleet flew in three V-shaped formations, with five
 planes forming each arrow. </span></p>
<p><span> In an interview with the Sina news outlet, J-20 pilot Cao 
Cheng detailed the symbolism of the demonstration and explained how the 
fleet flew in uniform precision: “Each wedge team has five fighter jets 
organized into three squadrons … which symbolizes that the People’s Air 
Force is invincible and has invincible courage.”</span></p>
<p><span>He added that all the members of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force had practised tirelessly to pull off the feat.</span></p>
<p><span>The number of fighter jets that took part in the air show is 
unprecedented, the largest number having previously been five. Those 
aircraft had been taking part in the National Day military parade in 
2019, which was also held in the Chinese capital. </span></p>
<p><span>And what a fleet!</span></p>
<p><span>The helicopters flying in the shape of “100” is also impressive.</span></p>
<p><span>Very lovely.</span></p>
<p><span>Much happiness for tender family affairs.</span></p>
<p><span>I think this issue of “Chinese communism” should be addressed 
at length, again. I’m not going to do that right now, because I’m 
exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span>But I will say: China is not a communist country, and the so-called “Chinese Communist Party” is not a communist party.</span></p>
<p><span>Mao Zedong tried to do communism.</span></p>
<p><span>Then he backed up on it. Then he died in 1976, and China became a beast of productivity.</span></p>
<p><span>China is the most futuristic country on earth. While American 
smart meters are turning off the air-conditioning in 100 degree weather 
in Texas and New York is sending notices to turn off the microwave so 
the power doesn’t go out, everyone in China is rich and living in 
luxury.</span></p>
<p><span>Elon Musk recently said it. I check his Twitter account 
obsessively and the memes are horrible (literally the worst I’ve ever 
seen), but he’s right about this.</span></p>
<p>The economic prosperity that China has achieved is truly amazing, 
especially in infrastructure! I encourage people to visit and see for 
themselves. </p>
<p><span>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1410413958805270533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2021</a></span></p>
<p><span>You have to go to China to really understand that this is an 
ultra-futuristic society of tremendous wealth and prosperity, as well as
 national pride and sense of national identity.</span></p>
<p><span>Obviously, China could not have undergone the massive project 
of modernization that they’ve undergone since the death of Mao if it was
 a communist system. Communism, as we are aware, leads to mass 
starvation and general doom.</span></p>
<p><span>The Chinese system is called “Socialism with Chinese 
Characteristics.” The number one “Chinese characteristic” is 
“mercantilism,” which is basically the opposite of communism.</span></p>
<p><span>I doubt that even one in twenty Chinese people could explain to
 you any of the basic concepts of Marxist-Leninist theory. And they are 
well educated. The Chinese education system purposefully doesn’t teach 
about it, because everyone has a grandparent that has a horror story 
about the 1960s and the attempts at collectivization. This is not 
considered by the nation to be a definitive aspect of their society, but
 rather a weird experiment that went sideways.</span></p>
<p><span>As of right now, Xi Jinping is effectively the Emperor. There 
is really no difference between his role and the traditional role of the
 Emperor. He is following the Confucian ideal of “philosopher king,” 
even.</span></p>
<p><span>Every Chinese bookstore has books of his sayings on display, 
and every week he makes new philosophical statements about how you 
should love your family and be respectful to women and your co-workers.</span></p>
<p><span>The only relationship that China has to “communism” is some of the wholesome and cutesy aesthetics here and there.</span></p>
<p><span>Like this picture from the celebration:</span></p>
<p><span>(Note the lack of masks!)</span></p>
<p><span>But you say “what about the fact that it’s called the communist party????”</span></p>
<p><span>Well, actually, if you think it is called that, then you don’t understand the Chinese language.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s not really called that.</span></p>
<p><span>It is called: “中国共产党.”</span></p>
<p><span>Those are characters. Not letters and not really words. The entire structure of the language is totally different.</span></p>
<p><span>“中国” means “China” and “共产党” is translated as “communist party”
 in English. The word is “Gòngchǎndǎng.” That is “gong,” “chǎn” and 
“dǎng.” A direct translation, as it would be spoken in Chinese, would be
 “The Party of People Working Together to be Productive.” That is how it
 sounds in Chinese, and that is how people hear it in Chinese. In the 
Chinese mind, there is no reference to Marx, collectivization, abolition
 of property, or anything else that is associated with Marxist 
communism.</span></p>
<p><span>To give an example of how Chinese translations are manipulated –
 back in the 1950s up through the 1990s, the leader of China was called a
 “Chairman” in the English media. Then, when the West thought China was 
going to become a “democracy,” they all of a sudden changed the word to 
“President.” The word in Chinese, “主席,” remained the same. It means 
something like “the seat of the lord.”</span></p>
<p><span>But by changing the word from “Chairman” to “President” in the 
translated English media, it gave the impression that there was some 
massive political shift in China, that they had somehow rearranged their
 entire governmental system, and were no longer alien to us.</span></p>
<p><span>Now that China is an enemy again, I wouldn’t be surprised if 
they started calling Xi “Chairman” again. Of course, if they did that, 
people might ask if he’d changed his title, and then people would maybe 
start to figure out the way this translation issue is manipulated.</span></p>
<p><span>You should remember this fact every time you see one of these 
assholes on TV saying “CHINESE COMMUNISM.” They are purposefully trying 
to confuse you by dragging up imagery of boogiemen from the 20th 
century.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that helps.</span></p>

<p class="rm-manual">None of the countries that called themselves 
communist actually achieved it. They were supposedly working towards it 
when they gave up on it. Nowadays who is left, China, DPRK, anybody 
else? Nixon traveled to China to shake the hand of Mao who one could 
call a convinced communist. So, what’s a little ideology or a little 
warfare a couple decades prior when there’s money and opportunity 
beckoning? Wasn’t a barrier then, was it? Now that they’ve gotten bigger
 and competitive on the world stage they’re being demonized along with 
Russia and Iran. It’s the American lie machine blaring full spectrum 
propaganda 24/7 that’s deluding the mass of people out there, pounding 
out easy to digest slogans over and over. </p> </li>

 quite difficult to develop and maintain the habit of always distrusting
 the mainstream media and politicians, but this is a must for any 
autonomous individual today. When the West says “China oppresses 
Christians” this is easy to believe due to our collective memory of the 
worst moments of totalitarianism in Russia and China especially in the 
middle of the 20th century.</p> <p class="rm-manual">But this is the 
21st century, twenty odd years in. And today in Russia Christians have 
more rights than in the West, and in China–especially now in the period 
of rampant globohomo + viral pneumonia dystopia–also more rights than in
 the West.</p> <p class="rm-manual">When globohomo says “pastor of 
underground church in China arrested by police” they mean to convey 
through these word choices a vision of huddled believers cowering in 
catacombs, hunted down and thrown to ferocious pandas on stadiums filled
 with evil commies. In reality, when this happens in China (and Russia, 
btw) this means that some guy, frequently a CIA asset, is running an 
explicitly forbidden cult from his apartment. This is the “pastor” and 
the “underground church”.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Christianity is 
spreading through China at lightning speed, and the authorities are not 
oppressing Christians, to the contrary, as long as the born again give 
unto Caesar and otherwise focus on hard work and family values, then 
everything is perfect.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I myself, though, would 
be highly skeptical of allowing evangelical Christianity of spreading 
through my country, if I am constantly called the “main enemy” by the 
Anglosphere. Because no doubt evangelical Christianity is indeed to a 
large extent ran by CIA jews, and this is indeed building up a 5th 
column among the educated urban middle-classes in China’s most important
 cities.</p> <p class="rm-manual">However, Catholicism would also be a 
trojan horse of the Satanic Pope, without the buffer of traditional 
pre-satanic Catholicism like they have for example in Poland, now would 
be the worst time to introduce Catholicism into a “virgin” society. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Orthodoxy,
 in theory the best choice, is however impossible, because its center is
 a huge neighbor called Russia, with whom China shares thousands of 
miles of border. Too close for comfort. Friendship is friendship but 
pragmatism is pragmatism.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Apparently the 
Chinese govt has decided that it’s less risky to allow the local 
spiritual seekers to become Evangelicals, because their center is across
 the Pacific ocean as opposed to across the river Amur. But I don’t 
know, I don’t know… Keeping in mind what a number “evangelical 
Christianity” played on the US boomers, turning them into drooling 
Zionists over the decades that so curiously coincided with the time of 
general civilizational collapse, we’ve yet to see how China can handle 
this potential threat.</p> <p class="rm-manual">It could very well be 
that “fellow chinese people” are already drifting into key positions all
 across the evangelical networks that influence China’s new urban 
generation. A sort of mega-sized repetition of Falun Gong’s 
takeover-from-the-inside attempt back in the day. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Agree: <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=thou%2Fthee%2Fthine+pronouns">thou/thee/thine pronouns</a></p><p class="rm-manual"> • Thanks: <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=Mustapha+Mond">Mustapha Mond</a>, <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=Joe+Levantine">Joe Levantine</a></p><p class="rm-manual"> • Troll: <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=Grahamsno%28G64%29">Grahamsno(G64)</a></p><p class="rm-manual"> • Replies: <span><a href="#comment-4757021"><span>@Drapetomaniac</span></a></span>, <span><a href="#comment-4757126"><span>@Anonymous</span></a></span>, <span><a href="#comment-4757459"><span>@Mustapha Mond</span></a></span>, <span><a href="#comment-4758067"><span>@Joe Levantine</span></a></span>, <span><a href="#comment-4762576"><span>@Mulga Mumblebrain</span></a></span></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

<p class="rm-manual">“As of right now, Xi Jinping is effectively the Emperor.”</p> <p class="rm-manual">Based
 on how well things are going, the CCP decided that Xi has “the Mandate 
of Heaven”, so they decided to let him stay on rather than rotate 
someone else in. In fact, the CCP could be considered the current 
dynasty and the heirs to the Qing. Traditionally in China, when there is
 a dynastic transition is when the shit really hits the fan. Seems to 
happen about every 300 years or so. The last transitory period took 
place from the Taiping Rebellion through the Cultural Revolution. It’s 
been all uphill since then. </p> </li>

<p class="rm-manual">The Chinese offered their masses of cheap labor to 
Western capitalists and the capitalists were glad to oblige by moving 
production to China. Wealth follows production. It is a simple formula 
once followed by the USA: develop domestic production, protect it from 
cheap foreign competition, and prosper. This worked as long as the US 
economy was tariff-protected and restricted immigration. Once ideologues
 abolished that system, the temptation to outsource production to cheap 
labor venues and import more cheap labor became more than the 
capitalists could resist. Capitalists are obsessed with competing by 
cutting costs and that means cutting labor costs. The results are all 
around us. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Agree: <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=Marshal+Marlow">Marshal Marlow</a></p>

 very much appreciate Andrew doing the largely thankless work to try to 
convince the American Right that conflict with China is not just useless
 and counter-productive but built on a foundation of lies like every 
other conflict the ruling elite have ginned up. </p> <p class="rm-manual">However,
 as this article gets into what Chinese “Communism” is and what it is 
not, I thought I would piggy back on your comment with my “Lefty” hat 
on. </p> <p class="rm-manual">What is 3rd world “Communism.” It is not 
what most people think it is. In general, a precondition for 
industrialization is a social and institutional structure in which the 
surplus produced by a nation is invested in the building up of plant and
 equipment, or improving the skills of its people. The surplus here is 
defined as output of goods and services over and above the “minimum” 
required to maintain the working ability of the population. A nation can
 produce a surplus, but that does not mean that it finds its way towards
 the building of industry. A CEO purchasing a 5th mega Yacht is spending
 surplus resources, but productive capacity is not improved. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Notwithstanding
 the genuine contributions that a landed aristocracy can make, a feudal 
ruling class tends to waste surplus resources in various forms of lavish
 and frivolous consumption. That is why a near universal historical 
truth seems to be that industrialization follows a bourgeois social 
revolution in which the landed aristocracy is either liquidated (France)
 or made politically subordinate to Capital. The leadership of a nation 
needs to be transferred to an elite who will use the economic surplus in
 a responsible fashion. </p> <p class="rm-manual">In the East, due to a 
variety of historical circumstances, a large and independent bourgeois 
or capitalist class was largely lacking, and thus the political 
leadership required to depose the feudal aristocracy could not come from
 such a class as it has in the West. Instead, peculiar “bourgeois” 
revolutions occurred – ones characterized by an intelligentsia leading a
 peasant war. However, once having overthrown the feudal elite, these 
nations found themselves turning towards the use of the State as a an 
instrument for allocating the social surplus towards rapid 
industrialization as a domestic capitalist class was absent. In short, 
what we call Communist revolutions are really the East’s State 
Capitalist Revolutions. The historical function of State Capitalism 
being the building up the productivity of the people by means of proper 
surplus allocation, towards industry and towards the education of one’s 
people. </p> <p class="rm-manual">In the beginning there were many 
mistakes and problems as Communist ideas were mixed in with the overall 
transformation and State led initiatives are often plagued by 
inefficiencies and mismanagement. But the mixed economy path, the 
Socialist Market economy, that China has adopted should be seen as the 
natural path of the revolution that Mao initiated. The purpose was never
 overthrowing a capitalist class, as such a class really didn’t exist. 
The revolution was anti-feudal and aimed at establishing a social order 
in which the output and human talent of the nation could be used for 
national advancement as opposed to conspicuous consumption of a largely 
parasitic elite. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Why does our parasitic elite 
fear China? Maybe because they see themselves in the Qing dynasty. 
Speaking of feudalism, does anyone recall the wide-spread use of eunuchs
 and castrati under those systems? No wonder our Neo-feudal elite likes 
trannyism so much. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Agree: <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=Godfree+Roberts">Godfree Roberts</a></p><p class="rm-manual"> • Thanks: <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=Joe+Levantine">Joe Levantine</a></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 If the Western elites would have smart, long term thinking and having a
 racial preservation agenda, they would be spreading Communism 
throughout the Third World. Actually the Western elites did fund or 
support Communist movements in Russia, China, USSR etc… but should have 
spread closed style Communism throughout the Third World. Nothing keeps 
nations poor (poverty preservation) as well as brings down the birth 
rate at the same time as Communism. If China had not opened up during 
Deng, it would have remained a poor country and the USA would not have 
been in the dire straits as it is today. Capitalism is flawed because it
 runs blindly after profits, it does not care much about race, 
civilization etc…</p><p class="rm-manual"> If the West would be smart, 
they would have worked on de-Westernising the Third World. Either pushed
 Communism or Islamic fundamentalism, Hindutva etc… which would have 
kept these countries backward. Westernising non-White populations have 
been the biggest mistake for the White race from a racial point of view.
 That is why Hitler was against this spreading of Westernism among 
non-Whites. Similarly had the Jews stayed in their ghettos, they would 
not have been able to cause all that damage to White societies. They 
could have been slowly pushed to the Middle East in their ghetto 
clothes. White Man’s burden became White man’s suicide. Let the Arab go

they’re generally a pretty pleasant people. </p> <p class="rm-manual">But there are also some troubling signs (some of which has been on FTN recently): </p> <p class="rm-manual">1.
 Financial liberalization, entry of private equity and global asset

 a big deal down the line since this lets global asset managers put a

attacking Chinese citizens in the same style as American media. To be 
fair this seems to be more common in their English language media, so 
you can argue it’s aimed at an overseas audience, but still. Even for 
domestic stuff like Baidu Beike (wikipedia version), it’s very pro-gay.

 in state media like Globaltimes / China Daily. You can argue it’s just a

 think the big thing is that China’s continued efforts to improve itself
 and advance (whatever the methods) are to be respected. They don’t 
detract from us. Even America grew through intellectual property theft 
(robbing the Germans blind, and the Soviet Satellite). In China’s case, 
the technology was sometimes literally handed to them, which is 
something every single country letting production happen inside its 
country should ask for. One of the reasons the EU and US hated Gadaffi 
was his requirements for technical training of Libyans.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Of
 course, you’ll find people who cheer China on as a way of wishing for 
your death (I’ve seen some of the fights). These people mostly are just 
leaking vengeance against wider issues they’ve seen. I get it too, 
because I want America to be better, and sometimes that means thinking 
it needs to die, like so many foolish people around the world. Then we

 real thing is that every country should strive to be a modern China, 
just as they should have strived to be a 19th-century America way back 
when (post-slavery issue), or a Russia around 1912. It doesn’t mean 
copying everything. No one should copy, because Americans are their own 
special group with their own traditions, just as the Japanese are.</p> <p class="rm-manual">It’s
 not perfect, because nothing is, but by taking what we can from the 
Chinese model, and maintain actual healthy trade relations (like China 
does, tariffs where appropriate, SOE’s where appropriate, and “free” 
trade where it’s healthy) we can prosper too.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Even
 though any sensible country will always be dealing with our elites and 
industries on a political level, on a personal level, we are the ones 
who have more in common with them. Take advantage of that, and over here
 we can work to make our own country what it ought to be, rather than 
is. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Replies: <span><a href="#comment-4758959"><span>@Sick of Orcs</span></a></span>, <span><a href="#comment-4759409"><span>@Mulga Mumblebrain</span></a></span></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 I’m positive many people died, and it probably numbered in the 
millions. Specific numbers and calculations are subject to both 
propaganda and changing facts. I kind of think the 40 million is a bit 
like the Jewish 6 million in that regards. I’m absolutely agreed though 
that Maoism and the Cultural Revolution were overall destructive for 
China and the Chinese people (there are arguments against that, but I’ll
 weigh against those at this stage). I don’t think anyone forgets the 
suffering, it’s more about where they are now and what are they doing 
now relative to America.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Well, they did carbon 
copy it, but they copied the earlier version that actually made stuff 
and managed itself. Then, unlike the West, they never let those economic
 institutions wield political power, and then continued developing more 
complex control and response mechanisms, so they had a solidly

 sense in new economies.)</p> <p class="rm-manual">If our Judeo-tyranny

 propagandists claim that Mao ‘murdered’ 25 to 50 million people during 
the Great Leap Forward by allegedly ‘starving’ them to death. And yet 
the high estimate of the death toll in China during the Second 
Sino-Japanese War is 20 million after eight years of warfare. In other 
words, Mao’s Great Leap Forward somehow caused the deaths of 25 to 50 
million people in three years of peacetime while the Second 
Sino-Japanese War caused the deaths of 20 million in eight years of 
wartime. That’s not possible considering that China had a grain surplus 
which was exported to the Soviet Union as part of the ‘grains-for-nukes’
 deal signed in 1957. Also, China already had 30,000 kms of railroads by
 1960, compared to 10,000 kms of railroads (mostly in 
Japanese-controlled Manchuria) during WWII. With that kind of 
infrastructure during peacetime which is necessary to transport food 
crops for export (as well as for domestic consumption), it’s not 
possible for the Great Leap Forward to cause that kind of death toll 
exceeding the Second Sino-Japanese War during WWII. </p> <p class="rm-manual">What
 is the truth? The truth is that Western propagandists fabricated the 
alleged death toll of 25 to 50 million by paying both Chinese and 
Western researchers to conduct spurious studies based on dubious 
‘statistical evidence’ to demonize Mao. This Western propaganda effort 
was dictated by the political exigencies of the Cold War which required 
sanitizing Hirohito while the rehabilitating Japan as the US bulwark 
against Soviet Communism in Asia.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Everyone 
knows that the Imperial Japanese Army waged an imperialist war of 
aggression against China, Korea, Southeast Asia, India and the West by 
committing ‘war crimes’ which caused the deaths of up to 30 million 
people in Asia, including several hundred thousand Western POWs treated 
as slave labor during WWII. Yet after WWII, MacArthur protected Hirohito
 and other Japanese officers from prosecution for ‘war crimes’ including
 the notorious Lieutenant General Shiro Ishii who ran the infamous Unit 
731 bioweapons lab of the Imperial Japanese Army. </p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 political exigencies of the Cold War forced the Yanks to abandon the 
Japanese war crimes trials. The Western propagandists then proceeded to 
‘sanitize’ Hirohito as the USA waged a Cold War to contain Soviet 
Communism in Asia. To this day, the USA has remained silent on the ‘war 
crimes’ committed by the Imperial Japanese Army during WWII while the US
 servicemen who suffered from those ‘war crimes’ have not received any 
apology nor compensation from Japan. All you hear in the USA is “Nazi 
this, Nazi that” but when it comes to the Japs, nary a single word.</p> <p class="rm-manual">THAT is the truth. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Thanks: <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=showmethereal">showmethereal</a></p><p class="rm-manual"> • Replies: <span><a href="#comment-4759705"><span>@Sick of Orcs</span></a></span>, <span><a href="#comment-4760072"><span>@showmethereal</span></a></span></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 long as the male/female imbalance remains in China you should expect 
strong tendencies towards either homosexuality or Buddhism in China. If 
you have excess males who are not being killed off in war (I personally 
don’t expect China to initiate a major war, though they may move on 
Taiwan eventually) then some of those males will have to lean towards a 
lifestyle which is other than heterosexual pairing. That means either 
religion (most likely Buddhism, though Christianity has spread in Asia 
too) or some other eclectic lifestyle choice (with homosexuality being 
one of the more obvious possibilities). This problem will only change if
 more average Chinese accept the idea of breeding a daughters-only

 were famines caused by droughts and floods during that period which had
 nothing to do with the economic policies of the Great Leap Forward. But
 those were isolated incidents which would have caused the deaths of at 
most a few hundred thousand people, not the diabolical 25 to 50 million 
figures put forth by Western propagandists. There is no mass 
consciousness of a ‘Great Famine’ which would have been etched into the 
living memory of succeeding generations. Instead, the people living in 
places such as Sichuan where the worst famines were supposed to have 
taken place are fond of Mao to this day. Most photographs taken during 
that period show a bunch of people eating together in communal settings 
or building backyard furnaces which implies their strong sense of 
community. Even CIA studies show feverish economic activity as seen in 
increased steel production and rail traffic during that time. </p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 fatal flaw in the ‘Great Famine’ hypothesis is its premise that the 
‘missing’ population of 25 to 50 million must be due to ‘excess deaths’ 
caused by mass starvation. But the ‘missing’ population could be 
attributed to simple factors such as the decline in births during that 
period which some estimates put at 35 million! Natural causes of death 
such as disease, malnutrition, old age, etc. will add a few more million
 ‘excess deaths’, thus accounting for most of the ‘missing’ population.</p> <p class="rm-manual">By
 way of comparison, wartime conditions impose the most severe form of 
economic deprivation known to humans. And yet during the Second 
Sino-Japanese War, about half of the estimated 20 million deaths were 
caused by warfare which means the other half (10 million) can be 
attributed to unnatural causes of death such as war-induced famines. 
That death rate caused by war-induced famines is about 1.2 million per 
year (10 million divided by eight years). If we multiply that by three, 
that gives 3.6 million ‘excess deaths’ caused by wartime deprivation for
 three years. The idea that the economic deprivation of the Great Leap 
Forward which lasted three years could have caused ‘excess deaths’ in 
the range of 25 to 50 million that would have been SEVEN to FOURTEEN 
times worse than the 3.6 million ‘excess deaths’ caused by wartime 
deprivation (for the same period of three years) is ludicrous. THAT is 
simply not possible, not in any way, shape or form.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Occam’s
 Razor says the news of 25 to 50 million ‘excess deaths’ during the 
Great Leap Forward is greatly exaggerated, as Mark Twain would have put 
it, while the news of 30 million ‘excess deaths’ caused by the 
imperialist war of aggression waged by Emperor Hirohito as the 
Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army is an undisputed and 
well-documented FACT.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Any more questions? </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Replies: <span><a href="#comment-4760344"><span>@Sick of Orcs</span></a></span></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 problem that I have with Western narratives on the Great Leap Forward 
is that they’re intended to serve as a political polemic against Maoist 
Communism. Even their so-called Chinese sources including CCP officials 
have questionable integrity after Deng’s decision to strike a ‘deal’ 
with the West. What happened during the 80s was that Deng’s CCP 
collaborated with Western propagandists to ‘demonize’ Mao by 
discrediting Maoist Communism. That’s when all these so-called ‘research
 studies’ published by both Chinese and Western sources started coming 
out claiming to have discovered an alleged ‘Great Famine’ during the 
Great Leap Forward.</p> <p class="rm-manual">To disabuse ourselves of 
the political polemic behind the Western narratives on the Great Leap 
Forward, one can ascertain what really happened by gathering material 
evidence from that time period such as photographs which should show 
masses of people dying in the streets. An alleged Great Famine of that 
magnitude would have affected lots of people (one in ten). So the other 
option is to interview people who lived through that period to get an 
idea of what really happened during that time. I tried both options but 
could not find a single photograph showing masses of people dying in the
 streets nor a single person who lived through that era claiming to have
 seen people dying in the streets. Moreover, there is no collective 
consciousness of an alleged ‘Great Famine’ during the Great Leap Forward
 as people generally thought of that frenetic period as a difficult but 
productive time with lots of new roads, railways, dams, canals, steel 
mills, etc.. being built.</p> <p class="rm-manual">It is quite easy to 
fabricate ‘statistical evidence’ but no ‘material evidence’ can exist if
 a certain phenomenon did not actually happen. My conclusion is that 
Western narratives on the Great Leap Forward is fraudulent from 
inception as they were intended not as a historical account but as a 
political polemic against Maoist Communism. Even their so-called 
‘estimates’ of the alleged death toll caused by the Great Leap Forward —
 which range from 25 to 50 million — is too high to be credible, mostly 
by ignoring the decline in births during that period which is its fatal 
flaw. By way of comparison, the death toll caused by the Second 
Sino-Japanese War during wartime is estimated at 20 million. In other 
words, the alleged death toll of the Great Leap Forward during peacetime
 is supposed to be higher than the estimated death toll of the Second 
Sino-Japanese War during wartime!!! How is that possible? Well, the 
short answer: not possible. That’s why Western propagandists had to 
concoct an alleged death toll HIGHER than 20 million to make Mao look 
worse than Hirohito.</p> <p class="rm-manual">To show just how absurd 
the Western narratives on the Great Leap Forward is, Amartya Sen wryly 
observed that had the same criteria used to ‘demonize’ Mao as the 
world’s greatest ‘mass murderer’ be applied to India, then Indian 
leaders would easily take that morbid title as India had far worse life 
expectancy during the ENTIRE period of Maoist Communism from 1949-1976, 
including its worst years of the Great Leap Forward.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Any more questions? </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Replies: <span><a href="#comment-4761649"><span>@Ron Unz</span></a></span>, <span><a href="#comment-4763664"><span>@Sick of Orcs</span></a></span></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 I don’t mean to divert the discussion, but I can’t remember if you were

 you can see, there’s a *gigantic* “hole” in the age-cohort born around

seems like exactly what one would expect to see after a huge famine, and
 suggests population losses well into the tens of millions, since many 
non-infants obviously died as well.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Back a few 
months ago, I’d read TOMBSTONE, written by a retired high-ranking PRC 
journalist, with the assistance of many other PRC provincial officials

8-10 different demographic estimates of the total GLF losses, most of 
which seemed to be in the range of 35 million deaths, with additional 
tens of millions of population losses due to reduced fertility. I think 
those sorts of numbers seem pretty consistent with the official 
population-pyramid.</p> </blockquote> <p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.unz.com/article/poverty-and-inequality-in-china/?showcomments#comment-4171272" rel="nofollow">https://www.unz.com/article/poverty-and-inequality-in-china/?showcomments#comment-4171272</a></p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Thanks: <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=Boomthorkell">Boomthorkell</a></p><p class="rm-manual"> • Replies: <span><a href="#comment-4761810"><span>@Patrick McNally</span></a></span>, <span><a href="#comment-4761842"><span>@antibeast</span></a></span></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 remember that conversion we had in that thread. But I concluded based 
on the population pyramid that the decline in the birth rates during 
that period would amount to tens of millions of unborn children which 
would substract substantially from the alleged death toll of tens of 
millions during the Great Leap Forward (GLF), leaving only millions not 
tens of millions of excess deaths.</p> <p class="rm-manual">As for 
authors like Yang Jisheng, his work is similar to other ‘research 
studies’ which draw upon ‘statistical evidence’, neither of which are 
incontrovertible given their political nature. I am a not demographer 
but an engineer by training but I can still grasp what they’re trying to
 convey using ‘statistical evidence’. However, in the field of ‘systems’
 engineering, one can model the behavior of ‘systems’ by treating it as a
 ‘box’ with a set of ‘inputs’ and ‘outputs’, without the need to 
understand the internal structure of the ‘systems’ being modeled.</p> <p class="rm-manual">My
 response today would be to compare the imputed death toll of 25-50M 
caused by economic deprivation during the GLF which lasted three years 
with the estimated death toll of 10M caused by economic deprivation, 
excluding the estimated 10M deaths caused by warfare, during the Second 
Sino-Japanese War (SSJW) which lasted eight years. The imputed GLF death
 rate comes to 8.3-16.6M/yr while the estimated SSJW death rate comes to
 1.25M/yr. From a ‘systems’ engineering framework, let’s treat each 
event as a ‘system’ and model it as a ‘box’ with a set of ‘inputs’ and 
‘outputs’. The ‘inputs’ can be the length of railroads, food production,
 steel production and other factors of national productivity which could
 affect the ‘outputs’ such as birth rate, death rate, infant mortality, 
child mortality, life expectancy, etc.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Given 
the ‘inputs’ for the two events, the model breaks down because of the 
incredible disparity in ‘outputs’ between the two events as the GLF 
death rate is 13.28x (16.6/1.25) worse than the SSJW death rate. How can
 the ‘outputs’ — in terms of the death rate — of the Great Leap Forward 
be 13.28x worse than the Second Sino-Japanese War given the 
overwhelmingly superior ‘inputs’ — in terms of length of railroads, food
 production, steel production, etc. — of the Great Leap Forward when 
compared to the Second Sino-Japanese War? This is physically impossible 
as proven mathematically using a ‘systems’ approach here.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Applying
 the death rate of the Second Sino-Japanese War to the three year period
 of the Great Leap Forward would give 3.75M (1.25×3) deaths due to 
economic deprivation during peacetime. This is the worst case scenario 
as economic deprivation during wartime should be a LOT worse than during
 peacetime. This ‘systems’ approach of modeling the two events — GLF and
 SSJW — validates my conclusion that the death rate must be in the 
millions not tens of millions as noted above. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Replies: <span><a href="#comment-4762474"><span>@Ron Unz</span></a></span></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

facts, evidences, pictures, video,…) about you to hurt your business or 
professionally, and with you totally unprepared and defenseless, his 
words become accepted in your community. Would you consider this to be a
 honorable strategy?</p> <p class="rm-manual">Sneak attack during war, 
however, is totally acceptable because both sides know they are enemy, 
and both sides understand sneak attack is one of the available strategic
 tool. In contrast, sneak attack among friends or even casual 
acquaintance maneuvering for advantage is not considered and should not 
be part of MO of the human relationship (from Chinese perspective). What
 the Japanese had done was considered 100% despicable by Chinese. And 
the worse is that many Japanese still don’t believe they had done wrong 
(sort of, but not entirely, mean justifies the end), and thus making us 
believing that they will do it again if given a chance.</p> <blockquote class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual">“…(or open announcing warnings)…”</p> </blockquote> <p class="rm-manual">The
 opening warnings serve as a way to allow the receiver to know that the 
relationship has been transitioning from a friendly/disinterested one to
 open hostility. It is a way to give both sides a chance to rescue the 
relationship, to avoid war, to seek political solution/negotiation, etc.
 Chinese issued so many warnings to US not to cross the 38 parallel in 
Korea, they were literally screaming aloud. Unfortunately, US was too 
arrogant and racist that millions had to die to learn the lesson. They 
did eventually learn not to cross the 17 parallel in Vietnam.</p> <blockquote class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual">“while utilizing advanced technological support like missile and air support…” </p> </blockquote> <p class="rm-manual">This
 is irrelevant – it is like blaming the hammer does not help you with 
the screw. Missile and air support could be as much a stabilizing tool 
if put in proper context. There are people who believe nuclear weapon / 
ICBM is the reason that prevent WW3, or at least prevent war between 
major powers. </p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 I concluded based on the population pyramid that the decline in the

leaving only millions not tens of millions of excess deaths.</p> </blockquote> <p class="rm-manual">Distinguishing
 between a large rise in infant mortality and a large decline in 
fertility is hardly trivial, at least by merely glancing at a population
 pyramid, and both those developments would surely occur during a huge 
famine. The GLF ran 1958-1962 and the pyramid comes from 1982, so 
offhand it looks to me like a substantial fraction of the children who 
were under 6 at the beginning of the GLF also “disappeared,” which 
obviously wouldn’t have been due to infertility issues. From what I 
remember, there were many thousands of reported cases of cannibalism in 
harder-hit areas, which also tends to be a good indicator of a horrific 
famine.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Frankly, I’d originally opened 
TOMBSTONE as something of a skeptic, but the 40 page chapter using a 
variety of different statistical methods to attempt to estimate the 
population losses of the GLF seemed pretty convincing. I’m curious 
whether you’ve actually read the book yourself and if so, why you found 
it so unpersuasive. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Replies: <span><a href="#comment-4762919"><span>@antibeast</span></a></span>, <span><a href="#comment-4763769"><span>@Patrick McNally</span></a></span></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 tell you my honest view of TOMBSTONE and other ‘research studies’ of a 
similar nature, I would say they are bunk because their ‘statistical 
evidence’ is highly suspect given the fact that Deng’s CCP conspired 
with Western propagandists to ‘demonize’ Mao by discrediting Maoist 
Communism. Their fatal flaw is ignoring the decline in birth rates while
 including tens of millions of ‘unborn children’ as excess deaths caused
 by economic deprivation during the Great Leap Forward. </p> <p class="rm-manual">I
 would rely more on people like Indian economist Amartya Sen, an expert 
on famines, who has studied ‘Communist China’ under Mao’s rule from 
1949-1976. Sen admitted that ‘Communist China’ outperformed ‘Democratic 
India’ throughout the ENTIRE period of Mao’s rule including the worst 
years of the Great Leap Forward. He noted wryly that if the West had 
applied the same criteria to India, then Indian leaders would easily win
 the morbid title of the “worst mass-murderers in history”. Here’s a 
graph showing the life expectancy of China vs India:</p> <p class="rm-manual">Note
 the huge increase in life expectancy in China which was 10+ more years 
than India AFTER the Great Leap Forward. This also validates my earlier 
‘systems’ model whereby increased factor inputs of railways, roads, 
dams, canals, steel mills, etc. also increased the standard of living 
outputs as expressed in life expectancy, birth rate, etc. AFTER the 
Great Leap Forward. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Again, my earlier 
‘systems’ model invalidates the ‘Great Famine’ hypothesis because 
peacetime deprivation during the Great Leap Forward could not have been 
6-13x WORSE than wartime deprivation during the Second Sino-Japanese 
War, given the much higher factor inputs during peacetime than at 
wartime. No matter how much the Western propagandists and their Chinese 
collaborators try to ‘demonize’ Mao by discrediting Maoist Communism, it
 is physically impossible that there could have been 6-13x more ‘excess 
deaths’ during the Great Leap Forward than during the Second 
Sino-Japanese War, given the much higher factor inputs in terms of 
railways, food production, steel mills, canals, dams, roads, etc. during
 peacetime than wartime. </p> <p class="rm-manual">In conclusion, 
something as tragic as a ‘Great Famine’ of that magnitude imputed by 
Western propagandists and their Chinese collaborators would have been 
accompanied by social unrest, cultural trauma and political instability,
 the kind of phenomena that would have resulted in the violent overthrow
 of ruling dynasties in Chinese history. To be sure, famines (with a 
small ‘f”) did occur regularly in China but they are localized events 
with limited impact on the rest of the population. Indeed, there were 
reported famines caused by floods and drought during that time period 
which coincided with but had nothing to do with the Great Leap Forward. 
Liu took advantage of those natural disasters to depose Mao as President
 of China in 1959. Other than those localized famines, a ‘Great Famine’ 
of the kind imagined by Western propagandists and their Chinese 
collaborators 3-4 decades later in the 80s and 90s simply didn’t happen 
in China, as reported by Western intelligence agencies, KMT agents, 
foreign journalists, Soviet advisers, Third World leaders, etc. during 
the Great Leap Forward. Here’s a banquet hosted by Mao in Beijing for 
his guests, Khrushchev and Ho, with Soong in 1959:</p><p class="rm-manual"><span>[MORE]</span></p><p class="rm-manual"> </p><p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/post/13367/throwback-thursday-the-man-who-cooked-for-mao" rel="nofollow">https://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/post/13367/throwback-thursday-the-man-who-cooked-for-mao</a></p> <p class="rm-manual">To paraphrase Mark Twain, the studies of a ‘Great Famine’ are greatly exaggerated. </p> <p class="rm-manual"></p><p class="rm-manual"></p><p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 can find some books which give the number 30,2 for 1913 instead of 
Lorimer’s 30.9. That has to do with the 11 other provinces which broke 
away from the USSR after 1917. Mortality was actually higher in the main
 Russian part of the Czarist Empire than in Finland, Poland or the 
Baltic.</p> <p class="rm-manual">For another comparison, some select years of the United States can be noted:</p> <p class="rm-manual">1913_____13.8</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1915_____13.2</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1940_____10.8</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1950_____9,6</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1951_____9.7</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1952_____9.6</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1953_____9.6</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1954_____9.2</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1955_____9.3</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1956_____9.4</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1957_____9.6</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">Those numbers come from Geiger &amp; Inkeles, Soviet Society: A Book of Readings.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Now
 with China the first printed source to give claims of mortality rates 
for the years following the revolutionary victory was the government 
itself. In the Statistical Yearbook of China 1986 we get the following 
list of alleged mortality rates per thousand annually:</p> <p class="rm-manual">1949_____20.00</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1950_____18.00</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1951_____17.80</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1952_____17.00</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1953_____14.00</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1954_____13.18</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1955_____12.28</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1956_____11.40</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1957_____10.80</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1958_____11.98</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1959_____14.59</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1960_____25.43</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1961_____14.24</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1962_____10.02</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1963_____10.04</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">These
 are huge underestimates. There’s no way that Chinese mortality could be
 as low 20/1000 in 1949 or 10.8/1000 in 1957. Judith Banister, China’s 
Changing Population, devised a new table in response to this:</p> <p class="rm-manual">1949_____38</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1950_____35</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1951_____32</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1952_____29</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1953_____25.77</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1954_____24.20</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1955_____22.33</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1956_____20.11</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1957_____18.12</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1958_____20.65</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1959_____22.06</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1960_____44.60</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1961_____23.01</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1962_____14.02</p><p class="rm-manual"> 1963_____13.81</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">Banister’s
 numbers are more realistic, while still conforming to the general 
pattern laid out in the official statistics. Both Banister and the 
government statistics show a remarkable drop in mortality attained by 
the revolutionary government in the years 1949-57. Banister is honest 
enough to credit the government for achieving this. Then as the Great 
Leap Forward was launched the statistics (both versions) show a rise in 
mortality which nonetheless remains clearly below the prerevolutionary 
mortality rates until 1960, when it spikes up sharply. By 1960 the party
 was already admitting that a lot of failures had occurred in the Great 
Leap Forward and was backing off of the more dramatic claims. So one has
 to wonder what was special about 1960 that would lead to such a spike 
in mortality.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Roderick MacFarquhar has addressed this:</p> <p class="rm-manual">“The
 most serious problem in 1960 was drought which in the spring and summer
 affected 600 million mou… Not surprisingly in view of the drought, most
 of the flooding had been due to the typhoons, more of which had hit the
 Chinese mainland than in any of the previous 50 years, 11 between June 
and October, and each typhoon had lasted longer than usual, averaging 
ten hours, the longest stretching to 20. Moreover, nature had played an 
additional trick. The typhoon did not strike north-westwards as usual, 
but northwards. This added to their impact because it meant there were 
no high mountains to ward them off, and that less rain reached the rest 
of the country. In the aftermath of the drought and floods came insect 
pests and plant diseases.”</p><p class="rm-manual"> — The Great Leap Forward, Volume 2 of The Origins of the Cultural Revolution, p. 322.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">So
 in the most objective sense we can say that the Great Leap Forward was a
 reckless project which was damaging to Chinese agriculture, but that 
the rise in mortality was well short of prerevolutionary death rates 
except in 1960 when a major natural disaster that had no direct 
connection with the Chinese government occurred. No the question is how 
do we assess what was the actual mortality to be ascribed to this chain 
of events.</p> <p class="rm-manual">What you should notice right away 
about liars like Jung Chang, Yang Jisheng et al is that they freely 
allow themselves to cite mortality numbers from inconsistent sources. If
 you use the official Chinese statistics which I gave above then these 
numbers imply that 3,36 million more people died in 1960 than if the 
mortality rate had remained what it was in 1949. At the same time the 
official table implies that about 15 million more died in 1958-61 than 
if mortality had remained at the level of 1957. Banister’s figures would
 imply 4.35 and 25 million respectively. But obviously one can only say 
that mortality in 1958 was higher than in 1957, not 1949. Actually, if 
you used the 1957 mortality rate for China as a benchmark for deciding 
what constitutes a famine then every single year on record for both 
prerevolutionary China as well Czarist Russia would be judged as a year 
of famine.</p> <p class="rm-manual">However liars like Chang and Jisheng
 go beyond that. They actually use the numbers from the Statistical 
Yearbook where it is convenient, then jump to other sources where that 
pays off better.</p> <p class="rm-manual">On pp. 408-8 Jisheng gives us 
alleged death rates which clearly come from the Statistical Yearbook. He
 uses them to deduce a “normal death rate” of 1.047 percent. But 
Banister makes it clear that a more realistic estimate for mortality as 
it was attained in 1957 was 18.12 per thousand. Moreover, Banister 
acknowledges that this was the result of an unprecedented drop in 
mortality attained by Mau in the period 1949-57. If one were to demand 
of Nicholas II that he should have attained a mortality rate of 1.047 
percent. By such standards 2/3 of all the deaths in Czarist Russia in 
the years 1899-1913 would be “artificial Holodomor” deaths since the 
mortality rate for 1913 was 30.9 per thousand.</p> <p class="rm-manual">But
 at least if Jisheng stuck to using the mortality as the Statistical 
Yearbook presents it then he would have claimed that the death rate for 
1960 was 25.43/1000. But no instead he now jumps over to the more 
realistic figures which (as per Banister) place it in the 40s. But 
obviously if you take an artificially lowered mortality estimate for 
1957, such as the 10.8 given in the Yearbook, and you combine with more 
realistic figures for 1960 and thereabouts, such as the 44.7 which 
Banister assigns to that year, then you will produce a fantastically 
inflated estimate. Hence the 40 million garbage which we hear about. </p> <p class="rm-manual"></p><p class="rm-manual"></p><p class="rm-manual"></p></li>
