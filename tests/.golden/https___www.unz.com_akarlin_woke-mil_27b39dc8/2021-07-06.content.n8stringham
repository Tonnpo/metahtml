<p><span>On paper, the US still has by far the world’s strongest 
military. This is the case whether or not you measure it by military 
spending, by various indices of military power (e.g. <a href="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/mei-2015/">MEU</a>, <a href="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/cap-2013/">CAP</a>, or the <a href="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/top-10-militaries-2015/">CMP</a> developed on this blog), or as pertains to the narrower if arguably more relevant naval sphere, by <a href="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/tracking-chinas-naval-power/">naval megatonnage</a> (even if the gap with China rapidly shrinks <a href="https://twitter.com/akarlin88/status/1329207441276477446">as the PLAN adds</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/akarlin88/status/1345742369388425223">the equivalent</a> of a major European Great Power navy every single year).</span></p>
<p><span>However, there are increasing reasons to think that large parts
 of this superiority could be becoming illusory – a dangerous state of 
affairs, given the recovery of <a href="https://www.unz.com/anepigone/team-america-world-police-social-worker/">bipartisan support</a> for US military intervention and American elites’ oft-stated confidence in their military supremacy.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of these reasons are well covered in the military/strategy
 sphere, such as those relating to issues of the technological 
convergence of Chinese and other potential adversaries’ weapons systems.
 The most hyped example are Russian/Chinese hypersonic weapons, though 
there are many more prosaic examples, ranging from progressive 
improvements in Chinese fighter engines to the <a href="https://www.unz.com/akarlin/iran-takes-3/">unexpected precision</a>
 of Iranian ballistic missiles. This is accompanied by US procurement 
failures, with the F-35 program being the most high-profile example. 
However, what has not been written as much about is the rapid 
degradation of the human capital component in the US military – a factor
 that is no less important than military capital or technological 
prowess.</span></p>
<p><span>Fundamentally, you need your military forces to be staffed with
 high IQ and well trained men with high morale and commitment to its 
cause.</span></p>
<p><span>High IQ is especially important in commanding positions and in the more “g loaded” services. According to <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w21372">a 2015 paper</a>
 by M.F. Cancian and M.W. Klein, it seems to have been going rapidly 
down even before the diversity drives of the 2010s. The cognitive 
performance of US Marine officers has seen a 10 IQ point decline between
 the 1980s and 2010.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is it looks like in terms of bell curves in 1980 and 2014.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, there has been an increase in physical 
fitness. But, good and aesthetic as fitness maxing is, brawn doesn’t do 
nearly as much for your combat effectiveness as brains. During WW2, 
American officers were Chad jocks who could outrun their platoons, while
 German officers <a href="https://www.quora.com/Were-US-Marines-tougher-than-elite-German-troops-in-WW2/answer/Joseph-Scott-13?ch=2&amp;share=f6d2d818&amp;srid=osVU">were nerds</a>
 who studied military history, weapon specs, and did just one hour of 
athletics per week. Consequently, German units were much more combat 
effective than American ones, with the best US Marine divisions only 
being equivalent to second-tier Wehrmacht ones. On the rare occasions 
that they were more or less evenly matched on the battlefield, with no 
American logistics or air power preponderance, the Germans almost always
 won.</span></p>
<p><span>This decline is systemic and probably unavoidable in so far as 
private sector salaries have become much more competitive relative to 
public sector salaries, including military ones. The attraction of 
military service as a civic and patriotic ideal has also declined. In 
academic terms, West Point is a decidedly middling school; it is not 
where the intellectual gifted go. In fairness, this problem is not 
unique to the US Armed Forces. There have been similar trends in the 
Russian Armed Forces, though I imagine China may be more buffered from 
this by the banal fact that it has just 2 million soldiers out of 1.4 
billion people. This should in principle allow China to be much more 
discerning in its selection criteria.</span></p>
<p><span>However, in the past few years, these long-standing trends in 
deteriorating human capital have been turbocharged by the rapid 
infiltration of Woke ideology into the American military. As late as 
2018, the Army <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2018/06/19/army-splits-west-point-tweeter-communism-will-win.html">discharged</a> “revolutionary socialist” Spencer Rapone from West Point for flashing “Communism Will Win” at his graduation.</span></p>
<p><span>But in retrospect, Rapone’s only problem may have been that he 
was just ahead of his time by a couple of years. Consider some of the 
following.</span></p>
<p><span>In September 2020, recommended reading courses at West Point <a href="https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1303721978314985472">included</a> classics of military theory such as “Critical Race Theory: An Introduction” and “A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory”.</span></p>
<p><span>In October 2020, the head of the Air Force recruiting division says <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardHanania/status/1322267622277226496">too many</a> pilots are white men and that increasing diversity is a war-fighting imperative.</span></p>
<p><span> Pentagon leaders didn’t need to explain the why, although Gen.
 David Goldfein, our former chief of staff, did that in calling 
diversity “a war-fighting imperative.” It’s been clear for some time 
that our progress in better reflecting the society we serve has been too
 slow.</span></p>
<p><span>Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the first 
African-American to lead any branch of the military, has called on us to
 accelerate change or risk losing ground to Russia and China, both of 
which are integrating potential game-changing technologies like 
artificial intelligence and hypersonic flight. We need both the best 
technologies and the best people to win. Improving our diversity falls 
squarely in Brown’s mandate. </span></p>
<p><span>In December 2020, apparently unsatisfied with the existing decline in officer IQs, the military <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardHanania/status/1341230228392136705">called for a</a> “a thorough review of DOD aptitude tests to ensure they do not adversely impact diversity.”</span></p>
<p><span>Note that up until now, this was all still under President 
Trump. One of Joe Biden’s first acts in office was to reverse the 
transgender ban in the military, heralding it by choosing <a href="https://twitter.com/starsandstripes/status/1326993419772723200">a transgender veteran</a> to be part of the transition team at the Department of Defense.</span></p>
<p><span>By February 2021, the US Navy <a href="https://twitter.com/USNavy/status/1364621119488163840">was recommending its sailors</a> read racial grievance grifter Ibram X. Kendi on “How To Be An Anti-Racist”:</span></p>
<p><span>… as well as other classics in the naval genre such as “Sexual Minorities and Politics” and “The New Jim Crow”.</span></p>
<p><span>Conspicuously missing: “The Influence of Sea Power Upon 
History” by Alfred Thayer Mahan, one of the most prominent naval 
theorists of all time. (The Chinese for their part are reading him).</span></p>
<p><span>BTW, how is this <a href="https://unz.com/akarlin/the-next-100-years-george-friedman-review/">for a “naval tradition” that</a> the Chinese will require decades to master, George S. Friedman?</span></p>
<p><span>Amusingly, the list does include Ghost Fleet, a sci-fi book in 
which China knocks out most of the US hi-tech weapons in a surprise 
attack and the US, through a series of deus ex machina, weasels its way 
back to victory with a combination of retrofitting mothballed 
rust-buckets with 3D printed weapons systems, Anonymous hackers, 
eccentric Silicon Valley oligarchs, and a color revolution in Moscow 
(perhaps all the Navalny supporters just couldn’t bear the thought of 
all the trauma that Chinese and Russian troops were inflicting on the 
bodies of Black transgender soldiers?).</span></p>
<p><span>There is already evidence that all these diversity initiatives are having a deleterious effect even in peacetime.</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, the USS John McCain was <a href="https://www.unz.com/isteve/the-feelz-police/#comment-1979362">apparently piloted</a> by one such diversity hire during its 2017 collision with a Liberian-flagged tanker:</span></p>
<p><span> Check out the bios of the CO and XO. The CO is Commander 
Alfredo Sanchez, native of Puerto Rico. He appears to be a washout from 
flight school, reassigned to duty as a surface officer.</span></p>
<p><span>The XO is named… Commander Jessie Sanchez, also a native of 
Puerto Rico. He started out as an enlisted sailor, then got a diploma 
from a diploma mill and was commissioned as a limited duty officer. This
 is not a typical bio of a XO of a destroyer, at least in my day. </span></p>
<p><span>Not to be deterred, the appropriately named USS John McCain 
continues to intrepidly venture forth, splitting its time between the 
Black Sea and the South China Sea.</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, even as all these SJW initiatives on racial 
diversity and transgenders get pushed into the military, the remaining 
rednecks and non-woke normies are getting policed by the Rainbow 
Commissars <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/02/04/exclusive-special-forces-warned-against-using-pepe-the-frog-iiiers-other-extremist-symbols/">for sporting</a> Pepe the Frog symbols.</span></p>
<p><span>Is it possible to arrest these trends? Probably not – as we see
 above, it was already in progress throughout the US Armed Forces for at
 least the past couple of years, including during a period when 
Republicans were ascendant. Moreover, it has its antecedents in the 
other Anglo-Saxon countries, having started off in Canada and progressed
 onto the UK from around 2015. A British military affairs watcher with 
whom I’ve occasionally exchanged emails presented the following timeline
 a couple of years ago:</span></p>
<p><span> Britain has gone from, in just 5 years, the ability to train, 
organize and deploy the highest quality brigade-level expeditionary 
forces in the world to having an eroded military now more focused on 
“wokeness” and “diversity” than combat capability. This decline is not 
an overnight, black and white phenomena, but appears intractable due to 
entrenched ideology. Britain now has “woke” Zampolits in the armed 
forces, the JEDIs (yes, seriously), the Joint Equality, Diversity and 
Inclusion unit. Canada – as a pioneer of military “wokeness” in the 
Anglo-Saxon countries – has had these for some time, but have increased 
in power and scope under Trudeau. Canadian Federal government offices 
even have “Positive Space Champions/Ambassadors”, equipped with rainbow 
lapel pins, to enforce/observe compliance with ideology around 
transgenderism, immigration, 2SLGBTQQIA+ and even climate change.</span></p>
<p><span>The Canadian case is less surprising as it clobbered it’s armed
 forces with politically correct ideology from around 1989/1990 onwards.
 The British case is far more extraordinary in it’s radical 
rearrangement of core ethos and human resources pipeline in such a short
 time and at such a rapid pace. Britain had stubbornly resisted attempts
 to alter it’s armed forces with such ideology until around 2015. </span></p>
<p><span>One might argue that this is not such a big deal for Canada 
since it doesn’t have any Great Power pretensions and is hardly going to
 go toe-to-toe with China anytime soon. However, the UK most certainly 
does retain imperial aspirations, if suborned to American ones – and yet
 it drank the Kool-Aid regardless. Since most social trends towards 
“liberalism” in the UK end up migrating across the Atlantic after a few 
years, that the US would follow shortly afterwards was close to 
inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span>And now that the Woke agenda has become the ideology of the US 
military, it will now seep down through various Atlancist institutions 
down to its vassals:</span></p>
<p>Diversity is our strength. </p>
<p><span>Retweet to join us in celebrating the differences that make us stronger 💪<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZeroDiscriminationDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ZeroDiscriminationDay</a> <a href="https://t.co/As4phmspXR">pic.twitter.com/As4phmspXR</a></span></p>
<p><span>— NATO (@NATO) <a href="https://twitter.com/NATO/status/1366355680681209859?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2021</a></span></p>
<p><span>The obvious historical parallel to such “political education” 
of the armed forces is the Red Army. This was very much to its detriment
 and led to millions of extra casualties and surrenders in 1941-42, 
before the facts of German atrocities and starvation of POWs – as well 
as a reversal away from Bolshevik agitprop back towards military 
traditionalism – increased morale and stiffened backbones. But even 
there, it was accompanied from extremely harsh military discipline from 
the get go, with several divisions’ worth of Soviet troops getting shot 
for cowardice, desertion, self-wounding, and the like during the course 
of the war. Meanwhile, more than a hundred US soldiers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pentagon-tbi-exclusive-idUSKBN2041ZK">claimed “brain injuries”</a>
 from being in a bunker while Iranian missiles rained down on them for a
 few minutes. Which is fine so long as military action remains to 
theatrics, as it did in January 2020, but how they would cope in a real 
war with a peer competitor who refrains from telegraphing in upcoming 
missile strikes is a different matter.</span></p>
<p><span>The whitepill in this, so far it is, is that all of this 
self-destructive activity might imply that the US is much less serious 
about fighting a Great Power than its public rhetoric lets on. Perhaps, 
if China was to take Taiwan during the early 2020s, the US will just 
growl and snarl in response, levy massive sanctions – but slink away 
from an open military confrontation.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, the defining thing about ideologues is that a
 lot of the time they really do drink their own Kool-Aid. Perhaps these 
days the top brass (if not its analysts) really do think that 
psychometric tests are social constructs and that diversity really does 
increase warfighting capacity. Or even if they do realize its hogwash 
they nonetheless keep quiet because the system has been promoting and 
selecting for toadies who don’t contradict their political masters. 
Aggressiveness married to hubris is always dangerous, and the US has no 
shortage of either, from George S. Friedman’s triumphalist rhetoric 
about “naval tradition” to US defense policy advisor Michele Flournoy’s 
powerful claims that the US has the ability <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3109852/harder-us-line-potential-pentagon-chief-floated-idea-sink-china">to sink all</a> Chinese vessels “within 72 hours” in the South China Sea.</span></p>
<p><span>But the nice thing about Wokeness is that even this has a silver lining:</span></p>
<p>The nice thing about the Great Awokening is that it crimps US capacity to fight imperialist wars. <a href="https://t.co/0hWIoxAM9C">pic.twitter.com/0hWIoxAM9C</a> </p>
<p><span>— 🇷🇺 ANATꙮLY 🤔 KARLIN (@akarlin88) <a href="https://twitter.com/akarlin88/status/1213068861429424128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2020</a></span></p>
<p><span>Crazed as a Woke US military might be, it will find it much 
more difficult to win its wars, especially in conjunction with existing 
trends with respect to decreasing officer IQ. By breaking down 
meritocracy and undermining esprit de corps, wokeness probably 
translates into another effective 5-10 point reduction in IQ so far as 
combat effectiveness is concerned. This is taking place at the same time
 that the technological gap relative to “near peer” adversaries (perhaps
 the “near” part will soon become redundant) is rapidly narrowing.</span></p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>Military defeat is one of the very few things that could decisively discredit the Woke ideology.</span></p>

 My service in the USMC Infantry straddled both Carter and Reagan. The 
military under Carter was in poor condition. Old weapons, old 782 gear, 
low standards for entry and most importantly, less training. That 
changed under Reagan, quickly. I'm not saying that was a good thing 
because Ron got foolish in Beirut and then compensated for his mistake 
with Grenada. Our officers were arrogant pricks but seemed smart enough.
 It is a good thing our military is getting weaker since it should 
reduce the amount of foreign misadventure. Replies: @gotmituns, @Marckus</p></span><p class="rm-manual"></p> </li>

 mind as well. The "Figure 1" graph would be more useful if it included 
the time period starting with the end of the draft in 1973. We know the

 Karlin Thanks for your articles - in the late 60s and early 70s the 
Vietnam war was being changed with the men, themselves, from E-6 down - 
waking up to the fact that - "we were fighting a Bull Shit war and we 
are tired of losing our buddy's ". Of course when you have cases of 
grenades everywhere - that got everybody's attention. - real fast . Fast
 forward a few years, and the Pentagon had to do some fast re thinking 
and renovations in regards to getting the free thinking soldiers - out 
of there. Todays military was engineered , in order to avoid this same 
scenario - my 2 rubles worth , anyways - Nam 70 -71. Spacibo</p></span>, <span><a href="#comment-4510198"><span>@Wilburn Sprayberry</span></a><p class="rm-manual">@Anatoly
 Karlin I was in the Army from 1975-86. The post-Vietnam, volunteer 
military was at a low ebb throughout the 70s, with bad morale 
(especially demoralized officers &amp; NCOs), poor discipline, worse 
readiness, continuing racial problems, &amp; declining percentages of 
enlistees who were high school graduates. Then came Reagan, an immediate
 15% pay raise for all ranks, &amp; soon after, the "Reagan recession" 
of 1981-83, which drove many unemployed but competent people into the 
military so they could have a relatively decent job. This caused a 
dramatic rise in the overall quality of enlistees. In the Army we had 
people with masters degrees in statistics enlisting in combat arms. All 
metrics of combat readiness rose...suddenly I had young white guys in my
 field artillery battery - not just mechanics, but 13B privates 
(cannoneers) - who could actually repair broke-dick vehicles - it was 
great! </p><p class="rm-manual">But that was long ago, before the

which is an ocean of isolation from any continental opposing force.

 Karlin Fair point, but most military officers weren't poised to become 
engineers/lawyers/doctors had they not gone into the military. Had they 
stayed private sector, they'd have been corporate managers, personnel 
supervisors, or non-guild technicians of various types. In other words, 
they'd have been the sort of people getting laid off in droves in the 
last dozen years. The all-in pay scales for military officers versus 
white-collar professionals may look comparable, but a big chunk of 
private-sector white-collar professionals are un- or under-employed, so 
an honest comparison would have to average in a lot of zero or low 
incomes to the private-sector side. Even worse for the military, their 
officers who would end up unemployed in the private sector kinda know 
it, so they stick to the military like limpet mines, meaning that the 
military disproportionately ends up with the lower tiers of the 
professional classes. The results of this adverse selection cycle is on

<p class="rm-manual">Annapolis has always had smarter cadets than West 
Point on average. it takes more intelligence to survive on water than on
 land, and it takes more intelligence to design and build water vessels 
and systems than land systems. also the Navy is a standing tradition, 
prestigious, and is in the Constitution, whereas having a standing army 
was never a US thing until after 1945. technically, it may still be 
unconstitutional for the Army and Marines to exist in their current 
form. the global political situation overrides that though.</p> <p class="rm-manual">that
 doesn’t mean the Army guys are dumb. or at least, they weren’t dumb. 
they’re getting dumb now though. i noticed the dumbness starting to 
creep into the enlisted guys in the 80s, but the officers struck me as 
smart. 130 wechsler seemed believable for them on average, or about 2 
steps smarter than enlisted troops, going by my interactions with Army 
and Navy officers in the 80s and 90s. my best friend’s dad was a Navy 
recruiter in the 80s and 90s and i went to West Point as a recruit in 
the 90s, but i decided to not join the Army after checking it out.</p> <p class="rm-manual">still,
 the dumbest an enlisted guy is allowed to be even today is about 96 
wechsler. so i would estimate that what’s happening is less smart guys 
on average and at the top. the generals today in particular are 
extremely unimpressive. part of that is due to politics becoming a 
factor at the colonel level and up. part of it is due to them just being
 less smart and less capable now than ever. smart guys avoid the

construction of aircraft and missiles is at the highest intelligence

don’t know for sure by how much. less than Navy and Army is my 
estimation. NASA on the other hand, a related government agency, has 
declined greatly, in their manned space mission capability, and cannot 
even function now. their SLS efforts are embarrassing.</p> <p class="rm-manual">despite
 all that, i am under the impression that in the current voluntary US

 Marines, and Air Force, the enlisted guys who kill the enemy, and the

makes up for the sharp decline among the rest of the forces. it won’t be
 able to make up for the decline of the average Navy personnel in the

they’d have been the sort of people getting laid off in droves in the

private-sector white-collar professionals are un- or under-employed, so 
an honest comparison would have to average in a lot of zero or low 
incomes to the private-sector side. Even worse for the military, their 
officers who would end up unemployed in the private sector kinda know 
it, so they stick to the military like limpet mines, meaning that the 
military disproportionately ends up with the lower tiers of the

 "Infamy" by John Toland explains the Pearl Harbor shtick. US 
codebreakers had broken the vaunted Japanese Purple Code several weeks 
before 12-7-41. Roosevelt, Admiral King and General Marshall all knew 
well beforehand the general outline of the Japanese attack strategy. 
They resolutely refused to allow General Short and Admiral Kimmel in on 
the dope. What was the reason? </p><p class="rm-manual">Led by the likes
 of Charles Lindbergh Jr., the America First movement was large and 
influential. As a body the American people did not want to get involved 
in another war, whether against the Germans in Europe or Asia versus the
 Japanese. This state of affairs presented a major stumbling block to 
the financier Cabal's plans to crush Germany, take Japan down a few 
notches and make the U$ the new hegemon in world affairs. That, of 
course, hinged on continued behind the scenes control over the U$ 
government by the financial elite's "Federal" Reserve Bank. </p><p class="rm-manual">Presenting
 a face of running the show, FDR desperately did all he could to aid 
Britain and eventually Soviet Russia through Lend-Lease and various 
other stratagems. The most egregious of those was to use American naval 
forces to escort convoys of merchant ships bringing war materiel to 
Britain. On the Asiatic front, the Grand Strategy involved the U$, 
Britain and the Dutch government in exile to cut off all oil and iron 
exports to the Japanese, who were, at that time, deeply involved in 
their invasion of China. How the hell you gonna make a major war of 
aggression in 20th Century terms without oil and steel? Impossible. </p><p class="rm-manual">
 The Asian strategy worked. The Germans failed to fall for the 
sucker-bait and strike back as the U$ naval forces depth-charging their 
U-Boats. By June of '41 Germany was drawn into a two-front war as they 
had invaded the Soviet Union. No way did they want to face America's 
industrial might and its military besides. So Roosevelt and Churchill 
employed the back-door route via the Japanese as those two nations had 
signed a mutual defense pact. Deprived of the materials to keep up their
 war on China, Japan desperately developed their plan of attack on Pearl
 Harbor. </p><p class="rm-manual"> With high casualties at Pearl Harbor 
that Sunday morning and with Battleship Row devastated, the American 
people were easily goaded into war-fever. Admiral Kimmel and General 
Short caught it in the shorts. Scapegoats were needed. They drew the 
short straw. Roosevelt, Churchill and the Rottenfeller and Rottenchild 
Crime Clans cutting the orders for those two smarmy prostiticians, got 
their war. </p><p class="rm-manual"> The truth about Pearl Harbor was all about politics up front and stealthy highest finance calling the shots.

 1. Japan’s escalating to a full scale war with China in 1937 was never 
planned. The bulk of IJA elite was in Manchuria planning for an 
operation against the Soviets comparable in size with Barbarossa 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantokuen </p><p class="rm-manual">2. If 
Japan had planned to invade China proper, the wise move was to follow 
the Manchu strategy, attack through Beijing-Wuhan and Beijing-Shanghai 
axis. The latter especially suitable for mechanized units. </p><p class="rm-manual">3.
 But Chiang followed advice from his German advisors, to draw Japan to 
the much less favorable terrain of Shanghai-Wuhan axis. </p><p class="rm-manual">4.
 After taking Shanghai in a bloodbath, Tokyo was content with occupying 
Manchuria and area near Shanghai, but the IJA hawks on ground kept 
moving forward expecting Chiang to surrender and get even bigger spoils.
 </p><p class="rm-manual">5. But they were wrong cause Chiang told the 
Japs fuck you after even losing capital Nanjing and Wuhan. And retreated
 further west to Chongqing </p><p class="rm-manual">6. By 1940 IJA was 
in quagmire and secretly considered retreating to Manchuria. But saw an 
opportunity when France fell in 6 weeks. This gave them an opening to 
invade Vietnam and cut off one of Chiang’s last supply routes. </p><p class="rm-manual">7.
 This is when US sanctions against Japan started, so bear in mind that 
previous whole 3 years US was Japan’s biggest materiel supplier in the 
China war </p><p class="rm-manual">8. Nomonhan Incident was a wake up 
call for IJA as they realized their armor and materiel was were clearly 
inferior to Soviets. So even as Guderian and Hoth were at the gates of 
Moscow, they declined requests from Hitler to join Barbarossa. </p><p class="rm-manual">9.
 Also, Japan was shocked to find when Germany had signed 
Molotov-Ribbentrop without telling them. Was shocked again when Germans 
launched Barbarossa without giving them heads up. </p><p class="rm-manual">10.
 So by this point Japan had only 2 options, either give all their 
conquests south of Manchuria*, or Nanshin-ron, i.e. strike first at US, 
UK and Dutch colonies </p><p class="rm-manual">*I don’t know this for 
sure, but I think FDR was deliberately ambiguous about whether Japan can
 keep Manchuria. This was non-negotiable as Manchukuo was a state within
 a state for the Kanto Army. Okamura Yasuji would later advise the KMT 
in the Liaoshen Campaign, and remarked </p><p class="rm-manual">宁可丢本土，不可丢满洲 „We can afford to lose the Home Islands before we can lose Manchuria." Replies: @Chinaman</p><p class="rm-manual"></p></span><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 It is an understandable thing. Ethnic Han have composed the majority of
 the Taiwanese population for centuries. Understandably mainland China 
does not want a gigantic aircraft carrier just off its coast. The U.S. 
did not want Cuba to be such and was willing to go to the brink of 
nuclear war to prevent it. The U.S. conquered and kept the non-co-ethnic
 lands of Northern Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii; and it destroyed a 
region of its own that seceded. China reclaiming Taiwan would be far

<p class="rm-manual">The US military is far worse than even Mr Karlin’s 
pessimistic take. Without doxing myself I can tell you some very 
negative things that go unreported about the military. </p> <p class="rm-manual">1.Much
 of the heavy equipment is non functional. The trucks, artillery pieces,
 apcs, heavy weapons, etc have not been getting replaced. Maybe for an 
average armored unit 30-40% of the vehicles could operate sustained 
operations. </p> <p class="rm-manual">2. Female integration into combat 
units has led to many instructors for initial entry training to be 
replaced by women who have no experience in the field. As a result the 
red blooded men are receiving poor instruction on how to actually fight.
 If they receive instruction at all.</p> <p class="rm-manual">3. Command
 is largely oblivious to the fact the men are receiving poor quality 
training and equipment. They disbelieve or frankly do not care about 
actual combat operations. I would say 80% of organizational focus is 
simply SHARP (sexual harassment complaints) and EO (equal opportunity) </p> <p class="rm-manual">I
 could write more but this could quickly become 20-30 bullets of major 
issues I ve seen in the US military. Issues, no significant officer 
seems to realize. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Agree: <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=GomezAdddams">GomezAdddams</a></p>

 gui zi Something I noticed about the invasion of Iraq in '03 is that 
the Marine Corp did the bulk of the fighting whereas the 4th and 7th 
Armies did mostly mop up and support. I think one of these armies never 
made it into the theater because the Turks would not let them pass 
through Turkey. I always thought this suggested that the Marine Corp was
 combat capable whereas the conventional army was not.</p></span><p class="rm-manual"></p> </li>

 you to behave in a certain way, to act and think in a prescribed

<p class="rm-manual">The wokening of the US military is one massive 
ongoing experiment. It is Tikkun Olam in action. Just like the Plandemic

 Armed Forces from their very inception were highly Masonic, just think 
for 33 degree George Washington, or Lafayette. Of course the entire 
“revolution” was really just a masonic rebellion and take over, but that
 is not the point here. The Airforce, and later NASA, are little more 
than giant freemason lodges. The latest evidence comes from the “murder”
 of senior airman and devout throupler Ashli Babbit.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Freemasonry
 is just Kabbala and Baphomet worship for goyim. Baphomet is of course 
the ultimate “woke” god, representing all 
androgyne/bisexual/bestiality/pedophilic perversions in one. But not 
only does having a “woke” gay-disco army help promote Baphomet and 
Kabbalism directly, it also provides the loyal cadre necessary to 
enforce the woke world order, or as they are sugar coating it now as, 
“the great reset”.</p> <p class="rm-manual">This queer military is far 
more about enforcing perversion and the transformation of the US into 
Sodom and Gomorrah than it is about “defending” the “US”. The globalist 
take over is complete anyway, the tech industry has created an 
electronic control matrix all across the planet. China, wittingly or 
unwittingly, has ensnared its self in this kabbala spider web.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 modern military really isn’t about noble foot soldiers duking it out 
with fire arms anyway. Drones, underwater drones, drone tanks, stealth 
drones, and swarms of drones, don’t require valiant and honest soldiers.
 Loyal and trigger happy porn addicted sadistic gay disco voyeurs spying

does not want a gigantic aircraft carrier just off its coast. The U.S.

nuclear war to prevent it. The U.S. conquered and kept the non-co-ethnic

 A gigantic aircraft carrier is no threat to China especially close to 
their coast. Carriers are done. Any built after the nimitz class are a 
total waste, meaning the Ford class, along with the F35. Plus, as 
Anatoly said, we don't posses the MANpower to man carriers and 
squadrons. In 76, between hangar deck and the roof, Nimitz routinely 
sailed with 8 squadrons 100 aircraft, big planes, F14s and A6 Intruders.
 My first cruise we also carried 3 or 4 Vigilante recon planes. And 6000
 total crew. The planes were big bastards. Because we can't MAN them 
anymore they only carry 65 or 70. With worse range and fewer refuelling 
assets than in the 70s through 80s, NAVAIR is vastly outgunned with 
current-state F18s at sea. Throw in China/Russia/Iran defensive missiles
 and you can see why carriers are toast. But Anatoly is most correct 
about MANpower. When you add in the hideous personnel issues, homos and

<p class="rm-manual">I’m one of those high IQ types who got out of the 
USMC in 1985. Besides having undiagnosed severe PTSD (which eventually 
disabled me) and being pissed off at everything, there were 2 main areas
 of issues that caused me to quit.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I wasn’t 
going to be responsible for the well-being of loyal, hard working 
people, who were being treated like disposable cannon fodder while 
billions were spent on ridiculous weapon systems.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 technically talented were spread way too thin, and were being set up 
for failure, and when they eventually make that mistake, they are 
crucified, not the brass that made the policies that set them up for 
failure.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Read the reports on fatal accidents in
 the military – especially friendly fire accidents. Too often there is 
some poor sucker who is spread too thin to do well at what they are 
doing, makes a fatal mistake in where to cut corners, and then is 
scapegoated for that.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Yes, there are some 
amazing high-tech weapons systems. And it takes an amazingly bright and 
talented person to fully leverage those systems. Without that talented 
person, those amazing high-tech systems are junk and money down the 
drain. It also takes very talented people to maintain those systems.</p> <p class="rm-manual">So
 draw a graph – the complexity of weapon systems is going up, while the 
IQ is going down – extrapolate that out, and predict the results.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Then
 there is the issue that much of the high-tech stuff doesn’t actually 
work well in the field because they were designed by eggheads who didn’t
 understand the real world.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I joined to defend democracy, not defend the profits of billionaires.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I have no talent for skating thru corrupt systems, full of predators who are looking for scapegoats, so I got out.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Recently
 I realized that I probably would have ended up being one of those 
would-be whistleblowers who gets assassinated. So all in all, its good I
 got out.</p> <p class="rm-manual">What really pisses me off now is how 
many people are so badly chewed up by that corrupt military system that 
they kill themselves, and the fucking hypocrites just ignore this. I 
suppose this is another graph that is going to get lots worse. Graph 
using idealism as a recruiting gimmick, against an increasingly corrupt 
and incompetent system.</p> <p class="rm-manual">In general the idea of 
the collapse of wokeness (after a major military defeat) and collapse of
 the empire sounds like a good idea to me. One of the writers on Unz 
said “Make America Ordinary Again”. That sounds fine to me. I like 
things like a big potluck of friends and family at the park on a summer 
day.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The tricky part is that when psychopaths 
are forced to see reality and let go of their illusions, they often have
 psychotic breaks, and these psychopaths are heavily armed with nuclear 
weapons. Putin’s big challenge is to avoid a nuclear war while the US is
 collapsing in on itself, and keep avoiding that war until after all of 
the nuclear weapons in the US have become nonfunctional due to lack of 
parts and competent maintenance. This could take a long time. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Agree: <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=Bert">Bert</a>, <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=animalogic">animalogic</a></p>

 I don’t think that the current stock of nukes would be enough to 
destroy all military assets of a peer or near peer power like Russia or 
China. It would also seriously damage industrial capabilities in both 
belligerents. Therefore, the war would then continue with whatever 
assets and forces there remain after the initial nuclear strikes, which 
would be the majority of the peacetime forces. And then the war would be
 decided by them, plus whatever the remaining and reorganized 
manufacturing would be able to produce and forces organized after that. 
In general I doubt that the units organized in wartime would be better 
than whatever existed in peacetime. Replies: @128</p></span><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

that. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Replies: <span><a href="#comment-4508869"><span>@Bert</span></a></span></p><p class="rm-manual">@Anatoly Karlin</p><blockquote class="rm-manual"> Well, the French had played a crucial role in helping the Americans achieve independence from the Brits </blockquote>A
 role yes, but any claim of crucial is dubious. The most important 
contributions were materiel and France's attempt to wrest away British 
colonies in the West Indies and India, such that British forces were 
tied down there. In actual fighting in the rebellious colonies France 
contributed little. In 1779 a Franco-American attempt to recapture 
Savannah was a disaster because d'Estaing impatiently ordered a frontal 
assault on the British fortifications and thereby caused very high 
American casualties. The French force landed in Rhode Island in 1780 did
 little until Washington utilized it for the siege at Yorktown. 
Cornwallis was in the vulnerable position at Yorktown because he had 
been chewed up by the Scots-Irish militia (and relatively fewer 
Continentals) in the Carolinas and went to Virginia to join a British 
force there to reorganize. The French West Indian fleet did block the 
British from carrying out an evacuation by sea, an important 
contribution of course. The fact is that the British never successfully 
held any part of the countryside and were cooped up in New York, 
Charlestown, and Savannah. Their only attempt to establish outposts in 
the hinterland was in South Carolina, and that attempt was defeated 
mostly by militia, with the aid of relatively few Continental troops, in
 1780 and 1781. With the size of the British force sent and the infantry
 tactics employed, Britain never had a chance to subdue the revolt. When
 the British realized that they couldn't send out foraging parties 
successfully, they should have given up and negotiated. Maybe they could
 have obtained some expansion of Florida or Canada that way.<p class="rm-manual"></p>, <span><a href="#comment-4509435"><span>@Thorfinnsson</span></a><p class="rm-manual">@Anatoly

of the state (or feudal lord) it served and ideology or religion it 
professed, was the premier military force in Europe for most of a

the Republic and First Empire. He was also served by able and innovative
 soldiers such as Vauban who were considered the foremost military minds
 of the world. </p><p class="rm-manual">The French language informs the

 You heard right ! The South African military was feared even by the 
Russian, Cuban and East German forces opposing them. Why ? Because SA 
black troops were trained and led by whites and fought beside whites. 
Even those black Angolans who fought the Portuguese, were already 
experienced and battle hardened and were inducted into the SA army were 
retrained to SA standards. The SA paratrooper and Special Forces courses
 were the most demanding and exhausting anywhere testing the limitations
 and endurance of even former British and American military who joined 
up. Rhodesians, already experienced from their struggle also brought a 
lot of experience to bear in SA. 32 Battalion was particularly fearsome 
and ruthless. To this day black/white South African combinations working
 as free lancers still rule the roost with Government contracts from 
other African countries unable to cope with problems in their own 
countries Mozambique being the latest. Today the SA military, blacks led
 by blacks is SHIT. So are the military in other African countries. What
 a surprise ! That's why Black militia here in the US, fully decked out

 role yes, but any claim of crucial is dubious. The most important 
contributions were materiel and France’s attempt to wrest away British 
colonies in the West Indies and India, such that British forces were 
tied down there.</p> <p>In actual fighting in the rebellious colonies 
France contributed little. In 1779 a Franco-American attempt to 
recapture Savannah was a disaster because d’Estaing impatiently ordered a
 frontal assault on the British fortifications and thereby caused very 
high American casualties. The French force landed in Rhode Island in 
1780 did little until Washington utilized it for the siege at Yorktown. 
Cornwallis was in the vulnerable position at Yorktown because he had 
been chewed up by the Scots-Irish militia (and relatively fewer 
Continentals) in the Carolinas and went to Virginia to join a British 
force there to reorganize. The French West Indian fleet did block the 
British from carrying out an evacuation by sea, an important 
contribution of course.</p> <p>The fact is that the British never 
successfully held any part of the countryside and were cooped up in New 
York, Charlestown, and Savannah. Their only attempt to establish 
outposts in the hinterland was in South Carolina, and that attempt was 
defeated mostly by militia, with the aid of relatively few Continental 
troops, in 1780 and 1781. With the size of the British force sent and 
the infantry tactics employed, Britain never had a chance to subdue the 
revolt. When the British realized that they couldn’t send out foraging 
parties successfully, they should have given up and negotiated. Maybe 
they could have obtained some expansion of Florida or Canada that way. </p> <p></p></li>

 My service in the USMC Infantry straddled both Carter and Reagan. The 
military under Carter was in poor condition. Old weapons, old 782 gear, 
low standards for entry and most importantly, less training. That 
changed under Reagan, quickly. I'm not saying that was a good thing 
because Ron got foolish in Beirut and then compensated for his mistake 
with Grenada. Our officers were arrogant pricks but seemed smart enough.
 It is a good thing our military is getting weaker since it should 
reduce the amount of foreign misadventure. Replies: @gotmituns, @Marckus</p></span><p class="rm-manual">Its

 You heard right ! The South African military was feared even by the 
Russian, Cuban and East German forces opposing them. Why ? Because SA 
black troops were trained and led by whites and fought beside whites. 
Even those black Angolans who fought the Portuguese, were already 
experienced and battle hardened and were inducted into the SA army were 
retrained to SA standards. The SA paratrooper and Special Forces courses
 were the most demanding and exhausting anywhere testing the limitations
 and endurance of even former British and American military who joined 
up. Rhodesians, already experienced from their struggle also brought a 
lot of experience to bear in SA. 32 Battalion was particularly fearsome 
and ruthless. To this day black/white South African combinations working
 as free lancers still rule the roost with Government contracts from 
other African countries unable to cope with problems in their own 
countries Mozambique being the latest. Today the SA military, blacks led
 by blacks is SHIT. So are the military in other African countries. What
 a surprise ! That's why Black militia here in the US, fully decked out 
and marching, are a clown show and joke. You can expect them to flee 
back to the hood when things get exciting especially against whites !

 Inducted blacks were not from the upper third of the intelligence

already experienced (although in a rag tag way) , some guerrilla 
deserters and others recruited for their language skills and 
pre-military experience living in the bush. </p><p class="rm-manual">The
 effectiveness of white led black troops was the result of merciless 
discipline and training and ability to live in the field without 
helicopter supply, a la Viet Nam of cold beer, hot pizza, Thanksgiving 
Turkey and cranberry sauce and stuffing. Severe beatings/ punishment 
were frequent when mistakes were made and live fire training was common 
with troopers trained to the extent they ignored close misses. Even 
Russian and East German trainers despaired over the quality of their 
students. Not so the SA Military. </p><p class="rm-manual">I also think 
though that the black man (training aside) was stiffened especially in 
particularly adverse situtions by whites (racist as they were supposed 
to be) who were prepared to die alongside them. </p><p class="rm-manual">I
 understand that Cuban troops who served in that theatre later 
implemented many of the training techniques used by the SA Army and some
 of their own. For example, in live fire training the trainee had to 
move from point A to B to C within certain time frames usually over 
difficult terrain/ obstacles. A machine gunner would dust down Point A, 
then Point B at times when the trainee should have moved on and was not 
supposed to be there. Too bad if Jose or Paco had not struggled forward 
with their load. </p><p class="rm-manual">The US Military encountered

 Shopper I think the Ottomans actually engaged in serious reform before.
 It was just that so many things had to be changed that it was 
impossible all at the same time. </p><p class="rm-manual">After the 
defeat at Vienna they lost so much that within a few years the 
Christians were close to Constantinople. But then they managed to turn 
the tide and pushed back the Christians, so that the actual territorial 
losses were not so large. </p><p class="rm-manual">They also remained a 
strong power, their subsequent wars with the Habsburgs (and increasingly
 the Russians) were fought with mixed success, basically defeats 
followed by victories, and so the decline took a very long time. </p><p class="rm-manual">Roughly
 a century after the war the Ottomans got so weak that on their own they
 were too weak to defeat any Christian power. That’s when they started 
needing outside help. But I wouldn’t describe it as playing others 
against each other, they survived as a result of tensions between the 
Christian powers, but it didn’t really have anything to do with some 
masterful Ottoman diplomacy, it just happened outside their influence. </p><p class="rm-manual">The
 very biggest difference between the post-Vienna Ottomans and the US 
after a hypothetical defeat is that the Ottomans were a premodern empire
 with no printing presses, so the elites could just keep the masses 
down, and the decline wasn’t even that obvious for someone living in the
 central provinces of the empire. They didn’t know how much more 
developed the Christians were. </p><p class="rm-manual">So I’m not sure 
if that could happen in the age of the mobile internet. Possible, but I 
tend to think that the ideology would be at least partly discredited.

 That’s a good point. It means that wokism won’t just have a corrosive 
effect on society and the economy, but it will simultaneously erode the 
military power. And not just indirectly, by increasing the cost of 
maintaining it (diversity requirements for the suppliers etc.), but also
 directly. But it also makes it more difficult to keep wokism in 
civilian life in the event of a military reform. So either wokism gets 
partly or fully rolled back or the military won’t get stronger even 
after serious defeats.</p></span><p class="rm-manual"></p> </li>

private sector salaries which are more lucrative than military salaries,
 but simply, all jobs in the plethora of government controlled 
activities which are afforded greater political and social value, e.g. 
You are considered more valuable as an indoctrinated teacher or 
professor than as a member of today’s military. And, of course, do not 
forget “diversity” employment. Consequently, I would change your

Those are far and few even today. Generally, most were already 
experienced (although in a rag tag way) , some guerrilla deserters and 
others recruited for their language skills and pre-military experience 
living in the bush.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The effectiveness of white 
led black troops was the result of merciless discipline and training and
 ability to live in the field without helicopter supply, a la Viet Nam 
of cold beer, hot pizza, Thanksgiving Turkey and cranberry sauce and 
stuffing. Severe beatings/ punishment were frequent when mistakes were 
made and live fire training was common with troopers trained to the 
extent they ignored close misses. Even Russian and East German trainers 
despaired over the quality of their students. Not so the SA Military.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I
 also think though that the black man (training aside) was stiffened 
especially in particularly adverse situtions by whites (racist as they 
were supposed to be) who were prepared to die alongside them. </p> <p class="rm-manual">I
 understand that Cuban troops who served in that theatre later 
implemented many of the training techniques used by the SA Army and some
 of their own. For example, in live fire training the trainee had to 
move from point A to B to C within certain time frames usually over 
difficult terrain/ obstacles. A machine gunner would dust down Point A, 
then Point B at times when the trainee should have moved on and was not 
supposed to be there. Too bad if Jose or Paco had not struggled forward 
with their load.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The US Military encountered 
some of these individuals in Grenada and commented on their (The Cubans)
 extraordinary military ability. </p> <p class="rm-manual">The US 
military better stop dicking around and get back to Viet Nam and pre-Nam
 training or we are going to be at a disadvantage in any major conflict.

 You are probably correct, but still you would need several warheads to 
destroy Beijing. I was also assuming a large warhead, most warheads are 
smaller. The US also needs to think about Russia. For Russia it might be
 smart to just evacuate the big cities and then launch the missiles to 
America. Anyway the Americans have to plan for that, so they cannot even
 use all of their nukes against China. </p><p class="rm-manual">The 
important thing is that China as a political entity would remain (even 
killing all urbanites would leave you with a population double that of 
America...), and probably you wouldn’t be able to destroy even the urban
 population. You also don’t know how many warheads or missiles the 
Chinese actually do have, because of the very large (uninspected) 
plutonium stockpiles they have.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 Does anyone even now know the truth of Pearl Harbour? Roosevelt had the
 Tokyo-Berlin decrypts in front of him saying that a conflict might very
 soon ("sooner than anyone expects") break out between Japan and the US,
 yet there don't seem to have been any precautions taken to prevent the 
attack. </p><p class="rm-manual">Did he WANT a naval disaster? Seems

 by John Toland explains the Pearl Harbor shtick. US codebreakers had 
broken the vaunted Japanese Purple Code several weeks before 12-7-41. 
Roosevelt, Admiral King and General Marshall all knew well beforehand 
the general outline of the Japanese attack strategy. They resolutely 
refused to allow General Short and Admiral Kimmel in on the dope. What 
was the reason?</p> <p class="rm-manual">Led by the likes of Charles 
Lindbergh Jr., the America First movement was large and influential. As a
 body the American people did not want to get involved in another war, 
whether against the Germans in Europe or Asia versus the Japanese. This 
state of affairs presented a major stumbling block to the financier 
Cabal’s plans to crush Germany, take Japan down a few notches and make 
the U$ the new hegemon in world affairs. That, of course, hinged on 
continued behind the scenes control over the U$ government by the 
financial elite’s “Federal” Reserve Bank.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Presenting
 a face of running the show, FDR desperately did all he could to aid 
Britain and eventually Soviet Russia through Lend-Lease and various 
other stratagems. The most egregious of those was to use American naval 
forces to escort convoys of merchant ships bringing war materiel to 
Britain. On the Asiatic front, the Grand Strategy involved the U$, 
Britain and the Dutch government in exile to cut off all oil and iron 
exports to the Japanese, who were, at that time, deeply involved in 
their invasion of China. How the hell you gonna make a major war of 
aggression in 20th Century terms without oil and steel? Impossible.</p> <p class="rm-manual">
 The Asian strategy worked. The Germans failed to fall for the 
sucker-bait and strike back as the U$ naval forces depth-charging their 
U-Boats. By June of ’41 Germany was drawn into a two-front war as they 
had invaded the Soviet Union. No way did they want to face America’s 
industrial might and its military besides. So Roosevelt and Churchill 
employed the back-door route via the Japanese as those two nations had 
signed a mutual defense pact. Deprived of the materials to keep up their
 war on China, Japan desperately developed their plan of attack on Pearl
 Harbor.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> With high casualties at Pearl Harbor 
that Sunday morning and with Battleship Row devastated, the American 
people were easily goaded into war-fever. Admiral Kimmel and General 
Short caught it in the shorts. Scapegoats were needed. They drew the 
short straw. Roosevelt, Churchill and the Rottenfeller and Rottenchild 
Crime Clans cutting the orders for those two smarmy prostiticians, got 
their war. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> The truth about Pearl Harbor was all about politics up front and stealthy highest finance calling the shots. </p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Thanks: <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=Mark+G.">Mark G.</a></p><p class="rm-manual"> • Replies: <span><a href="#comment-4510573"><span>@Alfa158</span></a></span></p><p class="rm-manual">@Majority
 of One I would agree with almost all of that, but it is not really 
established that the US knew there would be a surprise attack 
specifically on Pearl Harbor. The Purple Code that was broken was a 
diplomatic code and contained no details on the movements or plans of 
military assets. The traffic basically said that Japan was going to make
 one last effort to break the blockade and sanctions diplomatically and 
if that failed it would mean war. </p><p class="rm-manual">The Japanese 
fleet had disappeared from view several weeks prior and was training in 
the extreme northern islands of Japan. When they sailed for Pearl Harbor
 they took a route that evaded commercial shipping, observed strict 
radio silence and kept garbage on board the ships so any patrols would 
spot it floating in their wake. </p><p class="rm-manual">The US military
 and government was aware that something was up, but thought if there 
was a surprise attack it would be conducted closer to Japan against 
someplace like the Philippines. </p><p class="rm-manual">For the 
purposes of the Crime Clans getting the US into WW2, it really was 
largely irrelevant how devastating a surprise attack would be or which 
base was struck, the specific details weren’t that important. They just 
needed an attack to draw the US in. It was a bonus for them that Germany
 foolishly honored their mutual defense treaty with Japan and declared 
war on the US. </p><p class="rm-manual">The US Navy sent the carriers 
and their escorts out to sea on a combination training mission and sweep
 to see if the Japanese fleet was anywhere in the area, but the Japanese
 made sure to approach Pearl Harbor from the least expected direction. </p><p class="rm-manual">When
 the code breakers reported that the Japanese embassy had orders to burn
 their papers they actually tried to send messages to their bases 
including Pearl Harbor. Because of atmospheric radio conditions, the 
transmission by radio didn’t work and Washington used the Western Union 
cable to send coded telegrams that weren’t decoded and delivered to 
Kimmel until after the attacks. </p><p class="rm-manual">The US lucked 
out by having out to sea the ships that it turned out would be most 
important for fighting WW2 ; the carriers and their escorting cruisers 
and destroyers. As shocking as the spectacle of the devastation and loss
 of life was, all the Japanese accomplished was to blow up the US Navy’s
 meticulously preserved collection of charming but obsolete WW1 
battleships. The oil supplies and repair facilities mostly survived 
because the Japanese became concerned that the missing carriers might be
 stalking them and Ozawa called off follow ups attacks. It was like Ford
 trying to cripple Chevrolet’s ability to sell cars by blowing up the 
classic Corvette museum in Bowling Green. </p><p class="rm-manual">The 
lightening advances of the Japanese during the first six months of the 
war were not due to the loss of the battleships, but because the 
Japanese Army Navy and Air Forces had superiority in numbers, training, 
morale, technology and weapons systems. The US knew it was unprepared 
and that a war was planned so when the war broke out the design and 
building of the new ships, aircraft and weapons that would win the war 
was already underway. That was why the Essex carriers, fast battleships,
 Avengers, Hellcats, P-38’s, P-47’s, B-24’s and so forth entered service
 within only a couple of years of Pearl Harbor.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

Germans had was that the Wehrmacht and supply chain was never fully

decided that a fully mechanized military was not worth the effort.

 Does anyone even now know the truth of Pearl Harbour? Roosevelt had the
 Tokyo-Berlin decrypts in front of him saying that a conflict might very
 soon ("sooner than anyone expects") break out between Japan and the US,
 yet there don't seem to have been any precautions taken to prevent the 
attack. </p><p class="rm-manual">Did he WANT a naval disaster? Seems 
unlikely, a much smaller loss would still have brought the US into the 
war - as it was, the entire Pacific was lost - for a few months.

 Japan’s escalating to a full scale war with China in 1937 was never 
planned. The bulk of IJA elite was in Manchuria planning for an 
operation against the Soviets comparable in size with Barbarossa <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantokuen" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantokuen</a></p> <p class="rm-manual">2.
 If Japan had planned to invade China proper, the wise move was to 
follow the Manchu strategy, attack through Beijing-Wuhan and 
Beijing-Shanghai axis. The latter especially suitable for mechanized 
units.</p> <p class="rm-manual">3. But Chiang followed advice from his German advisors, to draw Japan to the much less favorable terrain of Shanghai-Wuhan axis.</p> <p class="rm-manual">4.
 After taking Shanghai in a bloodbath, Tokyo was content with occupying 
Manchuria and area near Shanghai, but the IJA hawks on ground kept 
moving forward expecting Chiang to surrender and get even bigger spoils.</p> <p class="rm-manual">5.
 But they were wrong cause Chiang told the Japs fuck you after even 
losing capital Nanjing and Wuhan. And retreated further west to 
Chongqing</p> <p class="rm-manual">6. By 1940 IJA was in quagmire and 
secretly considered retreating to Manchuria. But saw an opportunity when
 France fell in 6 weeks. This gave them an opening to invade Vietnam and
 cut off one of Chiang’s last supply routes.</p> <p class="rm-manual">7.
 This is when US sanctions against Japan started, so bear in mind that 
previous whole 3 years US was Japan’s biggest materiel supplier in the 
China war</p> <p class="rm-manual">8. Nomonhan Incident was a wake up 
call for IJA as they realized their armor and materiel was were clearly 
inferior to Soviets. So even as Guderian and Hoth were at the gates of 
Moscow, they declined requests from Hitler to join Barbarossa. </p> <p class="rm-manual">9.
 Also, Japan was shocked to find when Germany had signed 
Molotov-Ribbentrop without telling them. Was shocked again when Germans 
launched Barbarossa without giving them heads up. </p> <p class="rm-manual">10.
 So by this point Japan had only 2 options, either give all their 
conquests south of Manchuria*, or Nanshin-ron, i.e. strike first at US, 
UK and Dutch colonies</p> <p class="rm-manual">*I don’t know this for 
sure, but I think FDR was deliberately ambiguous about whether Japan can
 keep Manchuria. This was non-negotiable as Manchukuo was a state within
 a state for the Kanto Army. Okamura Yasuji would later advise the KMT 
in the Liaoshen Campaign, and remarked</p><p class="rm-manual"> 宁可丢本土，不可丢满洲 „We can afford to lose the Home Islands before we can lose Manchuria.” </p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual"> • Thanks: <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=Chinaman">Chinaman</a>, <a href="file:///comments/all/?commenterfilter=YetAnotherAnon">YetAnotherAnon</a></p><p class="rm-manual"> • Replies: <span><a href="#comment-4509918"><span>@Chinaman</span></a></span></p><p class="rm-manual">@China Japan and Korea Bromance of Three Kingdoms Let me ask you this. </p><p class="rm-manual">We

 1. Japan’s escalating to a full scale war with China in 1937 was never 
planned. The bulk of IJA elite was in Manchuria planning for an 
operation against the Soviets comparable in size with Barbarossa 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantokuen </p><p class="rm-manual">2. If 
Japan had planned to invade China proper, the wise move was to follow 
the Manchu strategy, attack through Beijing-Wuhan and Beijing-Shanghai 
axis. The latter especially suitable for mechanized units. </p><p class="rm-manual">3.
 But Chiang followed advice from his German advisors, to draw Japan to 
the much less favorable terrain of Shanghai-Wuhan axis. </p><p class="rm-manual">4.
 After taking Shanghai in a bloodbath, Tokyo was content with occupying 
Manchuria and area near Shanghai, but the IJA hawks on ground kept 
moving forward expecting Chiang to surrender and get even bigger spoils.
 </p><p class="rm-manual">5. But they were wrong cause Chiang told the 
Japs fuck you after even losing capital Nanjing and Wuhan. And retreated
 further west to Chongqing </p><p class="rm-manual">6. By 1940 IJA was 
in quagmire and secretly considered retreating to Manchuria. But saw an 
opportunity when France fell in 6 weeks. This gave them an opening to 
invade Vietnam and cut off one of Chiang’s last supply routes. </p><p class="rm-manual">7.
 This is when US sanctions against Japan started, so bear in mind that 
previous whole 3 years US was Japan’s biggest materiel supplier in the 
China war </p><p class="rm-manual">8. Nomonhan Incident was a wake up 
call for IJA as they realized their armor and materiel was were clearly 
inferior to Soviets. So even as Guderian and Hoth were at the gates of 
Moscow, they declined requests from Hitler to join Barbarossa. </p><p class="rm-manual">9.
 Also, Japan was shocked to find when Germany had signed 
Molotov-Ribbentrop without telling them. Was shocked again when Germans 
launched Barbarossa without giving them heads up. </p><p class="rm-manual">10.
 So by this point Japan had only 2 options, either give all their 
conquests south of Manchuria*, or Nanshin-ron, i.e. strike first at US, 
UK and Dutch colonies </p><p class="rm-manual">*I don’t know this for 
sure, but I think FDR was deliberately ambiguous about whether Japan can
 keep Manchuria. This was non-negotiable as Manchukuo was a state within
 a state for the Kanto Army. Okamura Yasuji would later advise the KMT 
in the Liaoshen Campaign, and remarked </p><p class="rm-manual">宁可丢本土，不可丢满洲 „We can afford to lose the Home Islands before we can lose Manchuria." Replies: @Chinaman</p><p class="rm-manual"></p></span><p class="rm-manual">Let me ask you this. </p> <p class="rm-manual">We

 It’s a cargo cult. The reasoning being that America was more democratic
 and diverse and had more equal rights than Wilhelmine Germany, and way 
more democratic and diverse and had way more equal rights than Nazi 
Germany, and was more democratic and diverse and had more equality than 
the “anti-Semitic” USSR, and it won against each of them, therefore 
being on the “right side of history” is always going to be beneficial, 
thus we need to increase “diversity, equity and inclusion” ad infinitum

<p class="rm-manual">The wokening of the US military is one massive 
ongoing experiment. It is Tikkun Olam in action. Just like the Plandemic
 and all the mRNA vaccines.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The Armed Forces 
from their very inception were highly Masonic, just think for 33 degree 
George Washington, or Lafayette. Of course the entire “revolution” was 
really just a masonic rebellion and take over, but that is not the point
 here. The Airforce, and later NASA, are little more than giant 
freemason lodges. The latest evidence comes from the “murder” of senior 
airman and devout throupler Ashli Babbit.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Freemasonry
 is just Kabbala and Baphomet worship for goyim. Baphomet is of course 
the ultimate “woke” god, representing all 
androgyne/bisexual/bestiality/pedophilic perversions in one. But not 
only does having a “woke” gay-disco army help promote Baphomet and 
Kabbalism directly, it also provides the loyal cadre necessary to 
enforce the woke world order, or as they are sugar coating it now as, 
“the great reset”.</p> <p class="rm-manual">This queer military is far 
more about enforcing perversion and the transformation of the US into 
Sodom and Gomorrah than it is about “defending” the “US”. The globalist 
take over is complete anyway, the tech industry has created an 
electronic control matrix all across the planet. China, wittingly or 
unwittingly, has ensnared its self in this kabbala spider web.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 modern military really isn’t about noble foot soldiers duking it out 
with fire arms anyway. Drones, underwater drones, drone tanks, stealth 
drones, and swarms of drones, don’t require valiant and honest soldiers.
 Loyal and trigger happy porn addicted sadistic gay disco voyeurs spying

 the public approval rating for the military remains very high at 72%, 
higher than Congress, the media, or the President. Basically the 
military just follows the trends of society, so as society gets more 
liberal and woke, the military will get more liberal and woke, unless it
 wants to increase the social distance between it and the people that it
 serves, which brings forth another whole set of problems. Also if the 
social distance between the military and the people it serves becomes to
 great, that will also bring into peril civilian control over the 
military, if the people in the military feels increasingly distant and 
alienated from the people they are serving due to increasing gulf of 
social values.

 good point. It means that wokism won’t just have a corrosive effect on 
society and the economy, but it will simultaneously erode the military 
power. And not just indirectly, by increasing the cost of maintaining it
 (diversity requirements for the suppliers etc.), but also directly. But
 it also makes it more difficult to keep wokism in civilian life in the 
event of a military reform. So either wokism gets partly or fully rolled
 back or the military won’t get stronger even after serious defeats. </p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

<p class="rm-manual">There is no whitepill here that, “Oh, these people 
are just politicians playing the game. They know the American military 
has spent decades degrading its human capital and that these Woke games 
are even worse, that driving straight White men out of the military and 
making it unappealing to new straight White men to enlist is a death 
sentence.” I certainly think that, and many people here think so, too, 
but the top brass says replacing White men with “diversity” provides a 
military advantage comparable to superior to China’s espionage and 
R&amp;D closing technology gaps and I think they believe that. </p> <p class="rm-manual">Alongside
 the Diversity and Inclusion drumbeat is a now sort of Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission starting with that “60 day stand down” to talk
 about how best to throw out right wing people from the U.S. military by
 calling those people White supremacists, domestic terrorists, political
 extremists and insurrectionist. That was the first thing the new black 
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin did. All of that stuff is only going 
to increase. That’s the double whammy to hammer the human capital. Its 
not just that the freaks and geeks are going to be brought in and 
promoted, its that they are being brought in to replace the future 
purged military members and making enlisting in the military and 
re-enlisting in the military a total turn off.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I
 really do believe that the leadership does think that this diversity 
and inclusion stuff has made the military better, not worse, and that 
driving out “insurrectionists” will make it better and not worse, and 
making it less appealing to straight White men to remain in it and join 
it will be good, not bad.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Also, if NATO forces 
ever truly took a nice, thorough shellacking at the hands of a proper 
competitor or roughly equivalent military alliance, we all know what the
 apologetics for that would be. They didn’t lose because diversity and 
inclusion had turned the military into a Woke college campus farce. They
 didn’t lose because they were too diverse an inclusive, they lost 
because they weren’t diverse and inclusive ENOUGH. True diversity and

 agree that this will be the argument of the wokist true believers. But 
how many hangers-on and opportunists will just think that this is now

 smart and educated guys who keep winning say. They will now be the 
people who lost a serious war against a serious adversary. If not in

 Tor Hörbiger was the theorist of Hollow-Earth, protected by Hitler. 
German academics were humiliated when they were constrained to watch an 
experiment in a deep coal mine in Silesia in which two spheres moved 
away from each other by a very short distance, and this was alleged to 
be due to the centrifugal force, as we would be living in a concave 
surface within a solid Earth, where the Sun would be at its center, and 
the ligth would be distorted to appear as if we were living on a convex 
surface. Indeed, the real reason of the movement done by the spheres was
 the gravitational force exerted by the landmass around them inside the 
mine. Adding this delusion to other myths such as Shamballah (from 
Palladic branches of freemasons, like Theosophism), Agartha (from 
Martinist branches of freemasons, like Traditionalists), etc. we 
conclude that gnosis leads to the destruction of rational science and

 I believe they were close to the present day Macedonian border (much 
closer to Constantinople than to Vienna) and there was talk of 
liberating Constantinople. Also there was a landing operation in present
 day Greece. Doesn’t much change the picture of there being a series of 
Ottoman victories before the final defeat, and the last ten years of the
 war could be seen as a kind of dynamic stalemate after the initial 
losses. So the average Ottoman subject could believe that maybe the next
 war would bring more success. They did win the next war against Russia 
but then lost against Austria, then lost against Russia but won against 
Austria, and it took a long time before the Ottomans fully understood

certainly think that, and many people here think so, too, but the top

Ottoman victories before the final defeat, and the last ten years of the
 war could be seen as a kind of dynamic stalemate after the initial 
losses. So the average Ottoman subject could believe that maybe the next
 war would bring more success. They did win the next war against Russia

Austria, and it took a long time before the Ottomans fully understood

 were humiliated when they were constrained to watch an experiment in a

centrifugal force, as we would be living in a concave surface within a

 the real reason of the movement done by the spheres was the

 Karlin I was in the Army from 1975-86. The post-Vietnam, volunteer 
military was at a low ebb throughout the 70s, with bad morale 
(especially demoralized officers &amp; NCOs), poor discipline, worse 
readiness, continuing racial problems, &amp; declining percentages of 
enlistees who were high school graduates. Then came Reagan, an immediate
 15% pay raise for all ranks, &amp; soon after, the "Reagan recession" 
of 1981-83, which drove many unemployed but competent people into the 
military so they could have a relatively decent job. This caused a 
dramatic rise in the overall quality of enlistees. In the Army we had 
people with masters degrees in statistics enlisting in combat arms. All 
metrics of combat readiness rose...suddenly I had young white guys in my
 field artillery battery - not just mechanics, but 13B privates 
(cannoneers) - who could actually repair broke-dick vehicles - it was 
great! </p><p class="rm-manual">But that was long ago, before the

 "Infamy" by John Toland explains the Pearl Harbor shtick. US 
codebreakers had broken the vaunted Japanese Purple Code several weeks 
before 12-7-41. Roosevelt, Admiral King and General Marshall all knew 
well beforehand the general outline of the Japanese attack strategy. 
They resolutely refused to allow General Short and Admiral Kimmel in on 
the dope. What was the reason? </p><p class="rm-manual">Led by the likes
 of Charles Lindbergh Jr., the America First movement was large and 
influential. As a body the American people did not want to get involved 
in another war, whether against the Germans in Europe or Asia versus the
 Japanese. This state of affairs presented a major stumbling block to 
the financier Cabal's plans to crush Germany, take Japan down a few 
notches and make the U$ the new hegemon in world affairs. That, of 
course, hinged on continued behind the scenes control over the U$ 
government by the financial elite's "Federal" Reserve Bank. </p><p class="rm-manual">Presenting
 a face of running the show, FDR desperately did all he could to aid 
Britain and eventually Soviet Russia through Lend-Lease and various 
other stratagems. The most egregious of those was to use American naval 
forces to escort convoys of merchant ships bringing war materiel to 
Britain. On the Asiatic front, the Grand Strategy involved the U$, 
Britain and the Dutch government in exile to cut off all oil and iron 
exports to the Japanese, who were, at that time, deeply involved in 
their invasion of China. How the hell you gonna make a major war of 
aggression in 20th Century terms without oil and steel? Impossible. </p><p class="rm-manual">
 The Asian strategy worked. The Germans failed to fall for the 
sucker-bait and strike back as the U$ naval forces depth-charging their 
U-Boats. By June of '41 Germany was drawn into a two-front war as they 
had invaded the Soviet Union. No way did they want to face America's 
industrial might and its military besides. So Roosevelt and Churchill 
employed the back-door route via the Japanese as those two nations had 
signed a mutual defense pact. Deprived of the materials to keep up their
 war on China, Japan desperately developed their plan of attack on Pearl
 Harbor. </p><p class="rm-manual"> With high casualties at Pearl Harbor 
that Sunday morning and with Battleship Row devastated, the American 
people were easily goaded into war-fever. Admiral Kimmel and General 
Short caught it in the shorts. Scapegoats were needed. They drew the 
short straw. Roosevelt, Churchill and the Rottenfeller and Rottenchild 
Crime Clans cutting the orders for those two smarmy prostiticians, got 
their war. </p><p class="rm-manual"> The truth about Pearl Harbor was all about politics up front and stealthy highest finance calling the shots. Replies: @Alfa158</p><p class="rm-manual"></p></span><p class="rm-manual">I
 would agree with almost all of that, but it is not really established 
that the US knew there would be a surprise attack specifically on Pearl 
Harbor. The Purple Code that was broken was a diplomatic code and 
contained no details on the movements or plans of military assets. The 
traffic basically said that Japan was going to make one last effort to 
break the blockade and sanctions diplomatically and if that failed it 
would mean war.</p><p class="rm-manual"> The Japanese fleet had 
disappeared from view several weeks prior and was training in the 
extreme northern islands of Japan. When they sailed for Pearl Harbor 
they took a route that evaded commercial shipping, observed strict radio
 silence and kept garbage on board the ships so any patrols would spot 
it floating in their wake.</p><p class="rm-manual"> The US military and 
government was aware that something was up, but thought if there was a 
surprise attack it would be conducted closer to Japan against someplace 
like the Philippines.</p><p class="rm-manual"> For the purposes of the 
Crime Clans getting the US into WW2, it really was largely irrelevant 
how devastating a surprise attack would be or which base was struck, the
 specific details weren’t that important. They just needed an attack to 
draw the US in. It was a bonus for them that Germany foolishly honored 
their mutual defense treaty with Japan and declared war on the US.</p><p class="rm-manual">
 The US Navy sent the carriers and their escorts out to sea on a 
combination training mission and sweep to see if the Japanese fleet was 
anywhere in the area, but the Japanese made sure to approach Pearl 
Harbor from the least expected direction.</p><p class="rm-manual"> When 
the code breakers reported that the Japanese embassy had orders to burn 
their papers they actually tried to send messages to their bases 
including Pearl Harbor. Because of atmospheric radio conditions, the 
transmission by radio didn’t work and Washington used the Western Union 
cable to send coded telegrams that weren’t decoded and delivered to 
Kimmel until after the attacks.</p><p class="rm-manual"> The US lucked 
out by having out to sea the ships that it turned out would be most 
important for fighting WW2 ; the carriers and their escorting cruisers 
and destroyers. As shocking as the spectacle of the devastation and loss
 of life was, all the Japanese accomplished was to blow up the US Navy’s
 meticulously preserved collection of charming but obsolete WW1 
battleships. The oil supplies and repair facilities mostly survived 
because the Japanese became concerned that the missing carriers might be
 stalking them and Ozawa called off follow ups attacks. It was like Ford
 trying to cripple Chevrolet’s ability to sell cars by blowing up the 
classic Corvette museum in Bowling Green.</p><p class="rm-manual"> The 
lightening advances of the Japanese during the first six months of the 
war were not due to the loss of the battleships, but because the 
Japanese Army Navy and Air Forces had superiority in numbers, training, 
morale, technology and weapons systems. The US knew it was unprepared 
and that a war was planned so when the war broke out the design and 
building of the new ships, aircraft and weapons that would win the war 
was already underway. That was why the Essex carriers, fast battleships,
 Avengers, Hellcats, P-38’s, P-47’s, B-24’s and so forth entered service
 within only a couple of years of Pearl Harbor. </p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

that China as a political entity would remain (even killing all

 The size of the army will be drastically reduced, with personnel to be 
cut by 10,000 by 2024 and a further 2,500 by 2030, to a target size of 
70,000. Ministers aim to do this by cuts in recruitment rather than 
making soldiers redundant.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">Army
 chiefs envisage a smaller, better-trained army, with better kit, 
operating as a high-skill, high-readiness unit similar to the US 
Marines. But that will involve the loss of legacy capabilities and 
reduce the war-fighting division from four to two armoured brigades and 
the shrinking or disbanding of 23 battalion-sized units. Cancelling an 
upgrade to 600 Warrior troop carriers will save £1.5 billion.</p> <p class="rm-manual">General
 Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, the chief of the general staff, has twice had 
to resubmit plans for the redesign because they did not feature enough 
robots, attack drones and AI. AS-90 155mm self-propelled howitzers and 
multi-launch rocket systems will be replaced late in the decade with 
attack drones and precision-guided rockets, while 89 howitzers dating 
from the 1970s will be withdrawn.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Drones for jets</p><p class="rm-manual">
 An order for 90 more F-35 Lightning combat jets is to be cancelled in 
favour of the Tempest fighter, built in Lancashire, while 24 older 
Typhoon fighters will be retired early. Whole fleets of aircraft will be
 taken out of service as drones become ever more common.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 RAF will lose 11 manned spy planes, a 45 per cent cut, with the 
Sentinel and Islander aircraft not being replaced after their retirement
 this year. There will also be a gap in coverage from E-3D Sentry 
airborne early-warning radar planes for two to three years, while 
replacement Wedgetails will be cut from five to three. Also to be 
scrapped are 14 C-130J Hercules transport planes used by the SAS.</p> <p class="rm-manual">BAE-146
 passenger jets from 32 (Royal) Squadron, used by the Queen, Prince 
Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, will be replaced by 
leased aircraft. The transport helicopter fleet will be cut by 45 
helicopters or 41%.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Scuttling of the subs</p><p class="rm-manual">

the stamina to work hard 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. I thought I was

lifestyle, no need for Muscle Confusion and gyms and what not. It's like
 here in the U.S., why these skinny gym-fit American women have trouble 
pushing out a baby, but the overweight, non-Zumba class Mexican illegal

 think neither the Romans or the Americans ever started with imperial

 Thanks for the introduction to Iwane Matsui. Quite embarrassed that I 
have not heard of him. It is quite shocking that the man who was held 
responsible for the Nanking Massacre was also a Sinophile and an 
advocate of pan-Asiaism ( as I am)! How Japan ended up, not pacifying 
but massacring his brother must be of extreme anguish to him. He even 
said that it was happy that he was made an example. He probably saw 
Chiang as a Hanjian\sellout and think that white people have gotten to 
him. That’s kind of how I see Japanese leadership now! The usual Divide 
and conquer and playing both sides from the White devil. It is sad that,
 despite all the good intentions, war and greed have a logic of its own.
 I think the fundamental problem was that Japan wanted to be the 
leader\centre of this pan-Asia Union, which historically and 
economically, could not have been the case. It makes me think we need a 
very high level of economic and cultural integration in order for the 
pan-Asia Union to succeed. Not only economic power but cultural soft 
power like Manga or South Korean boy band kind of thing. That’s the only
 way pan Asia-ism can succeed. China is lacking in this area and there 
really needs to be a cultural revival that would suck Koreans and 
Japanese into our orbit. I guess this won’t happen when two Chinaman is

 now Tokyo ups the ante to *explicit* recognition of Manchukuo and then

aggressive demands. Which are then again refused. </p><p class="rm-manual">This
 cycle of behavior repeats several times. They have to invade Wuhan in

 up launching Greater East Asia War just so they don’t lose everything.

 terms of fighting the first battle on the first day of a war, the 1970s
 military was in worse shape in almost every way. The junior enlisted 
ranks were full of resentful, occasionally mutinous, low-IQ types 
(mostly blacks). Competent NCOs were leaving in droves. The motor pool 
was a shambles, weapons systems were often inoperable, &amp; readiness 
reports were lies. Budgets were too low for hard, realistic training 
(except in a few elite units, like Rangers &amp; perhaps the 82nd 
Airborne Division). </p><p class="rm-manual">But we had no illusions. 
Everyone knew what the main problem was: we had shitty soldiers. We knew
 that if we survived the first day of the next war, even defeated, if we
 weren't totally destroyed we would get rid of the scum (by whatever 
means necessary), &amp; the good NCOs would be allowed to really take 
charge, impose discipline, &amp; get the job done. We didn't have any PC
 regs that would have prevented that. </p><p class="rm-manual">Now, the 
entire military - except, maybe, a few special operations units - lives 
24/7 under illusions: that women in combat units (&amp; others requiring
 physical strength) are equal to men, that insane ideas like "diversity 
makes us stronger" are valid principles of war, that white hillbillies 
&amp; white urban ethnics are more likely to be seditious racist 
terrorists than what they have always been in all our wars: the backbone
 of our combat forces. </p><p class="rm-manual">And I have no confidence
 that even disastrous defeat would cause our leaders to change the "woke

military and the kinds of people (especially rural &amp; Southern

direction. </p><p class="rm-manual">Also, the generals never directly 
challenged the great lie of feminism, that women can be effective combat
 soldiers if only given the proper training and a fair chance, &amp; 
that only sexism has prevented gender-balanced armies throughout 
history. As a result, whenever Democrats like Clinton were in power, 
feminism advanced in the military. Whenever Republicans were in power, 
they were too cowardly to forthrightly condemn feminism as a form of

<p class="rm-manual">Are you talking about the rear echelon reserves or

the domestic troops and the reserves, the front-line troops in West 
Germany were largely in acceptable shape even in the mid to late 70s, 
the problem was the lack of reserves. And even before the M-1’s arrival 
the M-60 was roughly kept up to date with the T-72 with the M60A3 
version, and the M60A3 TTS actually had a more advanced FCS than the M1 
or M1A1. Somehow the Reagan administration found it a good idea not the 
fit the M1 with the 120mm gun until 1986, when the Germans were fitting 
the 120mm gun into their Leopards from the start in the early 80s. The 
Apache also was not introduced until 1986, although the AH-1 with TOWs 
and the German PAH-1 with HOT missiles, and the French Gazelle with 
HOTSs were a good tank hunters also. The M60A3, or even the M48A5 were 
actually not that bad for 70s tanks, the Chieftain also turned out to be
 a pretty good tank once the Stillbrew armour package was installed and 
the engine problems were fixed in the early 80s. </p> </li>

 authors say the book was born out of their frustration to the 
indifference shown by the Washington establishment to the cybersecurity 
threats that they had previously examined in conventional policy papers.
 So they re-wrote it as a novel (a novel with copious footnotes).</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 first half is a dive into technical weaknesses of U.S. equipment and

 falls, the U.S. meets defeat in the Pacific.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 second part of the book is, as you say, about the deus-ex-machina plot

<blockquote class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual">Military defeat is one of the very few things that could decisively discredit the Woke ideology.</p> </blockquote> <p class="rm-manual">Doesn’t
 the US lose every war now? Even when it has a clear win, it keeps 
fighting until it turns into a loss, or at best a pyrrhic victory.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Most
 of the time for a country to learn from a defeat, it has to be a brutal
 and costly defeat. And even then, the lesson may or may not sink in. 
Lessons about ground-level human factors like training, morale, and 
underlying talent of your men are probably the toughest lessons to sink 
in; lessons about weapon systems are some of the easiest.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Most
 of the time that human factors are clearly the culprit, the reason is 
that you’re collapsing, and a tiny but highly motivated, high-asabiyyah 
force is rolling up your theoretically much larger force and causing the
 men to defect or desert. Chinese dynasties tended to collapse in ways 
like this, but you also saw this dynamic in events like the Hamas 
capture of Gaza from Fatah. But in a Great Power war, there’s too much 
going on for many lessons to be drawn from differences in human capital,
 which in that context are probably going to translate to something on 
the order of 50% more efficiency, not 1000%+ as it might be in something
 like Hamas vs. Fatah.</p> <p class="rm-manual">So if we suppose that 
the US lost a major naval war against China, with one or more USN 
aircraft carriers sunk, I think the Pentagon, in its self-assessment, 
would say that it didn’t have the right tools for the job, not that it 
used its tools poorly. And the politicians would go along with that. “We
 need ships and aircraft that directly counter what China is doing! 
We’ve been too focused on counter-insurgency for too long!”</p> <p class="rm-manual">And
 the fact is that if China successfully took Taiwan, there would be no 
real need for another Sino-American War. So the US could go on retooling
 for the next war for a generation, without the war ever coming. I 
wouldn’t expect any kind of sincere correction in the face of that. </p> </li>

 Thanks for the introduction to Iwane Matsui. Quite embarrassed that I 
have not heard of him. It is quite shocking that the man who was held 
responsible for the Nanking Massacre was also a Sinophile and an 
advocate of pan-Asiaism ( as I am)! How Japan ended up, not pacifying 
but massacring his brother must be of extreme anguish to him. He even 
said that it was happy that he was made an example. He probably saw 
Chiang as a Hanjian\sellout and think that white people have gotten to 
him. That’s kind of how I see Japanese leadership now! The usual Divide 
and conquer and playing both sides from the White devil. It is sad that,
 despite all the good intentions, war and greed have a logic of its own.
 I think the fundamental problem was that Japan wanted to be the 
leader\centre of this pan-Asia Union, which historically and 
economically, could not have been the case. It makes me think we need a 
very high level of economic and cultural integration in order for the 
pan-Asia Union to succeed. Not only economic power but cultural soft 
power like Manga or South Korean boy band kind of thing. That’s the only
 way pan Asia-ism can succeed. China is lacking in this area and there

 Well I’d put it differently. Germans were perceived as reliable by both
 sides and and clearly has the most to gain from Japan and China being 
frens. But in the end that couldn’t be helped </p><p class="rm-manual">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trautmann_mediation </p><p class="rm-manual">The
 original Japanese demand was only *de facto* recognition of Manchukuo. 
Even the most hawkish KMT brass, Guangxi-clique’s Bai Chongxi remarked 
„If these are the only conditions, then why do we need to go to war?“ </p><p class="rm-manual">Then
 on Oct 1937, IJA sends a third round of re-enforcement to Shanghai, 
Heisuke Yanagawa’s 10th Army lands in Hangzhou Bay south of Shanghai 
unopposed, outflanks the Chinese, who retreats in disarray. Ignoring 
orders from Tokyo, the 10th Army then begins a race with Shanghai 
Expedition Army (SEA) to Nanjing, which in short time build to a 
Kesselschlacht. </p><p class="rm-manual">The doves mainly, Hayao Tada, cited this precedent and got overruled </p><p class="rm-manual">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Tada#Second_Sino-Japanese_War</p><blockquote class="rm-manual">
 In order to prevent "unnecessary bitterness of feeling or desire for 
revenge" and forestall intervention by France or Russia, Bismarck pushed
 King William I of Prussia to make peace with the Austrians rapidly, 
rather than continue the war in hopes of further gains </blockquote>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Prussian_War <p class="rm-manual"></p><p class="rm-manual">So
 now Tokyo ups the ante to *explicit* recognition of Manchukuo and then 
some. This was of course unacceptable to Chiang. So after Nanjing, IJA 
scores more victories, Chiang refuses to surrender but did *not* leave 
the door closed for negotiation. Japan comes back with even more 
aggressive demands. Which are then again refused. </p><p class="rm-manual">This
 cycle of behavior repeats several times. They have to invade Wuhan in 
order to justify for the cost of existing conquests. And have to invade 
Vietnam because Chiang still doesn’t surrender after losing 80% of his 
GDP. When their biggest materiel supplier, US, cuts them off, they ended
 up launching Greater East Asia War just so they don’t lose everything.

 The background here is obscure. Until the fall of Qing, Manchuria was 
sealed off from Han Chinese migration 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuang_Guandong. The Manchus have not 
fully assimilated by then, so it was not automatically assumed that Hans
 have legitimacy of rule there. Entering the power vacuum was a gambit 
between the Russians and the Japanese Pan-Asianists 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dragon_Society, which culminated in 
the Russo-Japanese War. </p><p class="rm-manual">By the time of Mukden 
Incident, the Soviets already have a puppet state in Outer Mongolia 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic#Consolidation_of_power_(1925%E2%80%9338),
 </p><p class="rm-manual">So the Japanese thought it was thought it was 
hypocritical that the West would criticize them for doing the same in 
Manchuria but not SU for what they are doing in Mongolia. </p><p class="rm-manual">The
 architect of Mukden Incident was a Pan-Asianist 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_Ishiwara and adherent to Nichiren 
Buddhism. Ishiwara contended for Manchukuo to be a multi-ethnic nation 
and for Japan, Manchukuo and China to be allies against the SU and West.
 </p><p class="rm-manual">He like other Pan-Asianist would later become 
disillusioned about the expansion of the war to China Proper, seeing it 
as a corruption of their ideals.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 All is true. I think the last time the PLA had any real combat, prior

1979. They did not do well, loosing 50,000 troops in a 6 week period. If
 you were a raw 18 yo conscript in 1979, you would be going on 60 today.

 Why has China failed to get any agreement for the South China Sea 
dispute? Is it because lack of interest? If not does that mean that 
China's maximalist claim is simply untenable, something that it's 
neighbours will never accept unlees forced to do. Even if China wins a 
war, it will suffer damage. Though is it likely that China will win a 
conflict in SEA, if it alienate Vietnam and the Phillipines? My take is 
that China is still the underdog. Countries like Vietnam should be ideal
 allies for China, but is instead a rival. </p><p class="rm-manual">Is

way round...money printing inflates away the debt. Where do you think 
all the stimulus money come from? I think 20% of it went to help people 
pay off debt. You need to read Ray Dalio. <p class="rm-manual">Human 
civilisation was doomed once we started letting women go to university 
and letting them gain financial independence. These 2 factors delay 
childbearing and dramatically reduce a women’s fertility. It is also 
dysgenic because their eggs accumulate more mutations as they get older.
 Contraception don’t help of course. Asian women have never ever gained 
financial independence in 5000 years of history and this is the most 
disastrous thing ever since they became really picky. This is especially
 bad for the ugly girls with high educational attainment. Korea and 
Taiwan Fertility is close to one now and it will never recover. There is
 a reason why every societies and religion have oppressed women from the
 earliest of times. It is not because it is misogyny but that societies 
just fall apart in a few generations. Wasn’t that what happened to Rome 
when most of the upper class became impotent from lead? White people 
really fuck it up for humankind by liberating women. Replies: @Steven80</p><p class="rm-manual"></p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>

 The eleven dash line/nine-dash-line is colonialism born out of Chiang 
Kai Shek's ass. It will never be recognized in SEA, and as SEA's 
military becomes better (especially with missile tech from Russia), it 
will be China who will be humbled, and that means both the revisionists 
Dengoids in mainland and the gay taiwanese in the island. China failed 
to colonize SEA even when we were tribesmen, they could do jackshit now 
with when we have developed our own national language. Replies:

 are cultural factors as well, but if a man has enough money to sustain a

 the problem with fertility is mostly related to use of sound money and 
stopping governments from printing. It is not easy, but is solvable - by

 Inflating the debt is exactly the bad thing - it is only good if you 
have debts. Productive people are those who manage to save and they get 
punished by this inflation. </p><p class="rm-manual">If you don't 
inflate currency, productive people manage to save and invest usually in
 something productive - this is the core of economic growth. If you do 
the opposite, you encourage non-productive people, and it always ends in
 disaster. This is like giving money to gamblers or addicts. Here's an 
oversimlistic example of what hapened with the Roman empire with their

 the women - I totally agree it was a mistake. I don't know how this can
 be solved - perhaps a mix of media propaganda and financial aid only

all the blacks there are making babies and living on social security, 
deepening the state problems. Singapore did somehow better - they gave 
money to women that had kids and were students, but it didn't really 
boost fertility among the smartest. And yes, mutations are very bad -

those progressives were swiftly killed when the Mongols came and no one

 All is true. I think the last time the PLA had any real combat, prior 
to this current thing with India, was the border war with Vietnam in 
1979. They did not do well, loosing 50,000 troops in a 6 week period. If
 you were a raw 18 yo conscript in 1979, you would be going on 60 today.

 A gigantic aircraft carrier is no threat to China especially close to 
their coast. Carriers are done. Any built after the nimitz class are a 
total waste, meaning the Ford class, along with the F35. Plus, as 
Anatoly said, we don't posses the MANpower to man carriers and 
squadrons. In 76, between hangar deck and the roof, Nimitz routinely 
sailed with 8 squadrons 100 aircraft, big planes, F14s and A6 Intruders.
 My first cruise we also carried 3 or 4 Vigilante recon planes. And 6000
 total crew. The planes were big bastards. Because we can't MAN them 
anymore they only carry 65 or 70. With worse range and fewer refuelling 
assets than in the 70s through 80s, NAVAIR is vastly outgunned with 
current-state F18s at sea. Throw in China/Russia/Iran defensive missiles
 and you can see why carriers are toast. But Anatoly is most correct 
about MANpower. When you add in the hideous personnel issues, homos and

<p class="rm-manual">Billionaire Tyrants Are Using the Woke/Cancel Culture to Consolidate Their Control of Society and the US Military</p> <p class="rm-manual">On
 reflection, I think we might be misunderstanding the situation. 
Billionaires continue becoming wealthier regardless if the US is winning
 or loosing a war. In fact, they might prefer a loosing war because then
 money is thrown around without much oversight.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Many
 of the German industrialists, who were wealthy in 1900, were still 
wealthy in 1960, after loosing 2 world wars. Since there were close ties
 between the US and German industrialists, likely the 
military-industrial complex in the US has been learning from those 
Germans, who kept their wealth, while disastrously loosing those wars.</p> <p class="rm-manual">In
 addition, what does a billionaire globalist care as to which nation 
state is winning or loosing a war? They will be gaining wealth thru 
supplying both sides of every war. As long as there are wars, somewhere 
on the planet, there will be profiteering opportunities for increasing 
their wealth. The whole imperialism angle is largely a good excuse to 
start more wars.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Below I describe the impact of
 the woke/cancel culture on all of this, and then describe what can be 
done about it. As I kept reflecting, this essay kept growing to about 
1900 words.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span>[MORE]</span></p><p class="rm-manual"> – – – – – – – –</p><p class="rm-manual">
 While the billionaires mostly don’t care who wins wars, likely care a 
lot about anything that would weaken the woke/cancel culture. Making an 
exception, saying the woke culture is really important, “but don’t do it
 in the military”, would significantly weaken that culture. </p><p class="rm-manual">The
 woke/cancel culture is the functional equivalent of death squads and 
summary executions, but without any blowback. The woke/cancel culture 
makes it easy to create a fake case of political incorrectness, 
publicize it, and then turn loose the woke piranhas to destroy the power
 and influence of that person. The billionaires aren’t likely to risk 
the usefulness of a tool that is so effective in eliminating leaders of 
opposition against them.</p> <p class="rm-manual">In short, the 
billionaires don’t loose any wealth because the US military is weakened,
 and they gain more power by promoting the woke/cancel culture, which 
they steer thru their propaganda.</p> <p class="rm-manual">– – – – – – – –</p><p class="rm-manual">
 An exception, to billionaire globalists not caring about the outcome of
 wars, is their desire to cancel and destroy whole countries who refuse 
to cooperate with globalism. However their track record in accomplishing
 this is pretty poor. Yes, the globalists have attacked and weakened 
many countries who resist them, but there is a very short list of 
countries they completely destroyed.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">This
 reinforces my belief, that using the military-industrial complex as a 
cash cow, to milk decade in and decade out, is more important to 
billionaires than the actual competency and effectiveness of the US 
military.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Besides that, why would the 
globalists want to completely win most of the wars against countries 
opposing globalism? Most people have short memories, and dangling the 
forever wars (which greatly increase the wealth of globalists and 
decrease the power of the anti-globalists) in front of people, who are 
dragging their feet on globalism, is useful in coercing cooperation from
 the foot draggers.</p> <p class="rm-manual">In short, a weakened US 
military is highly effective as a cash cow, and is highly effective in 
coercing most of the global south to cooperate with globalism.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Further
 weakening the US military isn’t likely to significantly undermine those
 roles. On the other hand, currently the US military is a hotbed of 
opposition to most of the agendas in the great reset. At least once a 
year, somewhere in the world, a country’s military is instrumental in 
resolving an internal political crisis.</p> <p class="rm-manual">So 
replacing the traditional culture people in the US military (who greatly
 resist the great reset), and replacing them with woke zombies, who 
never question the propaganda, is likely high on the list of globalist 
priorities.</p> <p class="rm-manual">All in all, the woke/cancel culture is manna from heaven for the billionaire globalists.</p> <p class="rm-manual">– – – – – – – –</p><p class="rm-manual">
 The servants of the billionaire globalists are extremely effective in 
psyops. In hindsight, I can now see roots of the woke culture developing
 in the 1960’s, so I have doubts that it is manna from heaven, and 
suspect the woke culture resulted from a very long-term psyop, in 
combination with a majority of people defaulting on their responsibility
 to do cultural stewardship.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">Part
 of that psyop was propaganda promoting the idea that supporting 
divide-and-conquer wedges is cultural stewardship, not cultural suicide.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 billionaire globalists successfully convinced the majority of liberals 
and progressives in the value of “humanitarian” bombing of civilians.</p> <p class="rm-manual">If
 they can do that, then they can also succeed with promoting 
“peacekeeping thru violence”, and demonizing those who resist “peace”.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Look
 at antifa celebrating the death of Trump supporters. Compare that to 
anti-war protesters in the 1960’s handing out flowers to the national 
guard. The conversion of that peaceful anti-war culture into the violent
 antifa culture would make a very useful case study in how the 
globalists control society in the US.</p> <p class="rm-manual">40 years 
ago the USMC was promoting the slogan “lean, mean, green, killing 
machine”. While that was useful in honing the edge of a valuable tool 
for repressing anti-globalist countries, the people attracted to 
volunteering to do that were solidly in the traditionalist, 
conservative, “mom and apple pie culture”, which is headed in the 
opposite direction from the great reset. Probably the globalists have 
been having nightmares about that killing machine turning on them.</p> <p class="rm-manual">So
 it seems likely the billionaire globalists will succeed in replacing 
the traditional culture in the US military with a woke culture. 
Easy-peasy if you are a psyop expert, and don’t care about the 
effectiveness of the US military.</p> <p class="rm-manual">– – – – – – – –</p><p class="rm-manual">
 Perhaps the most useful aspect of the woke/cancel culture, for the 
billionaires, is its use in crushing the general social capital of US 
society.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital</a></p><p class="rm-manual">
 “It involves the effective functioning of social groups through 
interpersonal relationships, a shared sense of identity, a shared 
understanding, shared norms, shared values, trust, cooperation, and 
reciprocity.”</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">The 
billionaires are tyrants, and don’t want any of that unity stuff or 
ability to independently organize community groups – they just want 
people to shut up and do what they are told.</p><p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant</a></p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 bulk of the skills, which make up the social capital in the US, is with
 the euroamerican ethnic group. Its very traditional for tyrants, who 
recently gained power, to kill all officers, teachers, and priests – the
 educated and trained people who would be capable of organizing 
effective opposition to the tyrant.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Once again,
 the billionaire tyrants can’t afford the blowback from physically 
killing the large numbers of people who oppose them. So they are 
demonizing the euroamericans (anybody with white skin, regardless of 
their ethnicity), which often destroys their social standing and income.
 This is better than killing them because now there are many victims 
floundering around, and draining resources from their social networks. 
Depressed people, with crushed self-confidence, who are living in 
poverty, aren’t much of a threat to the billionaire tyrants.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 billionaire tyrants are replacing the euroamerican people in the US 
with AI and foreign workers that they import, who aren’t in any position
 to object to anything. The billionaires don’t need the euroamericans in
 the US, and really want to avoid effective opposition to their tyranny.
 So the simple solution is to destroy the effectiveness of the 
euroamericans in the US, and particularly target those who become public
 figures, and then object to the woke culture.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Keep
 in mind the two most important goals of the propaganda from the 
billionaires is to get people to shoot themselves in the foot, and then 
limp around fighting the self-defeating battles triggered by 
divide-and-conquer wedges.</p> <p class="rm-manual">– – – – – – – –</p><p class="rm-manual">
 We need to focus on 3 parallel efforts. The first is countering the 
propaganda from the billionaires. The second is organizing and 
mobilizing opposition to the billionaires.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 third is focusing on cultural stewardship to rebuild the strength of 
the society in the US. I don’t mean focusing on divide-and-conquer 
wedges like sexuality or abortion.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I mean 
encouraging opposition to hypocrisy, disrespect, narrowed perspectives, 
and self-serving agendas. The flip side of that is encouraging people to
 walk their talk, being respectful to all people, looking broad and deep
 for the best perspective, looking for the effects of actions, carefully
 balancing the needs of individuals and the community, and building 
cooperation in serving the community.</p> <p class="rm-manual">There are
 many examples of people who have been working to do this, who are 
building bridges, and are healing the damage caused by 
divide-and-conquer wedges. They do this by finding common ground and 
then using that common ground as a foundation for encouraging 
cooperation and greater understanding between different groups of 
people..</p> <p class="rm-manual">Part of finding the best perspective 
is thinking about the info you find, and comparing and contrasting that 
info to find the most useful perspective. Assessing the effects of 
actions also takes thinking. Balancing the needs of individuals and the 
community takes more thinking. All of this thinking will undermine the 
woke culture because doing all that thinking derails the knee-jerk 
acceptance of propaganda.</p> <p class="rm-manual">– – – – – – – –</p><p class="rm-manual">
 This battle for the soul of humanity is going to be won thru teaching 
people better ways to live their lives, not violence. And it must be 
done thru a distributed network of people, like with the yellow vests in
 France, without any centralized control point that the billionaire 
globalists can co-opt or destroy.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">We
 need time to educate those who have been suckered by the propaganda. We
 need some freedom of movement and communication, and some civil rights 
to accomplish this.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Violence will be used as 
justification to take away our remaining rights, which will make it 
extremely difficult and risky to work on educating those who have been 
suckered by the propaganda.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Very few people will ever read an essay like I wrote here, or study up on countering government propaganda.</p> <p class="rm-manual">On
 the other hand, likely many people would be interested in attending 
classes on “decision making for hard times”, “protecting your family 
from propaganda”, and “escaping debt slavery”. All of these classes 
would be great opportunities for doing the cultural stewardship I 
describe above.</p> <p class="rm-manual">– – – – – – – –</p><p class="rm-manual">
 For hundreds of years many people worked to better the lives of the 
working class thru teaching them to read and write. Now the working 
class needs to be taught how to think well, and how to avoid being 
suckered into supporting the status quo that makes their lives 
miserable.</p><p class="rm-manual"></p> <p class="rm-manual">An early 
divide-and-conquer wedge was the lie that the professional-worker 
social-class isn’t a subset of the working class. If your income stops, 
when you stop showing up at work, then you are part of the working 
class, regardless if you are hourly or on salary. If your income is from
 interest, dividends, and capital gains, then you aren’t part of the 
working class – are part of the privileged class that runs most western 
governments, and especially the US.</p> <p class="rm-manual">I had a 
year of economics from a professor who could make economics humorous and
 interesting. If he could do that, then others can make it interesting 
to learn how to better your life thru better thinking.</p> <p class="rm-manual">The
 sharp, caustic humor of John Belushi and Eddie Murphy come to mind 
because the humor of both is very pointed, down to earth, and has a lot 
of compassion for the lives of ordinary people.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Humor
 like this could go a long ways to making it fun and useful to attend 
classes on improving your life thru improving your thinking skills.. </p> <p class="rm-manual"></p><p class="rm-manual"></p>

have not heard of him. It is quite shocking that the man who was held 
responsible for the Nanking Massacre was also a Sinophile and an 
advocate of pan-Asiaism ( as I am)! How Japan ended up, not pacifying 
but massacring his brother must be of extreme anguish to him. He even 
said that it was happy that he was made an example. He probably saw 
Chiang as a Hanjian\sellout and think that white people have gotten to 
him. That’s kind of how I see Japanese leadership now! The usual Divide 
and conquer and playing both sides from the White devil. It is sad that,
 despite all the good intentions, war and greed have a logic of its own.
 I think the fundamental problem was that Japan wanted to be the 
leader\centre of this pan-Asia Union, which historically and 
economically, could not have been the case. It makes me think we need a 
very high level of economic and cultural integration in order for the 
pan-Asia Union to succeed. Not only economic power but cultural soft 
power like Manga or South Korean boy band kind of thing. That’s the only
 way pan Asia-ism can succeed. China is lacking in this area and there 
really needs to be a cultural revival that would suck Koreans and 
Japanese into our orbit. I guess this won’t happen when two Chinaman is 
using English to communicate.. Replies: @China Japan and Korea Bromance

 is suspect at best –anyone can pen anything. EG: “Adolf Hitler was a 
secret Jew and built the ovens at Auschwitz so the inmates would enjoy 
apple strudel.” In reality –all those characters in the Yasakuni shrine 
were hardened war crminals. Following German defeat 1918—Germany 
surrendered all colonies and Japan was awarded Shandong —then in 1937 
there was an incident and then the barrage began– Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong
 should know –he is half Japanese. </p> <p class="rm-manual"></p></li>
