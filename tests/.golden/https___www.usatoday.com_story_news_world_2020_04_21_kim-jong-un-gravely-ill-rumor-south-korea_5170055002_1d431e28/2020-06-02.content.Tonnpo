<h1 class="rm-manual">South Korea: No information to corroborate US media report that Kim Jong Un gravely ill</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="file:///staff/2684068001/kim-hjelmgaard/">Kim Hjelmgaard</a></p>
<p class="rm-manual">USA TODAY</p>
<p>South Korea's government said Tuesday it had no information to 
corroborate a media report suggesting that Washington is monitoring 
intelligence indicating North Korea's leader was gravely ill after he 
reportedly underwent heart surgery this month. </p>
<p>Seoul has not detected any unusual activity or signs coming from 
Pyongyang about Kim Jong Un's health, according to Kang Min-seok, a 
spokesman for the Blue House, the office and residence of South Korea 
President Moon Jae-in.</p>
<p>South Korea's statement comes after a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html" rel="noopener">CNN report</a>,
 citing an unnamed U.S. official "with direct knowledge" of the matter, 
said the U.S. is keeping an eye on intelligence suggesting that the 
North Korean leader's health was in "grave danger." A second official 
cited by CNN said the intelligence about Kim's health was credible. The 
official acknowledged it was hard to assess how seriously ill he may be.

<p class="">South Korea: <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/04/14/north-korea-fires-missiles-ground-and-air-south-korea-military/2987647001/" rel="noopener">North Korea fires barrage of missiles from ground and air</a></p>
<p>The North Korean leader's health has long been a focus of 
speculation. He's a heavy smoker and is obese. However, North Korea is 
one of the world's most secretive nations and information about its 
leader is extremely difficult to verify. Even his age is a matter of 
dispute, although most analysts think he's probably 36. </p>
<p>CNN's report late Monday followed a story in a Seoul-based website named <a href="https://www.dailynk.com/english/source-kim-jong-un-recently-received-heart-surgery/" rel="noopener">Daily NK</a>
 run by North Korean defectors. It reported that the North Korean leader
 had undergone heart surgery on April 12 and is recuperating at a villa 
outside the capital, Pyongyang. Daily NK's story is based on a single 
source inside North Korea.</p>
<p>Media reports about North Korea and its leadership have previously 
turned out to be inaccurate. Speculation about Kim Jong Un's health has 
increased in recent days partly because he skipped a recent 
commemoration connected to the nation's founding.</p>
<p>North Korean state media has not addressed Kim's health. The 
state-run Korean Central News Agency released a photo of him, dated 
April 11, which it said shows Kim attending a politburo meeting of the 
ruling Workers' Party of Korea in Pyongyang. However, neither the 
content nor the date of the photo could be independently verified.</p>
<p>North Korea is one of only a handful of nations to refuse to report 
data about coronavirus infections. Negotiations between Washington and 
Pyongyang aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear and ballistic 
missile programs have stalled amid the Trump administration's refusal to
 ease crippling sanctions on North Korea.</p>
<p>In March, Kim Jong Un's regime conducted nine missile tests, the most
 in a single month recorded in a database run by the James Martin Center
 for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of 
International Studies. This month, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/04/14/north-korea-fires-missiles-ground-and-air-south-korea-military/2987647001/" rel="noopener">North Korea launched back-to-back missiles</a>,
 fired from the ground and fighter jets that splashed down into waters 
off the coast of Japan. The missiles were fired on the eve of the state 
anniversary celebrations that Kim Jong Un did not attend in person. </p></article>
