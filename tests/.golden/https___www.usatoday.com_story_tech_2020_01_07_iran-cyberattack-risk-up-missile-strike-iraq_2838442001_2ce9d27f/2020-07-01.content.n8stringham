<h1 class="rm-manual">The risk of an Iran cyberattack is up after missile strike on Iraqi military bases with US troops</h1>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="file:///staff/2647487001/jessica-guynn/">Jessica Guynn</a></p>
<p class="rm-manual">USA TODAY</p>
<p>Americans should be on heightened alert for cyberattacks after <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/01/07/iran-state-tv-tehran-fires-iraqi-base-housing-us-troops-ain-assad/2837693001/" rel="noopener">Iran fired more than a dozen missiles</a> at two military bases in Iraq where U.S. troops are stationed late Tuesday.</p>
<p>The FBI said Wednesday that the bureau is “aware of the continued 
possibility that retaliatory actions could be taken against the United 
States and its interests abroad.”</p>
<p>“While there is no specific or credible threat to the homeland at 
this time, we urge the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious 
activity to law enforcement,” the FBI said.</p>
<p>On Monday Homeland Security <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-006a" rel="noopener">urged cybersecurity teams</a> to "enhance monitoring of network and email traffic," including for email phishing attempts.</p>
<p>Iran, which has been linked to cyber attacks against Saudi Arabia and
 the Sands Las Vegas casino owned by Sheldon Adelson, could target 
private businesses and government infrastructure to avenge last week's 
killing of its top military commander as tensions between Tehran and 
Washington <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/06/iran-tension-soleimani-explainer/2822590001/" rel="noopener">reach one of their highest points</a> since the 1979 Iranian revolution, security researchers say.</p>
<p>In retaliation for the U.S. drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani 
in Baghdad, Iran could go after the power and electricity you use, the 
smart devices you carry or your bank account, they say. </p>
<p>"As these escalations continue to play out and definitely in wake of 
Soleimani's death, America needs to be prepared for retaliation," said 
Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic 
Research Lab. "Are we being attacked online? No, not that we can prove 
and not that is having an impact that is blatant or at scale or moving 
the needle on public conversation or crippling any infrastructure."</p>
<p>Cyberwar with Iran:<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/01/03/how-much-damage-could-iran-cyber-attacks-do/2803599001/" rel="noopener">How vulnerable is America?</a></p>
<p>A cyber conflict has been <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/01/03/how-much-damage-could-iran-cyber-attacks-do/2803599001/" rel="noopener">silently raging for years</a>.
 Even if no attack from Iran occurs in coming weeks, "the danger zone 
will extend for years," warned Steven Bellovin, a computer science 
professor at Columbia University School of Engineering. </p>
<p>For nearly a decade, Iran has been building up its cyber arsenal and 
is now considered among the major nation-state threats to the security 
of the U.S.</p>
<p>"The Iranian regime has demonstrated greater appetite towards 
destructive or disruptive cyber-attacks in peacetime than any other 
nation," <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/en/consulting/our-thinking/understanding-the-cyber-threat-from-iran" rel="noopener">say</a> Ed Parsons and George Michael, who research cyber threats to the private sector.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged last week that Iran could unleash cyberattacks.</p>
<p>“The Iranians have a deep and complex cyber capability, to be sure,” 
Pompeo said on Fox News. “Know that we have certainly considered that 
risk."</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/ntas/alerts/20_0104_ntas_bulletin.pdf" rel="noopener">warned</a>
 Americans that Iran is capable of launching cyberattacks with 
“temporary disruptive effects” against critical U.S. infrastructure, 
though it had “no information indicating a specific, credible threat to 
the Homeland.” </p>
<p>'This was an act of war':<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/07/iran-missile-strikes-us-bases-reaction/2838233001/" rel="noopener">Lawmakers react to Iran's missile strike on US military bases</a></p>
<p>The National Terrorism System advisory recommended that Americans 
take precautions by backing up data and using two-factor authentication 
for sensitive accounts.</p>
<p>Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf <a href="https://twitter.com/DHS_Wolf/status/1213585937881534467" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>
 that the bulletin was intended to “inform &amp; reassure the American 
public, state/local governments &amp; private partners that DHS is 
actively monitoring &amp; preparing for any specific, credible threat, 
should one arise.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, a federal website went offline after a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/05/iran-hack-homeland-security-website-hacked-image-bloody-trump/2818308001/" rel="noopener">hacker uploaded photos to the site that included an Iranian flag and an image depicting a bloodied President Donald Trump</a> being punched in the face.</p>
<p>The images appeared on the Federal Depository Library Program 
program's website late Saturday before the site was taken offline. The 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a division of the 
Department of Homeland Security, said it was monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>"We are aware the website of the Federal Depository Library Program 
was defaced with pro-Iranian, anti-US messaging," the cybersecurity 
agency said in a statement. "At this time, there is no confirmation that
 this was the action of Iranian state-sponsored actors. The website was 
taken offline and is no longer accessible."</p>
<p>The statement added that "in these times of increased threats" all 
organizations should increase cyber monitoring, back up IT systems, 
implement secure authentication and have an incident response plan ready
 should a hack take place.</p>
<p>CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that warned of increasing 
cyberattacks by Iran earlier this year, said Monday that industries such
 as oil and gas and electricity could be targets.</p>
<p>“CrowdStrike Intelligence believes that Iranian adversaries are 
likely to leverage a broad range of means, including cyber operations, 
against U.S. and allied interests,” the company said. “Our current 
assessment is that organizations in the financial, defense, government, 
and oil and gas sectors are the most likely targets for retaliation 
activity.”</p>
<p>What we know:<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/07/u-s-military-bases-attacked-iranian-missiles-what-we-know/2838092001/" rel="noopener">US military bases attacked by Iran have hosted Trump and Pence, damage unclear</a></p>
<p>CrowdStrike said it was monitoring for denial of service and ransomware attacks, tools frequently deployed by Iranian hackers.</p>
<p>Iran intensified its cyber warfare capabilities after the Stuxnet 
computer worm, a program believed to have been run by the United States 
and Israel, was uncovered. The worm destroyed nuclear centrifuges at the
 Natanz uranium enrichment plant.</p>
<p>“Stuxnet caused Iran to really wake up: 'Hey this cyber stuff is 
really powerful. We can do this, too.' And unlike nuclear weapons, it 
doesn’t take a huge industrial infrastructure," Bellovin said.</p>
<p>"Iran’s abilities have gotten noticeably stronger over the last 10 
years," with hackers targeting major U.S. financial institutions, 
universities and companies, he said.</p>
<p>Bellovin warns that it could take years for Iran to launch a 
cyberattack. American companies should shore up their defenses 
accordingly, he said.</p>
<p>"I worry about companies letting down their guard," Bellovin said. 
"If people get an alert and then after three weeks revert to business as
 usual, two years from now they may find themselves hit badly."</p>
