<p>Slain Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani <a href="file:///publications/2020/01/after-soleimani-strike-whats-next-iraq-and-region">played a considerable role in conflicts across the Middle East</a>.
 In Syria, he mobilized Shia armed groups from across the region and 
coordinated closely with Hezbollah to save the Assad regime. His death 
by an American airstrike leaves many to wonder what’s next for Iran in 
Syria. It has also stirred fear of a direct confrontation between 
Washington and Tehran at a time when concerns about an ISIS resurgence 
in both Iraq and Syria are already on the rise. USIP’s Mona Yacoubian 
looks at what, if any change, Soleimani’s death will mean for the Assad 
regime and what’s next in the fight against ISIS.</p>

 Iran has long backed the Assad regime. And while Iran’s military system
 is designed to ensure continuity, Soleimani’s influence among Syrian 
leaders is not easily replaced. What does his death mean for Iran’s 
presence in Syria? Will it change the Assad regime’s posture in anyway? </h3>
<p>Soleimani was a key architect of Iran’s intervention in Syria dating 
to the early days of the conflict. In particular, he leveraged his 
longstanding ties to Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, working
 closely with the Shia militia leader to ensure against the fall of the 
regime of Bashar al-Assad. Soleimani played an outsized role, 
engineering the insertion of thousands of Shia fighters—not only from 
Iran, but also from Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and of course, Lebanon.
 This Shia “foreign legion” was critical to rescuing the Syrian regime, 
bolstering its manpower when the Assad regime’s survival was on the 
line. Their involvement came at an enormous price to Syrian civilians. 
These Iranian-backed Shia militias stand accused of committing numerous 
war crimes and acts of brutality against civilians in Syria.</p>
<p>However, despite Soleimani’s strategic role, his death will not 
diminish Iran’s presence in Syria. Unfortunately, Soleimani’s legacy in 
Syria will outlive him as evidenced by the integration of some 
Iranian-backed armed groups into Syria’s security and military 
structures. These efforts are likely to continue as the regime seeks to 
regain control over the whole of Syria. Soleimani essentially helped lay
 the groundwork for a strategy that is likely to continue for months if 
not years.</p>
<p>Similarly, Soleimani’s death is not likely to impact negatively the 
Assad regime’s posture. In addition to support from Iran, the Assad 
regime relies heavily on its alliance with Russia. In recent months, 
certainly since <a href="file:///blog/2019/10/latest-syria-and-turkey-3-things-you-need-know">Turkey’s October 2019 incursion</a>
 into northeast Syria, Russia’s influence has continued to grow, making 
it the most influential power broker in Syria. In some ways, Soleimani’s
 death may have further assured Russia’s primacy in Syria, depriving 
Iran of a key strategist in its continuing competition with Russia for 
power and influence in Syria.</p>
<h3>As the U.S. prepares for possible retaliation from Iran, the 
Pentagon has suspended its efforts to counter a resurgent ISIS in Iraq 
and Syria. How does Soleimani’s death impact the fight against ISIS, 
both in the short term and into the future?</h3>
<p>Prior to last week, concerns about an ISIS resurgence in both Iraq 
and Syria were on the rise with increased reports of night-time raids, 
sleeper cells, and IED attacks. Already in the short term, the fallout 
from Soleimani’s death appears to have negative ramifications for the 
counter-ISIS campaign. Concerned about force protection, the U.S.-led 
Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS has announced a suspension of its 
operations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iraq’s parliament has issued a nonbinding resolution 
calling for the United States to withdraw its forces from Iraq. Should 
the United States decide or be forced to withdraw its forces from Iraq, 
the counter-ISIS campaign would suffer a significant blow. Operations in
 Syria would also be adversely impacted by a U.S. pullout from Iraq. 
ISIS would likely fill any power vacuums opened by a precipitous U.S. 
withdrawal to reconstitute itself.</p>
<p>Over the longer term, if Soleimani’s death provokes a deeper conflict
 between the United States and Iran, the resulting chaos and instability
 in both Syria and Iraq will benefit ISIS. The extremist group thrives 
under such conditions: it will exploit heightened sectarianism to seek 
additional recruits; prey on Sunni discontent in the wake of festering 
political and socioeconomic ills; and move into ungoverned spaces.</p>
