<p>The United States Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, came under attack on Sunday as multiple rockets were launched at it.</p>
<p>Daily Mail reports that the rockets fired at the Embassy hit an apartment complex instead, killing civilians.</p>
<p>According to residents, three explosions rang out, heard inside the 
heavily-fortified Green Zone, home to the US Embassy and the seat of 
Iraq’s government.</p>
<p>This is following growing tension between the United States and Iran over the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.</p>
<p>Reports say that Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary 
Guards’ elite Quds Force, was killed by the United States forces.</p>

<p>The top Iranian General was killed “at the direction” of Donald Trump, the United States President.</p>
<p>Speaking on Soleimani’s death, a Pentagon statement said, “At the 
direction of the President, the US military has taken decisive defensive
 action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani.”</p>
<p>The statement added that General Soleimani approved the attacks on the embassy.</p>
<p>“This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.</p>
<p>“The United States will continue to take all necessary action to 
protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the 
world,” the statement added.</p>

<p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had vowed to revenge 
Soleimani’s killing, while President Donald Trump warned that the US 
would target 52 sites in the Islamic Republic if Tehran retaliates. <a href="https://www.nan.ng/news/iraq-attacks-u-s-embassy/">NAN</a></p>
