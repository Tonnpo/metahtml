<p>The secretary of State first urged the president to take out Soleimani “months ago.”</p>

<figcaption><span>Donald Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting with Mike Pompeo in October.</span><span>BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images</span></figcaption><p>Though
 he fancies himself a brilliant strategist, it’s broadly understood that
 Donald Trump is the most impressionable person on the planet. He has 
been known to take foreign leaders <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/02/28/putin-kim-jong-un-trump-has-habit-taking-foreign-autocrats-their-word/" rel="nofollow noopener">at their word</a>, is a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/opinions/in-trump-world-flattery-will-get-you-everywhere-and-nowhere-parker/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">sucker for flattery</a>, and will often follow the advice of whoever he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/14/want-to-change-trumps-mind-on-policy-be-the-last-one-who-talks-to-him/" rel="nofollow noopener">last spoke to</a>. So while it was ultimately the president who ordered the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/01/democrats-slam-trump-over-qassem-soleimani-iran">killing</a>
 last week of Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani and brought 
tensions between Washington and Tehran to a head, the origin of that 
idea was initially unclear.</p>
<p>The Washington Post offered an answer to that question late Sunday, 
when it reported that the Soleimani killing was the brainchild of 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence, two of the
 biggest cheerleaders for the military operation in the days since 
Soleimani’s death. The two <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/killing-of-soleimani-follows-long-push-from-pompeo-for-aggressive-action-against-iran-but-airstrike-brings-serious-risks/2020/01/05/092a8e00-2f7d-11ea-be79-83e793dbcaef_story.html" rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly</a>
 urged Trump to order a strike on the general for days in the lead-up to
 the operation as protests raged outside the United States embassy in 
Baghdad. Pompeo had been particularly relentless, reportedly calling for
 the Islamic Revolutionary Guard leader’s death since at least last 
summer. A senior U.S. official told the Post that Pompeo first floated 
killing Soleimani “months ago,” but at the time “neither the president 
nor Pentagon officials were willing to countenance such an operation.”</p>
<p>Per the Post, Pompeo was left “morose” after failing to convince the 
president to retaliate against Iran after it downed a U.S. drone in <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/06/trumps-art-of-the-deal-diplomacy-turn-dangerous-in-iran">June</a>,
 but “recent changes to Trump’s national security team and the whims of a
 president anxious about being viewed as hesitant in the face of Iranian
 aggression” afforded him another opportunity to press for action. 
Importantly, Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper were reportedly in 
“lockstep” when it came to pushing for the strike, though the New York 
Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/us/politics/trump-suleimani.html" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> that Trump’s choice to pursue the most extreme course of action “stunned” Pentagon officials.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, Pompeo and Pence have both staunchly defended the move. Pence <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/01/no-one-knows-where-mike-pence-got-his-soleimani-facts-from">falsely claimed</a>
 in a tweet that Soleimani was directly involved in 9/11, and Pompeo has
 repeatedly said that the killing prevented an “imminent” attack on U.S.
 troops in the region. “We took a bad guy off the battlefield,” Pompeo 
told CNN. “We made the right decision.” On the flip side, if it turns 
out to have been wrong decision—and there’s a very good chance it 
might!—it’ll be Pompeo, Pence, and Esper who will likely answer for it. 
There are already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/us/politics/trump-suleimani.html" rel="nofollow noopener">significant doubts</a> as to whether the new “threat” posed by by Soleimani truly warranted such dramatic action; should Trump’s <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/01/trump-and-iranian-military-leader-rattle-sabers-via-interviews-and-social-media">back-and-forth</a>
 with Iran ultimately embroil the United States in another Middle 
Eastern war, Pompeo and his future political ambitions could go down 
with the ship.</p>
