 - In the latest escalation of tensions between the United States and 
Iran, President Donald Trump on Monday labeled Iran's elite 
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a foreign terrorist organization â€” an 
unprecedented move that marks the first time the U.S. has formally named
 another country's military as terrorists. Experts say the decision will
 likely raise the already strained relationship between the two 
countries to a much higher level.</p>

<p>Here is a look at the history of the IRGC.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Guard Corps, known in Iran as Pasdaran, was founded
 in April 1979 shortly after the Islamic Revolution and the overthrow of
 Iran's pro-western monarch Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. </p>
<p>The IRGC's core task, as mandated by late supreme leader Ayatollah 
Khomeini, is to protect the country's Islamic system and revolutionary 
values. </p>
<p>"In principle, the Iranian state could eventually reform itself 
outside the bounds envisioned by that revolution, in spite of the 
numerous constitutional safeguards Khomeini set up, to include clerical 
oversight of the elected government," said Brad Patty, a former U.S. 
army adviser and analyst. "In practice, the IRGC exists to ensure that 
never happens. The population of Iran may wish what it will, but they 
are meant to live in terror of the IRGC." </p>

targeting the Islamic State group in Syria.</p>
<p>Structure</p>
<p>The IRGC today has become a major military, political and economic 
player in Iran, with an estimated 150,000-strong military consisting of 
ground forces, navy, and air units. It is also in charge of the 
country's ballistic missiles and nuclear programs.</p>
<p>Organizationally, the IRGC falls under the Joint Armed Forces General
 Staff as a part of the Ministry of Defense. But the military remains 
subordinate to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, with elected civilian 
authorities exercising no real control, according to international 
policy organization Counter Extremism Project. </p>
<p>Internally, the IRGC also commands the Basij Resistance Force, a 
religious volunteer group that channels popular support to the regime 
and suppresses domestic dissent. The paramilitary force monitors 
compliance with the country's strict customs, such as arresting women 
who violate the regime's public dress codes and raiding Western-style 
parties where alcohol may be served.</p>
<p>Externally, the IRGC's uses its shadowy Quds Force led by Maj. Gen. 
Qasem Soleimani and proxy Shiite militias such as the Lebanese Hezbollah
 to extend its influence across the Middle East and beyond.</p>

graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>International activities and ties </p>
<p>The elite Quds Force was created during the Iran-Iraq War in 1980 and has about 15,000 personnel. </p>
<p>The group has been involved in Middle East conflicts for decades 
either directly or by providing support to pro-Iranian militias and 
governments, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, the 
Palestinian territories and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>More recently, the Quds Force were crucial to the Syrian civil war by supporting President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels. </p>
<p>In Iraq, the group played a key role in helping the Shiite-dominated 
government in the fight against IS and thwarting a Kurdish bid for 
independence.</p>
<p>The Quds Force is also considered the lifeline of Houthi rebels in 
their struggle against the internationally recognized government in 
Yemen.</p>
<p>World designations </p>
<p>The U.S. designated the Quds Force as a supporter of terrorism as 
early as 2007, followed by Canada in 2012. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, two
 key neighboring rivals to Iran, designated IRGC a terror entity in 
2018. </p>
<p>The United Nations and the European Union have refrained from 
designating the IRGC as a terror entity but have blacklisted key 
individuals of the force, including its leader Qasem Soleimani. </p>

<p>Future </p>
<p>Analysts say the U.S. decision Monday to sanction the IRGC entirely 
will allow Washington to introduce further sanctions on Iran in the 
future as a part of the Trump administration's strategy of putting 
"maximum pressure" on the Iranian regime.</p>
<p>The sanctions will particularly affect the business sector in Iran, 
given the IRGC's involvement in economic activities, an analyst and 
journalist based in Tehran told VOA on the condition of anonymity 
because of potential scrutiny by the government. </p>
<p>"This sanction with its huge economic and travel limitations on IRGC 
is not limited to the unit itself. The IRGC is a multibillion dollar 
conglomerate economic cartel which controls organizations, companies and
 entities across the country and overseas. With this sanction, the fate 
of individuals and other companies who have business ties with it will 
be affected."</p>
<p>Analysts charge the sanctions will likely cross Iranian borders into 
other countries in the region where the IRGC has established influence 
and footprints. </p>
<p>Mike Pregent, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told VOA the 
U.S. move would most likely be influential in draining the stream of 
support to militant groups such as the Houthis in Yemen and could push 
governments away from being Iranian proxies.</p>
<p>"This is a chance for Iraq to distant itself from Iran," Pregent 
said, adding that the Iranian IRGC has used Iraq's Popular Mobilization 
Forces to directly shape governance in Iraq.</p>
<p>At the same time, the designation would likely put countries that 
wish to establish balanced relations with the U.S. and Iran in a 
difficult position, according to some experts.</p>
<p>Barbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the 
Atlantic Council, said the U.S. sanctions would likely put immense 
pressure on Iraq and Lebanon, where pro-Iranian militants enjoy a lot of
 influence outside the military apparatus. </p>
<p>"It will certainly strengthen pro-Iran groups in Iraq calling for the
 expulsion of U.S. troops and, I believe, it will decrease U.S. 
influence, as Iran is not going anywhere, while Trump is cutting both 
troops and aid," she said. </p>
