<p>Last year, U.S. President Donald Trump labeled Iran’s elite Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a foreign terrorist organization, an 
unprecedented move that marked the first time the United States had 
formally named another country’s military terrorists. Experts said then 
that the decision would likely raise to a higher level the strained 
relationship between the two countries.</p>
<p>Here is a look at the history of the IRGC:</p>
<p>Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, known in Iran as Pasdaran, was 
founded in April 1979 shortly after the Islamic Revolution and the 
overthrow of Iran’s pro-Western monarch Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi.</p>
<figcaption>FILE - A man holds a picture of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
 founder of the Islamic Republic, as government supporters protest 
against opposition demonstrations during the holy day of Ashura, in 
Tehran, Dec. 30 2009.</figcaption><p>The IRGC’s core task, as mandated 
by the late Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, is to protect the 
country’s Islamic system and revolutionary values.</p>
<p>“In principle, the Iranian state could eventually reform itself 
outside the bounds envisioned by that revolution, in spite of the 
numerous constitutional safeguards Khomeini set up, to include clerical 
oversight of the elected government,” said Brad Patty, a former U.S. 
army adviser and analyst. “In practice, the IRGC exists to ensure that 
never happens. The population of Iran may wish what it will, but they 
are meant to live in terror of the IRGC.”</p>
<figcaption>FILE - Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei talks to clerics in his Islamic thoughts class in Tehran, Iran, Nov. 17, 2019.</figcaption><p>Structure</p>
<p>The IRGC today has become a major military, political and economic 
player in Iran, with an estimated 150,000-strong military consisting of 
ground forces, navy and air units. It is also in charge of the country’s
 ballistic missiles and nuclear programs.</p>
<p>Organizationally, the IRGC falls under the Joint Armed Forces General
 Staff as a part of the Ministry of Defense. But the military remains 
subordinate to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, with elected civilian 
authorities exercising no real control, according to the international 
policy organization Counter Extremism Project.</p>
<p>Internally, the IRGC also commands the Basij Resistance Force, a 
religious volunteer group that channels popular support to the regime 
and suppresses domestic dissent. The paramilitary force monitors 
compliance with the country’s strict customs, such as arresting women 
who violate the regime’s public dress codes and raiding Western-style 
parties where alcohol may be served.</p>
<p>Externally, the IRGC uses its shadowy Quds Force, that was led by 
Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and proxy Shi’ite militias, such as the 
Lebanese Hezbollah, to extend its influence across the Middle East and 
beyond.</p>
<p>International activities and ties</p>
<p>The elite Quds Force was created during the Iran-Iraq War in 1980 and has about 15,000 personnel.</p>
<p>The group has been involved in Middle East conflicts for decades 
either directly or by providing support to pro-Iranian militias and 
governments, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, the 
Palestinian territories and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>More recently, the Quds Force was crucial to the Syrian civil war by supporting President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels.</p>
<p>In Iraq, the group played a key role in helping the Shiite-dominated 
government in the fight against IS and thwarting a Kurdish bid for 
independence.</p>
<p>The Quds Force is also considered the lifeline of Houthi rebels in 
their struggle against the internationally recognized government in 
Yemen.</p>
<p>World designations</p>
<p>The U.S. designated the Quds Force as a supporter of terrorism as 
early as 2007, followed by Canada in 2012. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, two
 key neighboring rivals to Iran, designated IRGC a terror entity in 
2018.</p>
<p>The United Nations and the European Union have refrained from 
designating the IRGC as a terror entity but have blacklisted key 
individuals of the force, including its leader Qassem Soleimani.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> Iran's Revolutionary Guard, designated a "foreign 
terrorist organization" by the Trump administration on Monday, evolved 
from a paramilitary, domestic security force with origins in the 1979 
Islamic Revolution to a transnational force that has come to the aid of 
Tehran's allies in the Mideast, from Syria and Lebanon to Iraq.The force
 answers only to Iran's supreme leader, operates independently of the 
regular military and has vast economic interests across the country. </p>
