<p class="rm-manual"> <span> By <span> <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/max-fisher"><span>Max Fisher</span></a> </span> <span> Updated Jul 14, 2015, 2:12pm EDT </span> </span> </p>
<p>International negotiators assembled in Austria have announced the final terms of the Iranian nuclear deal. <span>The
 purpose of the deal is to limit Iran's nuclear program to something 
that is small, safe, and peaceful — and to impose lots of invasive 
inspections to make sure Iran is keeping to its end of the deal. In 
exchange, Iran gets relief from some of the economic sanctions that have
 crippled its economy. Both sides, the thinking goes, also get to avert a
 war.</span></p>
<p>You can really see how that plays out, how the deal works, and what 
it means when you look into its details. But those details can get 
awfully technical. So w<span>hat follows are the most important 
provisions of the deal, along with a simple translation of each into 
plain English and a brief description of why it matters:</span></p>
<h3>Centrifuges</h3>
<p>Term: Iran will be allowed about 6,000 centrifuges in all: 5,060 that
 can enrich uranium at its Natanz facility and another 1,000 at Fordow, 
where they can be used for non-fissile research. It can only use 
first-generation IR-1 centrifuges, and has to give up other models, 
although several years down the line will be allowed to develop slightly
 more advanced models.</p>
<p>Plain English: Centrifuges are pieces of equipment you use to enrich 
uranium, a natural ore, into nuclear fuel. If you enrich uranium long 
enough in centrifuges, it can be used to make a nuclear bomb. Iran 
currently has about 20,000 centrifuges, so it will have to give most of 
them up. It will also be allowed to use only its very old, 
first-generation centrifuges.</p>
<p>Why it matters: This means Iran will have a much smaller nuclear 
program, in terms of its ability to create nuclear fuel or, potentially,
 nuclear material for a bomb. It will also be restricted to its oldest, 
slowest, least capable centrifuges for a number of years. This means 
that Iran's nuclear program just does not have the capability to do very
 much, and if Iran decides to break the deal and build a nuclear bomb, 
it will take them much longer.</p>
<h3>Uranium enrichment</h3>
<p>Term: Iran will be allowed to enrich uranium to only to 3.67 percent.</p>
<p>Plain English: Iran will be allowed to turn raw uranium into the kind
 of fuel that can be used for a nuclear power plant. But nothing more.</p>
<p>Why it matters: Iran can have nuclear fuel, and it can make nuclear 
fuel, but it has to stop way, way short of making or having anything 
that could be used for a nuclear bomb (about 90 percent enriched).</p>
<h3>Uranium stockpile</h3>
<p>Term: Iran will be required to reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms.</p>
<p>Plain English: Iran has to give up a stunning 97 percent of its nuclear stockpile.</p>
<p>Why it matters: <span>This means that Iran will have a lot less 
nuclear material on hand, so that if it ever decides to break the 
agreement and build a bomb it will have very little capacity to do so. 
The upshot is that Iran's "breakout time" — the time it would take them 
to put together enough weapons-grade uranium for one bomb — has been 
extended from about 2-3 months to a full year. That's good because it is
 more than enough time for the world to catch Iran — and stop them, if 
necessary by force — before they get the bomb.</span></p>
<h3>Sanctions relief</h3>
<p>Term: Iran must fulfill its initial commitments by mid-October, after
 which the International Atomic Energy Agency will verify Iran's 
compliance by mid-December. Once it has verifiably fulfilled its 
commitments, the United States, European Union, and United Nations 
Security Council will begin to remove their nuclear-related sanctions on
 Iran.</p>
<p>Plain English: First there's a process for making sure Iran has done 
all the things that the deal requires them to do, and that will take a 
few months, but after that the sanctions start coming off pretty 
quickly. Iran's economy will probably start seeing the benefit in early 
2016.</p>
<p>Why it matters: Sanctions relief is a huge issue for Iran — this is 
their reward for surrendering so much of their nuclear program and 
submitting to invasive inspections. If the verification process goes to 
plan, and it probably will, then they'll see the benefit quite quickly.</p>
<h3>Sanctions snap-back</h3>
<p>Term: If one of the parties to the deal believes Iran is violating 
the deal, they can submit a complaint to an eight-member panel 
(consisting of <span>the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia, China, and 
Iran itself, as well as the EU) for review. The panel has at least 35 
days to resolve the complaint, but its decisions aren't binding. If the 
party doesn't like the panel's decision, it</span><span> can force the 
UN Security Council to actively approve the process of lifting 
sanctions. If the vote fails, or if the United States vetoes, then the 
sanctions will automatically "snap back" into place.</span></p>
<p>Plain English: If someone thinks Iran is cheating on the deal, they 
can send it to the UN Security Council. The sanctions will come back on 
unless a majority votes to keeping the sanctions — and none of the 
permanent members, including the US, vetoes. If the US or a majority of 
member-states think Iran is cheating, then at least in theory the 
sanctions will go back on.</p>
<p>Why it matters: The idea here is to make it very easy for the US to 
force the United Nations to re-impose sanctions on Iran if they think 
Iran is cheating — and really hard for China or Russia to keep sanctions
 off. This is all about enforcing the deal, and making it easy for the 
US to threaten re-imposing sanctions if Iran cheats, so that Iran won't 
risk cheating.</p>
<h3>Nuclear facilities</h3>
<p>Term: Iran will be allowed to use its nuclear facility at Natanz for 
enrichment. It can also use its facility at Fordow for research as a 
nuclear physics lab, but no fissile material will be allowed there.</p>
<p>Plain English: Iran will be allowed to keep using its once-secret 
"hardened facilities" — big structures with heavy blast walls to protect
 from attack — at sites known as Natanz and Fordow. Iran can keep using 
the one at Natanz to make nuclear fuel. It can keep using the facility 
at Fordow for what sounds like fairly limited nuclear research.</p>
<p>Why it matters: Iran really wanted to keep access to these 
facilities, partly as a matter of national pride. International 
inspectors will have access, so they won't really function as covert 
nuclear facilities anymore. And the stuff Iran gets to do with them is 
pretty limited. Everybody wins.</p>
<h3>Plutonium plant at Arak</h3>
<p>Term: Iran will be required to rebuild its plutonium plant at Arak 
such that it will only make energy-grade plutonium, and will ship out 
its spent plutonium. It is barred from heavy-water reactor use.</p>
<p>Plain English: Iran had built a facility at Arak for making and 
storing potentially weapons-grade plutonium. Now, it will repurpose the 
facility to only make nuclear fuel.</p>
<p>Why it matters: You can make a nuclear bomb with one of two fuels: 
uranium or plutonium. The other parts of the deal limit and restrict 
what Iran can do with uranium. This part of the deal removes 
weapons-grade plutonium from the equation and only allows fuel-grade 
plutonium for powering a power plant.</p>
<h3>Inspections</h3>
<p>Term: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors will have 
access to Iran's nuclear sites, the uranium mines and mills, centrifuge 
factories, and supply chains. It will monitor dual-use technologies. It 
can access "suspicious sites." One caveat is that certain military sites
 will be covered under "<a href="https://www.iiss.org/en/regions/iran/inspecting-iran-anywhere-but-not-anytime-ce4d">managed access</a>," which means Iran gets some say in how those inspections occur.</p>
<p>Plain English: Inspectors will be regularly checking out all of the 
known places that Iran would use for any kind of nuclear work, and even 
many things only just sort of related to nuclear work. It can also 
investigate anything suspicious that pops up. Iran still has a degree of
 sovereignty over certain military sites, but does ultimately have to 
grant inspectors access.</p>
<p>Why it matters: Inspectors, by gaining access to not just the core 
nuclear sites but also secondary things like uranium mills and 
centrifuge plants, will be in a really good position to make sure Iran 
isn't cheating on a deal or trying to squirrel away nuclear material for
 a secret weapons program. If Iran does try to cheat, the world will be 
much more likely to know, and will know much more quickly. While 
"managed access" means there are certain facilities that inspectors 
can't just storm into whenever they want, these are the most invasive 
inspections we could possibly hope for without straight-up invading and 
conquering Iran, and inspectors will still be able to detect any over 
nuclear activity at the "managed access" sites.</p>
