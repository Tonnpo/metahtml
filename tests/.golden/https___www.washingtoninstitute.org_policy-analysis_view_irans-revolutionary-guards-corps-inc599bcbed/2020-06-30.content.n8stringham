<p>Understanding the impact of Washington's expected designation of 
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist 
organization requires knowing what role the Revolutionary Guards play in
 Iranian society. Apart from being a military force with naval, air, and
 ground components organized in parallel to the conventional Iranian 
military, the Revolutionary Guards are the spine of the current 
political structure and a major player in the Iranian economy.</p>
<p>Backbone of the Regime</p>
<p>In his 1988 last will and testament, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini 
called on the military forces "to follow the regulation of 
non-interference of the military in the affairs of political parties" 
and "keep themselves away from political games." In the years since, the
 opposite has occurred. Once a theocratic state, the Islamic Republic 
has evolved into a "garrison state," to use an American political 
science term, in which the military dominates political, economic, and 
cultural life, and preserves the regime from domestic rather than 
external opponents. The Iranian constitution forbids the supreme leader 
from being fully autocratic, but Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has used his 
position as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, especially his tight
 control over the Revolutionary Guards, to expand his power.</p>
<p>Khamenei has appointed many former Revolutionary Guards commanders to
 top political positions, blurring the line between military and civil 
authority. Former IRGC senior officers hold significant positions 
throughout the Iranian government: the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinezhad; 
the secretary of the Supreme Council of National Security, Ali Larijani;
 the head of state television and radio services, Ezzatolah Zarghami; 
the secretary of the Expediency Council (charged with interpreting 
policy when the president and Majlis disagree), Mohsen Rezai; and the 
head of the powerful Mostazafan Foundation, Mohammad Farouzandeh; as 
well as several cabinet ministers and many members of parliament 
(Majlis).</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Guards actively prevent steps toward democratic 
reforms. For example, in 1999, following student protests, the 
conservative newspaper Jomhouri-e Eslami published a letter by 
twenty-four Revolutionary Guards senior officers to the reformist 
president Mohammad Khatami. The Revolutionary Guards, the letter 
threatened, "cannot tolerate the situation anymore" and would take 
action if Khatami did not change his policies. It was no idol threat. 
The IRGC's "Special Force" is trained for scenarios of suppressing 
political or social uprisings in urban settings -- especially in Tehran.
 </p>
<p>The Revolutionary Guards also possess their own large and capable 
intelligence agency. The "Unit of Reservation of Information" exists in 
parallel with and is quite influential within the Ministry of 
Intelligence. Like the ministry, the Revolutionary Guards' intelligence 
unit operates both within Iran and abroad. The IRGC also has 
responsibility for Iran's strategic missile force of Shahab missiles and
 is thought to control the country's suspected nuclear weapons program. 
Several Revolutionary Guards commanders have been named in UN Security 
Council resolutions applying sanctions intended to force Iran to reveal 
more information about nuclear projects.</p>
<p>Economic Force</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Guards are also an important component of the 
Iranian economy. They operate legal businesses, register themselves as 
foreign companies, and engage in illegal smuggling.</p>
<p>Following the end of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988, the Majlis enacted 
legislation permitting the IRGC to use "its engineering capability in 
rebuilding the country's economy." However, no oversight body exists 
with the capability of supervising the Revolutionary Guards' economic 
activities. IRGC-owned companies like the Bahman Group, which assembles 
Mazda cars in Iran, are examples of the Revolutionary Guards' expansion 
into a variety of economic sectors. </p>
<p>Speaking at a ceremony announcing a $1.3 billion no-bid contract 
between Iran's Oil Ministry and the Khatam al-Anbia firm in June 2006, 
Revolutionary Guards Brig. Abdurreza Abedzadeh, Khatam al-Anbia's 
reconstruction deputy, stated that the company had completed 1,220 
industrial and mining projects over the previous sixteen years, with 247
 projects currently underway. Three days later, a $2.4 billion contract 
was concluded with the Tehran Metro Company between the IRGC-owned 
National Company of Building working with the Mostazafan Foundation. The
 Oil Ministry also ceded the fifteenth and sixteenth phases of expansion
 of the South Pars oil field to Khatam al-Anbia under a $2.5 billion 
contract. In July 2007, the Ministry of Energy agreed that Revolutionary
 Guards contractors would operate all public infrastructures projects 
involving water, electricity, and bridges in western Iran. All contracts
 were awarded on a no-bid basis in violation of Iranian law on open 
bidding processes. </p>
<p>In 1999, then-speaker of the Majlis Mehdi Karrubi explicitly detailed
 the sixty unauthorized docks controlled by the Revolutionary Guards. 
Ali Qanbari, then a Majlis member, further explained, "One-third of 
country's import takes place through illegal markets, underground 
economy, and unauthorized docks". Several hours after the May 8, 2004, 
official opening of the new Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran, the 
Revolutionary Guards closed it, citing security fears over the presence 
of the Turkish-Austrian consortium Tepe-Akfen-Vie. Iranian sources later
 revealed that the Revolutionary Guards had been using the old airport 
to import goods tariff-free and feared losing that ability. </p>
<p>Some reports suggest that the Revolutionary Guards have used force to
 assume control of large economic projects. In July 2005, soon after 
Oriental Oil Kish, one of the largest private oil companies in Iran, 
refused the IRGC's demand for equal partnership, Cyrus Nasseri, the 
company's vice-chairman and a senior nuclear negotiator, was arrested 
and the Revolutionary Guards seized an offshore oil rig being rented by 
Oriental Oil from a Romanian firm. The Fars News Agency later wrote that
 negotiations were underway to transfer the ownership of the company to 
the Revolutionary Guards. Under the banner of economic privatization, 
the government has circumvented Iranian law to cede ownership of public 
companies to the Revolutionary Guards at below-market prices through 
no-bid contracts. </p>
<p>Less information is available about the Revolutionary Guards' role in
 foreign firms ostensibly belonging to private individuals. Many rumors,
 of uncertain accuracy, circulate, for instance about al-Makassib, a 
huge company based in Dubai. It is not clear who controls the firm, 
though its most public face is that of Nasser Vaez Tabassi, apparently a
 U.S. citizen, who is the son of Ayatollah Abbas Vaez Tabassi, one of 
the most powerful men in Iran in his role as the custodian of the Imam 
Reza Holy Shrine in Mashhad, which the Wall Street Journal describes as a
 $6 billion a year enterprise. </p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Iranian writers widely use the economic jargon "rent-seeking" to 
describe those who prosper thanks to their political connections rather 
than their business acumen. Under Khamenei, the role of the 
Revolutionary Guards has expanded exponentially. Under Ahmadinezhad, the
 IRGC's influence in government ministries and state firms has grown 
apace. Its next target may be the Majlis. Ahead of a July 2007 
registration deadline, more than fifty Revolutionary Guards commanders 
resigned in order to qualify as candidates for the next parliamentary 
election. </p>
<p>The IRGC is a major obstacle to democratization and economic 
privatization. Imposing sanctions on the Revolutionary Guards could help
 promote democratic reform and stability in the region. However, choking
 off the IRGC's financial resources will not be easy; it is quite adept 
at diversifying its sophisticated economic activities. The Revolutionary
 Guards have demonstrated both skill in politics and contempt for the 
law. As former Washington Institute visiting fellow Mohsen Sazegara, a 
founder of the IRGC in 1979, put it, "What was once a revolutionary 
guard is now a mafia." </p>
