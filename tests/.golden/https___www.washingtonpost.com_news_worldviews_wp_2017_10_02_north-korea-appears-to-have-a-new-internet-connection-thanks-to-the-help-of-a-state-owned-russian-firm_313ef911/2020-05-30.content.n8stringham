<h1 class="rm-manual">North Korea appears to have a new Internet connection — thanks to the help of a state-owned Russian firm</h1>

<p>A state-owned Russian telecommunications firm has given North Korea a
 new Internet connection, potentially increasing Pyongyang's ability to 
stage cyberattacks and protect the embattled country's online 
infrastructure.</p>
<p>The new connection was first spotted by Internet analysts at Oracle 
Dyn, who noted that a new connection for North Koreans provided by the 
Russian firm TransTeleCom appeared in Internet routing databases about 
5:38 p.m. Pyongyang time Sunday.</p>
<p>The new connection appears to supplement a connection run by China 
Unicom that has operated since 2010. With two connections, experts 
argue, North Korean Internet users could expect a higher international 
bandwidth capacity as well as a greater ability to withstand attacks.</p>
<p>“In practical terms, [having multiple connections] will allow 
additional resiliency if one of those connections were to be rendered 
inactive for any number of reasons,” said Doug Madory, director of 
Internet analysis at Oracle Dyn.</p>
<p>The new connection “will improve the resiliency of their network and 
increase their ability to conduct command and control over those 
activities,” Bryce Boland, cybersecurity firm FireEye’s chief technology
 office for the Asia-Pacific region, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nkorea-internet/russian-firm-provides-new-internet-connection-to-north-korea-idUSKCN1C70D2">told Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>On Saturday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-signed-presidential-directive-ordering-actions-to-pressure-north-korea/2017/09/30/97c6722a-a620-11e7-b14f-f41773cd5a14_story.html?utm_term=.09dfd8ce99f0&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_9">The Washington Post reported</a>
 that a U.S. Cyber Command operation had targeted hackers at North 
Korea’s military spy agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The U.S.
 operation used what is known as a denial-of-service attack, choking off
 access to the Internet for North Korean users. It ended Saturday, 
shortly before North Korea's new Internet connection went online.</p>
<p>Martyn Williams, an expert on North Korean technology who first reported on the new connection at the <a href="https://www.38north.org/2017/10/mwilliams100117/">website 38 North</a>,
 wrote that “relying on one Internet provider has always left North 
Korea in a precarious situation.” In 2014, after a cyberattack on Sony 
Pictures that was widely attributed to North Korea, the country suddenly
 lost its connection to the Internet in what <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/23/world/asia/attack-is-suspected-as-north-korean-internet-collapses.html?mcubz=3">many suspected</a> was U.S. retaliation.</p>
<p>TransTeleCom is part of Russian Railways, a huge state-owned 
infrastructure and transport company formerly headed by Vladimir 
Yakunin, a U.S.-censured former KGB agent considered a close ally of 
Russian President Vladimir Putin. Although Yakunin was reportedly ousted
 in 2015, the organization still has deep ties to the president, experts
 say.</p>
<p>“This means that the opening of the connection has Russian government
 backing behind it,” said Andrei Soldatov, co-author of the book “<a href="https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B012271TXA&amp;preview=newtab&amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_R.fPzbFQSTPXD&amp;tag=thewaspos09-20">The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia's Digital Dictators and the New Online Revolutionaries</a>.”</p>
<p>TransTeleCom did not respond to a request for comment, but a spokesman for the company told <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d1d48dd0-5366-3fd8-b0bc-bcab64101a17">the Financial Times</a>
 that it has a long relationship with Pyongyang and has “historically 
had a backbone network interface with North Korea under an agreement 
with Korea Posts and Telecommunications Corp. struck in 2009.”</p>
<p>Madory said it was not clear to him exactly how TransTeleCom built 
the infrastructure needed for the new network. If it needed to lay fiber
 optic lines, it would likely have taken “days or weeks,” Madory said, 
though that installation time may have been shorter if there was 
existing infrastructure that could have been reused.</p>
<p>U.S. officials say that as China has increased economic pressure on 
North Korea in line with U.N. sanctions, Russian entrepreneurs have 
stepped into the gap, quietly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-russia-quietly-undercuts-sanctions-intended-to-stop-north-koreas-nuclear-program/2017/09/11/f963867e-93e4-11e7-8754-d478688d23b4_story.html?utm_term=.e8226fe16c3b&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_20">undermining sanctions</a>
 with illicit trade and smuggling. In an email, Kent Boydston of the 
Peterson Institute for International Economics said it was unclear if 
the new network broke any sanctions.</p>
<p>“Telecommunications haven’t been specifically targeted by U.N. 
Security Council resolutions, although it’s hard to see how this 
wouldn’t violate UNSCR 2375’s proscription of joint ventures with the 
North Korean government,” Boydston wrote, referring to the strict 
sanctions imposed <a href="http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/2375">in September by the United Nations</a>.</p>
<p>The new network was an “example of Russia stepping in once North 
Korea feels pressure,” said Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the 
Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former U.S. Treasury 
Department official.</p>
