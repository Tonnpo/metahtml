<h1 class="rm-manual">In Seattle, a soccer match during the coronavirus feels both routine and extraordinary</h1>

<p class="rm-manual">SEATTLE — The puzzled fan had to repeat the question.</p>
<p>“Why am I here?” Brian Lamb asked. “Why wouldn’t I be here?”</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/acq/#/offers/promo/o24_ma" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Support our journalism. Subscribe today.</span>arrow-right</a></p>
<p>He put his right hand on the bill of his gray Seattle Sounders FC 
2019 MLS Cup champions hat. He sipped his beverage. He looked briefly at
 the television in a sports bar called “The Ninety,” an aptly named 
soccer hub near CenturyLink Field. It was about 75 minutes before his 
team — the defending champion — would face the Columbus Crew on an 
achingly beautiful Saturday night, a respite from winter’s gloom. For 
the 48-year-old carpenter, this was just routine March entertainment and
 bonding time with his adult son, Luke. But in an area regarded as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/08/coronavirus-live-updates/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4">U.S. epicenter of a novel coronavirus outbreak</a>, the typical act somehow felt extraordinary, awkward and maybe even dangerous.</p>
<p>Why are you outside having fun? For many, the worth of public 
enjoyment is a question now in Washington state as the vicious covid-19 
disease claims more victims. The local death toll had climbed to 18 as 
of Sunday night, and the total cases here surpassed 100. Worldwide, 
there are now more than 100,000 reported cases and more than 3,000 
deaths.</p>
<p>Sports are usually about diversion, fellowship and, above all, joy. 
There’s some trivial pain involved, too, particularly when your team 
loses. But for the most part, there’s no real suffering. There’s no real
 anything. You just relish the ability to get worked up over the blessed
 inconsequential spectacle of it all. It’s a wonderful shelter, but it’s
 not impenetrable. As the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8">coronavirus</a> spreads worldwide, sports cannot be the escape it is known to be.</p>
<p>In Washington state, Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency 
and encouraged social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. 
Businesses and schools are closing. Movie theaters are empty. 
Reservations aren’t essential for fancy restaurants. Seattle is far from
 a ghost town, but the city sleeps currently — with one eye open.</p>
<p>Lamb shrugged.</p>
<p>“No worries, honestly,” he said. “Practice normal hygiene methods. 
That’s no different than the flu, and we deal with that every year.”</p>
<p>After I expressed concern that he was being too cavalier, Lamb hedged
 a little and acknowledged the risks. But he refused to panic.</p>
<p>“You can’t be scared of the unknown,” he said. “I run into people 
every day making bad decisions because they’re scared of the unknown.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/07/coronavirus-continues-its-rapid-spread-confounding-efforts-by-global-leaders/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_16">Efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak show signs of faltering</a></p>
<p>On Saturday night, Lamb was among an announced crowd of 33,080 fans 
who went to CenturyLink Field and did the most natural thing in this 
soccer-rabid region. They came to watch their beloved Sounders play. It 
was an entertaining match that finished in a 1-1 tie.</p>
<p>Most nights, people at home would be envious of what those spectators experienced. This time? Nah, probably not.</p>
<p>The announced attendance — which probably was a few thousand more 
generous than the actual number of attendees — represented the smallest 
MLS regular season audience the Sounders have had since their inaugural 
season in 2009. The previous Sunday, when details of the outbreak were 
just emerging, a crowd of 40,126 gathered at CenturyLink Field for the 
season opener. They reminisced and celebrated last season’s championship
 as the franchise unveiled the second MLS Cup banner in team history.</p>
<p>As he talked with his father Saturday, Luke Lamb thought back to 
November’s triumph and the energy pulsating through the city that day. 
Before the title match, thousands of fans overtook Occidental Square and
 the surrounding streets and participated in the team’s March to the 
Match tradition. And now, four months later, look at this. There were 
only hundreds of marchers Saturday.</p>
<p>“It was a different feeling,” the 21-year-old said.</p>
<p>Before the fans marched, the pregame host declared: “I don’t think 
there will be much of a line as you enter the stadium. So enjoy that.”</p>

<p>Minutes later, the marching crowd was singing one of its favorite 
songs, “Sounders ’Til I Die.” Yes, it would be quite melodramatic to 
consider the chanting number some kind of metaphor. But in this current 
state, one in which even toilet paper is sold out at stores and every 
cough makes the heart beat a little faster, it was impossible not to 
have an eerie feeling listening to the lyrics. So irrational. So human, 
too.</p>
<p>Normal is weird, and normal is going to feel weird for quite a while.
 The Sounders game was the largest Seattle sports gathering for a single
 game over the past week, and the franchise had to operate with more 
diligence and collaboration than ever to keep adjusting to an 
ever-changing situation and make the decision to play.</p>
<p>Listen to the Sounders explain their process, and it illuminates the 
difficult choices facing every sports league in America and throughout 
the world. The priority is public safety, but business is a major 
factor. There’s also a civic responsibility to try to entertain during a
 difficult time. There are medical factors, political factors, societal 
factors and historical factors. There are so many possibilities to 
weigh. Play, postpone or cancel? Compete in an empty venue? How to send 
the proper message to athletes, fans and media? How to determine the 
right thing to do knowing that everything is fluid?</p>
<p>“It was an extraordinary week,” said Peter Tomozawa, the Sounders’ 
president of business operations. “It was anything but normal. We spent 
an incredible amount of time thinking through all the issues of hosting a
 game, the permutations and combinations of what might happen, with one 
thought: public safety. We recognize the responsibility that we have to 
the community. People are looking at us and how we behave here in 
Seattle.”</p>

<p>The organization seemed to handle the burden responsibly. It provided
 the public with more than two hours of diversion Saturday. It is normal
 for the Sounders this time of year, but now it’s a monumental feat. And
 just because it seemed to work for them on this day, there’s no telling
 what challenges tomorrow may present.</p>
<p>It seems inevitable that, at some point, a major American sporting 
event — or possibly a grander event such as the Olympics — will have to 
make the difficult decision to postpone, cancel or play without fans. It
 could be forced by civic leaders. Or it could be a proactive choice. 
Whatever the form, history suggests that moment is coming if the spread 
continues. And the sports world will just have to live with it. It’s 
better than the dire alternative of more people dying.</p>
<p>“In reality, what we’re doing is more of a hobby for everybody,” 
Sounders midfielder Gustav Svensson said. “We’re very fortunate to have 
it as a job. We understand that safety comes first.”</p>
<p>As he walked through the stadium Saturday, Tomozawa heard positive 
feedback. The fans who attended were enthusiastic. The precautionary 
measures, such as extra hand sanitizers and embedded tips to reduce risk
 for contracting coronavirus into every aspect of the game presentation,
 could not be ignored. The soccer was good for an early-season game. The
 Sounders left, at least for the night, without any bad news.</p>
<p>“One of the things people would say was: ‘Thank you for hosting this 
event tonight. It gave us and our city something to cheer about,’ ” 
Tomozawa recalled.</p>
<p>Here in the U.S. epicenter of the outbreak, sports managed to be 
sports Saturday night. In this time of health crisis, it seemed more 
remarkable than routine.</p>
