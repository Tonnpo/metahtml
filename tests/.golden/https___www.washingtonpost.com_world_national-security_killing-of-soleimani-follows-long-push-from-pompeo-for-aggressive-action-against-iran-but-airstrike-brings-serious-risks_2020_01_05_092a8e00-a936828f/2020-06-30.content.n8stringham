<p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo woke on Tuesday to a 4 a.m. call 
alerting him to a large protest outside the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.</p>
<p>As demonstrators began hurling molotov cocktails at the heavily 
fortified compound, Pompeo grappled with the new security threat to his 
diplomats in phone calls starting at 4:30 a.m. with Defense Secretary 
Mark T. Esper, Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, and Matthew Tueller, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, according to 
U.S. officials.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/acq/#/offers/promo/o24_ma" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Support our journalism. Subscribe today.</span>arrow-right</a></p>
<p>The secretary also spoke to President Trump multiple times every day 
last week, culminating in Trump’s decision to approve the killing of 
Iran’s top military commander, Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, at the urging 
of Pompeo and Vice President Pence, the officials said, speaking on the 
condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.</p>
<p>Pompeo had lost a similar high-stakes deliberation last summer when 
Trump declined to retaliate militarily against Iran after it downed a 
U.S. surveillance drone, an outcome that left Pompeo “morose,” according
 to one U.S. official. But recent changes to Trump’s national security 
team and the whims of a president anxious about being viewed as hesitant
 in the face of Iranian aggression created an opening for Pompeo to 
press for the kind of action he had been advocating.</p>
<p>The greenlighting of the airstrike near Baghdad airport represents a 
bureaucratic victory for Pompeo, but it also carries multiple serious 
risks: another protracted regional war in the Middle East; retaliatory 
assassinations of U.S. personnel stationed around the world; an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/05/us/politics/us-isis-iran.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">interruption</a> in the battle against the Islamic State; the <a href="https://twitter.com/John_Hudson/status/1213885314265178115">closure</a> of diplomatic pathways to containing Iran’s nuclear program; and a major backlash in Iraq, whose parliament <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/05/world/middleeast/iran-general-soleimani-iraq.html?campaign_id=60&amp;instance_id=0&amp;segment_id=20066&amp;user_id=3de934acff0c3dedcbf24e3a4002373e&amp;regi_id=50019658">voted</a> on Sunday to expel all U.S. troops from the country.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/body-of-commander-slain-by-us-strike-arrives-in-iran-to-crowds-of-mourners/2020/01/05/4ca3281a-2f17-11ea-bffe-020c88b3f120_story.html?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_9">Iran says it is suspending all commitments to 2015 Iran nuclear deal</a></span></p>
<p>For Pompeo, whose political ambitions are a source of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/testimony-ensnares-pompeo-in-ukraine-scandal-as-he-mulls-political-future/2019/11/20/f18c3876-0bb8-11ea-a49f-9066f51640f6_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_10">constant speculation</a>,
 the death of U.S. diplomats would be particularly damaging given his 
unyielding criticisms of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton 
following the killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and other American
 personnel in Benghazi in 2012. </p>
<p>But none of those considerations stopped Pompeo from pushing for the 
targeted strike, U.S. officials said, underscoring a fixation on Iran 
that spans 10 years of government service from Congress to the CIA to 
the State Department.</p>
<p>“We took a bad guy off the battlefield. We made the right decision,” 
Pompeo told CNN. “I’m proud of the effort that President Trump 
undertook.”</p>
<p>Pompeo first spoke with Trump about killing Soleimani months ago, 
said a senior U.S. official, but neither the president nor Pentagon 
officials were willing to countenance such an operation.</p>
<p>For more than a year, defense officials warned that the 
administration’s campaign of economic sanctions against Iran had 
increased tensions with Tehran, requiring a bigger and bigger share of 
military resources in the Middle East when many at the Pentagon wanted 
to redeploy their firepower to East Asia.</p>
<p>Trump, too, sought to draw down from the Middle East as he promised 
from the opening days of his presidential campaign. But that mind-set 
shifted on Dec. 27 when 30 rockets hit a joint U.S.-Iraqi base outside 
Kirkuk, killing an American civilian contractor and injuring service 
members.</p>
<p>On Dec. 29, Pompeo, Esper and Milley traveled to the president’s 
private club in Florida, where the two defense officials presented 
possible responses to Iranian aggression, including the option of 
killing Soleimani, senior U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>Trump’s decision to target Soleimani came as a surprise and a shock 
to some officials briefed on his decision, given the Pentagon’s 
long-standing concerns about escalation and the president’s aversion to 
using military force against Iran.</p>
<p>One significant factor was the “lockstep” coordination for the 
operation between Pompeo and Esper, both graduates in the same class at 
the U.S. Military Academy, who deliberated ahead of the briefing with 
Trump, senior U.S. officials said. Pence also endorsed the decision, but
 he did not attend the meeting in Florida.</p>
<p>“Taking out Soleimani would not have happened under [former secretary
 of defense Jim] Mattis,” said a senior administration official who 
argued that the Mattis Pentagon was risk-averse. “Mattis was opposed to 
all of this. It’s not a hit on Mattis, it’s just his predisposition. 
Milley and Esper are different. Now you’ve got a cohesive national 
security team and you’ve got a secretary of state and defense secretary 
who’ve known each other their whole adult lives.”</p>
<p>Mattis declined to comment.</p>
<p>In the days since the strike, Pompeo has become the voice of the 
administration on the matter, speaking to allies and making the public 
case for the operation. Trump chose Pompeo to appear on all of the 
Sunday news shows because he “sticks to the line” and “never gives an 
inch,” an administration official said.</p>
<p>But critics inside and outside the administration have questioned 
Pompeo’s justification for the strike based on his claims that “dozens 
if not hundreds” of American lives were at risk.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"><span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-faces-iran-crisis-with-fewer-experienced-advisers-and-strained-relations-with-traditional-allies/2020/01/05/9b42a240-2f1a-11ea-9b60-817cc18cf173_story.html?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_31">Trump faces Iran crisis with fewer experienced advisers and strained relations with allies</a></span></p>
<p>Lawmakers left classified briefings with U.S. intelligence officials 
on Friday saying they heard nothing to suggest that the threat posed by 
the proxy forces guided by Soleimani had changed substantially in recent
 months.</p>
<p>When repeatedly pressed on Sunday about the imminent nature of the 
threats, whether it was days or weeks away, or whether they had been 
foiled by the U.S. airstrike, Pompeo dismissed the questions.</p>
<p>“If you’re an American in the region, days and weeks — this is not something that’s relevant,” Pompeo told CNN.</p>
<p>Some defense officials said Pompeo’s claims of an imminent and direct
 threat were overstated, and they would prefer that he make the case 
based on the killing of the American contractor and previous Iranian 
provocations.</p>
<p>Critics have also questioned how an imminent attack would be foiled 
by killing Soleimani, who would not have carried out the strike himself.</p>
<p>“If the attack was going to take place when Soleimani was alive, it 
is difficult to comprehend why it wouldn’t take place now that he is 
dead,” said Robert Malley, the president of the International Crisis 
Group and a former Obama administration official.</p>
<p>Following the strike, Pompeo has held back-to-back phone calls with 
his counterparts around the globe but has received a chilly reception 
from European allies, many of whom fear that the attack puts their 
embassies in Iran and Iraq in jeopardy and has now eliminated the chance
 to keep a lid on Iran’s nuclear program.</p>
<p>“We have woken up to a more dangerous world,” said France’s Europe minister, Amelie de Montchalin.</p>
<p>Two European diplomats familiar with the calls said Pompeo expected 
European leaders to champion the U.S. strike publicly even though they 
were never consulted on the decision.</p>
<p>“The U.S. has not helped the Iran situation, and now they want everyone to cheerlead this,” one diplomat said.</p>
<p>“Our position over the past few years has been about defending the 
JCPOA,” said the diplomat, referring to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Iran announced that it was suspending all limits of the 
nuclear deal, including on uranium enrichment, research and development,
 and enlarging its stockpile of nuclear fuel. Britain, France and 
Germany, as well as Russia and China, were original signatories of that 
deal with the United States and Iran, and all opposed Trump’s decision 
to withdraw from the pact.</p>
<p>“No one trusts what Trump will do next, so it’s hard to get behind this,” said the European diplomat.</p>
<p>Pompeo has slapped back at U.S. allies, saying “the Brits, the 
French, the Germans all need to understand that what we did — what the 
Americans did — saved lives in Europe as well,” he told Fox News.</p>
<p>Israel has stood out in emphatically cheering the Soleimani 
operation, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praising Trump
 for “acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively.”</p>
<p>“Israel stands with the United States in its just struggle for peace, security and self-defense,” he said.</p>
<p>Since his time as CIA director, Pompeo has forged a friendship with 
Yossi Cohen, the director of the Israeli intelligence service Mossad, 
said a person familiar with their meetings. The men have spoken about 
the threat posed by Iran to both Israel and the United States. In a 
prescient interview in October, Cohen said Soleimani “knows perfectly 
well that his elimination is not impossible.”</p>
<p>Though Democrats have greeted the strike with skepticism, Republican 
leaders, who have long viewed Pompeo as a reassuring voice in the 
administration, uniformly praised the decision as the eradication of a 
terrorist who directed the killing of U.S. soldiers in Iraq after the 
2003 U.S.-led invasion.</p>
<p>“Soleimani made it his life’s work to take the Iranian revolutionary 
call for death to America and death to Israel and turn them into 
action,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said.</p>
<p>A critical moment for Pompeo is nearing as he faces growing questions
 about a potential Senate run, though some GOP insiders say that 
decision seems to have stalled. Pompeo has kept in touch with Ward 
Baker, a political consultant who would probably lead the operation, and
 others in McConnell’s orbit, about a bid. But Pompeo hasn’t committed 
one way or the other, people familiar with the conversations said.</p>
<p>Some people close to the secretary say he has mixed feelings about 
becoming a relatively junior senator from Kansas after leading the State
 Department and CIA, but there is little doubt in Pompeo’s home state 
that he could win.</p>
<p>At every step of his government career, Pompeo has tried to stake out
 a maximalist position on Iran that has made him popular among two 
critical pro-Israel constituencies in Republican politics: conservative 
Jewish donors and Christian evangelicals.</p>
<p>After Trump tapped Pompeo to lead the CIA, Pompeo quickly set up an 
Iran Mission Center at the agency to focus intelligence-gathering 
efforts and operations, elevating Iran’s importance as an intelligence 
target.</p>
<p>At the State Department, he is a voracious consumer of diplomatic 
notes and reporting on Iran, and he places the country far above other 
geopolitical and economic hot spots in the world.</p>
<p>“If it’s about Iran, he will read it,” said one diplomat, referring 
to the massive flow of paper that crosses Pompeo’s desk. “If it’s not, 
good luck.” </p>
