<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://www.wbtw.com/news/national/">National</a> </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> Posted: Jan 2, 2020 / 10:05 PM EST <span> / </span>Updated: Jan 3, 2020 / 06:11 AM EST </p>
<p>BAGHDAD (AP) Pentagon says the US military has killed Qassem 
Soleimani, head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, at the direction of 
President Trump.</p>
<p>Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, was 
killed in an airstrike at Baghdad’s international airport Friday, Iraqi 
television and three Iraqi officials said.</p>
<p>The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of
 Iran-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF, 
the officials said.</p>
<p>Their deaths are a potential turning point in the Middle East and are
 expected to draw severe retaliation from Iran and the forces it backs 
in the Middle East against Israel and American interests.</p>
<p>The PMF blamed the United States for an attack at Baghdad International Airport Friday.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from the U.S. or Iran.</p>
<p>The Defense Department says Soleimani “was actively developing plans 
to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout 
the region.” </p>
<p>A senior Iraqi politician and a high-level security official 
confirmed to the Associated Press that Soleimani and al-Muhandis were 
among those killed in the attack. Two militia leaders loyal to Iran also
 confirmed the deaths, including an official with the Kataeb Hezbollah, 
which was involved in the attack on the U.S. Embassy this week.</p>
<p>The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said al-Muhandis 
had arrived to the airport in a convoy to receive Soleimani whose plane 
had arrived from either Lebanon or Syria. The airstrike occurred as soon
 as he descended from the plane to be greeted by al-Muhandis and his 
companions, killing them all.</p>
<p>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the 
sensitivity of the subject and because they were not authorized to give 
official statements.</p>
<p>The senior politician said Soleimani’s body was identified by the ring he wore.</p>
<p>Soleimani had been rumored dead several times, including in a 2006 
airplane crash that killed other military officials in northwestern Iran
 and following a 2012 bombing in Damascus that killed top aides of 
embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad. More recently, rumors 
circulated in November 2015 that Soleimani was killed or seriously 
wounded leading forces loyal to Assad as they fought around Syria’s 
Aleppo.</p>
<p>Earlier Friday, an official with an Iran-backed paramilitary force 
said that seven people were killed by a missile fired at Baghdad 
International Airport, blaming the United States.</p>
<p>The official with the group known as the Popular Mobilization Forces 
said the dead included its airport protocol officer, identifying him as 
Mohammed Reda.</p>
<p>A security official confirmed that seven people were killed in the 
attack on the airport, describing it as an airstrike. Earlier, Iraq’s 
Security Media Cell, which releases information regarding Iraqi 
security, said Katyusha rockets landed near the airport’s cargo hall, 
killing several people and setting two cars on fire.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear who fired the missile or rockets or who was targeted. There was no immediate comment from the U.S.</p>
<p>The attack came amid tensions with the United States after a New 
Year’s Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the U.S. Embassy in 
Baghdad. The two-day embassy attack which ended Wednesday prompted 
President Donald Trump to order about 750 U.S. soldiers deployed to the 
Middle East.</p>
<p>The breach at the embassy followed U.S. airstrikes on Sunday that 
killed 25 fighters of the Iran-backed militia in Iraq, the Kataeb 
Hezbollah. The U.S. military said the strikes were in retaliation for 
last week’s killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an 
Iraqi military base that the U.S. blamed on the militia.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have suggested they were prepared to engage in further retaliatory attacks in Iraq.</p>
<p>“The game has changed,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Thursday, 
telling reporters that violent acts by Iran-backed Shiite militias in 
Iraq — including the rocket attack on Dec. 27 that killed one American —
 will be met with U.S. military force.</p>
<p>He said the Iraqi government has fallen short of its obligation to 
defend its American partner in the attack on the U.S. embassy.</p>
<p>The developments also represent a major downturn in Iraq-U.S. 
relations that could further undermine U.S. influence in the region and 
American troops in Iraq and weaken Washington’s hand in its pressure 
campaign against Iran.</p>

 Ky. (AP) — Former Marine pilot Amy McGrath overcame a 
bumpier-than-expected Kentucky primary to win the Democratic U.S. Senate
 nomination Tuesday, fending off progressive Charles Booker to set up a 
bruising, big-spending showdown with Republican Senate Majority Leader 
Mitch McConnell.</p> <p class="rm-manual">Voting ended June 23, but it 
took a week until McGrath could be declared the winner due to the race’s
 tight margins and a deluge of mail-in ballots. The outcome seemed a 
certainty early in the campaign but became tenuous as Booker’s profile 
surged as the Black state lawmaker highlighted protests against the 
deaths of African Americans in encounters with police.</p> <p class="rm-manual"> <span> Read the Full Article </span> </p> <p class="rm-manual"></p> </article> </a> <a href="https://www.wbtw.com/news/national/governor-to-retire-mississippis-confederate-themed-flag/"> <article class="rm-manual"> <p class="rm-manual"> </p><h3 class="rm-manual"> Governor to retire Mississippi’s Confederate-themed flag </h3> by EMILY WAGSTER PETTUS, Associated Press <span>/</span> Jun 30, 2020 <p class="rm-manual">JACKSON,
