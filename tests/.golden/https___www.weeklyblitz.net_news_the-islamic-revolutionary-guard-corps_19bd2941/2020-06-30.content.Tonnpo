<p>Nearly all of Iran’s headline-grabbing provocations in the last few months, from sabotaging and seizing <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=1bed0037b7&amp;e=f2bfb31242">oil tankers</a> to <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=5ee822670f&amp;e=f2bfb31242">drone attacks</a>
 on Saudi pipelines, are the work not of its traditional military 
service branches, but of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).</p>
<p>This shadowy paramilitary institution was established by the late 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini with the constitutional mandate of 
“guarding” the 1979 revolution that gave rise to Iran’s Islamic Republic
 from enemies at home and abroad. It has been extraordinarily effective 
in both stamping out internal dissent and battling external adversaries.</p>
<p class="">Internal</p>
<p>The roughly 125,000-strong IRGC grew out of the protection forces 
that guarded Khomeini and other senior clerics (who distrusted military 
and police bodies inherited from the Shah) in the early days of the 
revolution.</p>
<p>It soon moved on to assassinating opponents of the nascent Islamic 
republic, violently enforcing its strict social codes, and muscling its 
way into every corner of Iranian society. Its volunteer paramilitary 
militia, the Basij (Nirou-ye Moqavemat-e Basij, Mobilization Resistance 
Force), infamous in the West for organizing human wave attacks during 
the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, has millions of members.</p>
<p>The university branch of the Basij, the Student Basij Organization 
(SBO), has played a critical role in monitoring and suppressing 
anti-government dissent among students, as <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=bbeabd3729&amp;e=f2bfb31242">shown</a>
 by Middle East Quarterly author Saeid Golkar, an assistant professor of
 political science at the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga. It was 
instrumental in suppressing the massive nation-wide protests that 
erupted following Iran’s 2009 presidential election.</p>
<p>Unlike Iran’s traditional military and police, the IRGC does not 
answer to elected Iranian leaders and has frequently stirred opposition 
to their policies. But the wishful assumption of many Westerners that 
the IRGC is a “rogue” institution (the antidote to which is invariably 
engagement with elected “moderates”) is false. “The group has seldom 
engaged in activities not sanctioned by the Iranian leadership,” <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=33720dc20f&amp;e=f2bfb31242">concludes</a>
 Middle East Quarterly author Michael Rubin, a resident scholar of the 
American Enterprise Institute. Answering directly, without 
intermediaries, to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, it is the 
purest expression of the Islamic Republic’s authority.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the IRGC is an obedient lapdog or doesn’t have an 
agenda. Elected Iranian leaders – especially President Akbar Hashemi 
Rafsanjani (1989-1997) – found that the easiest way to blunt IRGC 
interference was to lavish state contracts on companies owned by current
 and former IRGC officials. However, as Middle East Quarterlyauthor Ali 
Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East 
Policy <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=5dd157b6f9&amp;e=f2bfb31242">explains</a>,
 in so doing they gave rise to massive IRGC conglomerates that dominate 
the Iranian economy – especially the energy, construction, and 
telecommunications sectors – and “a unified and consolidated elite” 
vested in protecting these interests.</p>
<p>Moreover, former IRGC commanders have risen to the fore of the 
political and cultural spheres in Iran. President Hassan Rouhani’s 
predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and nearly half his cabinet ministers 
were former IRGC officers. Alfonehthen <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=ae69fe4fb6&amp;e=f2bfb31242">warned</a>
 that the IRGC’s growing power could “make Khamenei a prisoner of his 
own Praetorian Guard, paving the way for a military dictatorship.”</p>
<p>However, so long as Khamenei and the IRGC maintain a united public 
front, it’s difficult to determine precisely who is calling the shots. 
The recent succession of unprecedented violent operations against Iran’s
 foreign enemies by the IRGC and its proxies (see below), which began 
two weeks after Khamenei abruptly replaced IRGC commander Mohammad Ali 
Jafari with his more bellicose deputy, General <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=56284033b5&amp;e=f2bfb31242">Hossein Salami</a>, is consistent with either reading of the Iranian power structure.</p>
<p>External</p>
<p>The IRGC’s forty-year war against the Islamic Republic’s foreign 
enemies – spearheaded by its elite Qods Force – is a masterpiece of 
asymmetric warfare.</p>
<p>Early on, the Qods Force proved adept at cultivating regional proxies
 and clients well-suited to the geographic, political, and demographic 
conditions of their host countries. In Lebanon and southern Iraq, home 
to deeply aggrieved minority Shi’a communities, it established 
full-blown revolutionary movements in Khomeini’s image (Hezbollah and 
what’s now known as the Badr Organization, respectively). In <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=c3d0de8db2&amp;e=f2bfb31242">Palestinian areas</a>,
 where there were no Shi’a to waken, the IRGC supported both the Sunni 
Islamist Hamas movement and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a purely military
 organization <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=558f41720b&amp;e=f2bfb31242">characterized</a>
 by MEF Ginsburg/Ingerman Fellow Jonathan Spyer as a “wholly owned 
franchise of the IRGC.” In northern Iraq, where there were few Shi’a but
 conditions were ideal for insurgency, the Qods Force assisted Kurdish 
peshmerga fighting Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Strategically, the IRGC aspired to create a contiguous corridor of 
control from Iranian territory to the Mediterranean. However, 
opportunities for establishing an IRGC presence in most Arab states 
(including Syria, despite the Assad regime’s alliance with Iran) were 
limited prior to 2011 by their relative political stability. Since the 
so-called “Arab Spring,” however, the contraction or collapse of state 
authority in several key countries has made the Qods Force “an 
instrument perfectly suited for the moment that the region is currently 
passing through,” <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=d58f5de501&amp;e=f2bfb31242">writes</a> Spyer, and turned its leader, Maj.-Gen. Qassem Soleimani, into a household name in the Middle East.</p>
<p>In Yemen, the IRGC provided weapons and supplies to Houthi rebels who
 seized the capital in 2015 and have doggedly resisted in the face of 
Saudi-led <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=967e6d290b&amp;e=f2bfb31242">intervention</a>
 on behalf of the internationally recognized government. This success is
 testimony to the IRGC’s “unsurpassed skill in the practice of political
 and paramilitary warfare,” <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=935e28961e&amp;e=f2bfb31242">writes</a> Spyer, and the Saudis having “no parallel ability to use clients.”</p>
<p>Its skill in counterinsurgency has proven to be equally unsurpassed. Spyer <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=ad787ef4bb&amp;e=f2bfb31242">credits</a>
 the IRGC with saving the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. 
Rather than seeking to beef up the country’s uniformed military as per 
the West’s counter-insurgency playbook, the IRGC helped recruit, train, 
and finance a network of indigenous pro-government militias, 
supplemented by thousands of foreign Shi’a fighters.</p>
<p>Research on IRGC-backed groups in Syria by MEF research fellow Aymenn
 Jawad Al-Tamimi, (see sidebar) illustrates the IRGC’s desire to operate
 within the system of an Assad-led Syria, rather than completely 
independent of it (as in Lebanon). Thus, most IRGC-backed groups are on 
the registers of the Local Defense Forces (LDF) and therefore affiliated
 with Syria’s official armed forces.</p>
<p>Though the LDF network is jointly overseen by Syrian military and 
IRGC officers, by 2015, according to Tamimi, Qods Force officers had 
taken over effective <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=e932585121&amp;e=f2bfb31242">command</a>
 of pro-regime assault forces seeking to recapture the Syrian interior. 
With the war in Syria now largely over, the IRGC has continued to expand
 its infrastructure in Syria, incurring periodic Israeli airstrikes.</p>
<p>Roughly the same thing happened in Iraq, where uniformed security 
forces of the Iranian-backed regime buckled before a 2014 ISIS onslaught
 that claimed large swathes of the country. As in Syria, an IRGC-led <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=83f4a3ffc7&amp;e=f2bfb31242">network</a>
 of mostly (but not exclusively) Shi’a militias spearheaded the drive to
 reconquer the country. Iraqi Shi’a militias operating under the direct 
control of the IRGC include the Badr Organization, Ktaeb Hezbollah, 
Asaib Ahl al-Haq, and Hezbollah al-Nujaba. They dominate the 
150,000-strong Popular Mobilization Units (PMU). Under American 
pressure, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi issued a July 2019 
decree mandating the integration of Shi’a militias into the Iraqi 
security forces, but Spyer <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=aafeb6e975&amp;e=f2bfb31242">argues</a> that it’s a sham.</p>
<p>All told, the number of non-Iranian armed combatants in the region who answer to the IRGC has soared to more than 200,000.</p>
<p>In addition, the IRGC has directly orchestrated terrorist operations 
against Israeli/Jewish and American targets overseas, most notably the 
1983 bombings of the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, the 
1992 and 1994 bombings of Jewish targets in Buenos Aires, and the 1996 
Khobar barracks bombing in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The IRGC and its surrogates have “played a lead role attacking Americans,” <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=dedacf3deb&amp;e=f2bfb31242">writes</a>
 Middle East Forum President Daniel Pipes, who estimates that more than 
1,000 U.S. soldiers have lost their lives at the hands of Iranian 
proxies, mostly in Iraq after the U.S.-led ouster of Saddam Hussein in 
2003.</p>
<p>The IRGC’s overseas operatives maintain extensive contact with the 
(mostly Iranian and Lebanese) Shiite diaspora, giving it influence in 
places as far away as <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=fc77c1a3e2&amp;e=f2bfb31242">Africa</a> and <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=5362f48dd6&amp;e=f2bfb31242">Latin America</a>. In Venezuela, <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=c99f7f4ea3&amp;e=f2bfb31242">according</a>
 to MEF Fellow Joseph M. Humire, the motorcycle-riding pro-government 
militias known as colectivos are “clearly modeled on and trained by 
Iran’s paramilitary Basij militia.”</p>
<p>In partnership with the IRGC, Hezbollah has developed a global 
criminal network estimated to earn over a billion dollars annually, 
enabling it to achieve “significant financial autonomy from Iran,” <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=46c3cacbef&amp;e=f2bfb31242">notes</a> MEF Fellow Todd Bensman, and making its operations effectively sanctions-proof.</p>
<p>The IRGC commands a large fleet of fast-attack boats, poised to cut 
off roughly one-third of the world’s seaborne oil supplies that flow 
through the Strait of Hormuz by way of asymmetrical hit-and-run attacks 
on tankers – a tactic the IRGC perfected during the Iran-Iraq war. After
 years of inaction, in May 2019 the IRGC’s “navy” carried out sabotage 
attacks on four commercial ships off the coast of the UAE, followed by 
two more in June. In July, the IRGC changed tactics and <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=dafbc937ee&amp;e=f2bfb31242">seized three tankers</a>.</p>
<p>The IRGC and its proxies control an array of <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=34ad25d374&amp;e=f2bfb31242">ballistic missiles</a>
 capable of hitting targets throughout the region. Last year, the IRGC 
itself twice fired missiles at targets beyond Iran’s borders – seven 
Fateh-110 missiles <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=225a890fd7&amp;e=f2bfb31242">hit</a> the bases of Iranian Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, and a barrage of Zulfiqar and Qiyam missiles <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=bc4318130c&amp;e=f2bfb31242">struck</a>
 one of the last remaining ISIS enclaves in Syria (ostensibly in 
response to an attack on an IRGC parade by Arab separatists in Iran’s 
Khuzestan province weeks earlier).</p>
<p>In addition, the IRGC maintains its own air defense systems, 
particularly in the Gulf region. On June 20, it downed a $130 million 
American RQ-4 Global Hawk drone</p>
<p>The IRGC has a unit specializing in deployment of Iran’s sophisticated arsenal of <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=0c01bdf3a5&amp;e=f2bfb31242">drones</a>.
 In February 2018, an IRGC drone was shot down after entering Israeli 
airspace. In July 2019 the IRGC openly boasted that this unit had <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=9b26773998&amp;e=f2bfb31242">struck</a>
 Kurdish dissidents encamped near its border with Iraq. More 
importantly, it has trained its militia proxies to use drones. On May 
14, 2019, drones launched from southern Iraq <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=d1931ec0bb&amp;e=f2bfb31242">hit</a> Saudi oil installations, an attack initially credited to Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p>
<p>U.S. Policy</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran to 
dismantle its nuclear program put it squarely on a collision course with
 the IRGC. The IRGC thrived under sanctions during the Obama 
administration, which granted waivers allowing substantial Iranian oil 
exports to continue and didn’t fully exert its discretionary power to 
punish violators – in effect, creating an environment where the IRGC’s 
illicit international connections and carte blanche from Khameini gave 
its enterprises an advantage over competitors. No longer.</p>
<p>The breaking point for the IRGC came in April, when the White House announced that it was <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=3e3908c6d9&amp;e=f2bfb31242">designating the IRGC</a>
 as a terrorist organization. In addition to broadening the 
administration’s ability to punish third parties who illicitly trade 
with Iran, the measure was a warning, <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=9b31669f3e&amp;e=f2bfb31242">according</a> to MEF Fellow Seth Frantzman, that Washington “views Iran as responsible for its proxies’ behavior.”</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s reaction to the subsequent wave of IRGC 
violence has been uncharacteristically soporific – largely confined to 
the dispatch of a naval task force to the Persian Gulf to protect 
shipping.</p>
<p>Pipes, who for years has <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=63e3c44b8e&amp;e=f2bfb31242">urged</a>
 that the U.S. “respond to IRGC atrocities with the language of force 
that Iranian leaders only understand,” finds the Trump administration’s 
underwhelming response to the provocations concerning. “Look at what 
they’ve done, and so far no response from the United States,” he said in
 a June 22 <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=94ed90851f&amp;e=f2bfb31242">interview</a>,
 inaction that is sure to embolden IRGC leaders. “If I were in their 
shoes, I’d certainly be feeling quite confident myself.” Trump, he 
added, “should have responded by knocking out some of the Iranian 
nuclear infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Israel appears less inclined to let IRGC outrages go unanswered. It 
has carried out frequent air strikes in Syria on the IRGC and its 
proxies over the course of the civil war, and it appears now that IRGC 
assets in Iraq are no longer safe from Israeli reprisal. In mid-July, a 
senior Al-Qods commander in Iraq was killed in the first of <a href="https://meforum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b7aa7eddb0f2bb74bfa4f6cb5&amp;id=208647e0c0&amp;e=f2bfb31242">four mysterious air strikes</a> in Iraq that the IRGC has blamed on Israel.</p>
