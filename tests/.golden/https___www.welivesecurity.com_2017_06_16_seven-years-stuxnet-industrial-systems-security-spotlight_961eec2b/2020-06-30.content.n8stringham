<p class="rm-manual">Seven years after Stuxnet first came to light, 
industrial systems security once again in the spotlight, reports ESET's 
Robert Lipovsky.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <span> <span> <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/author/lipovsky/" rel="author">Robert Lipovsky</a> 16 Jun 2017 - 03:00PM </span> </span> </p>
<p>Seven years after Stuxnet first came to light, industrial systems 
security once again in the spotlight, reports ESET’s Robert Lipovsky.</p>
<p>June seems to be historically rich in important events relating to the security of industrial systems.</p>
<p>For example, June 17th, 2010, may be considered the day that <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/06/07/infrastructure-attacks-next-generation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stuxnet</a>
 was discovered, the malware behind the very first cyberattack to target
 critical infrastructure, while in June 2014, there were reports of 
attacks against a number of companies using Havex, a remote access 
trojan that collects data from ISC/ SCADA (Industrial Control 
System/Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems.</p>
<p>And, more recently, in June 2017, ESET <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/" rel="noopener noreferrer">published its analysis of Industroyer</a>, another big threat to ICS systems.</p>
<p>Stuxnet: First ever and unequalled in complexity</p>
<p>Stuxnet was a computer worm that was discovered by the Belarus IT security company VirusBlokAda on June 17th 2010 (the day they <a href="http://anti-virus.by/en/tempo.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer">dated</a> their description of the malware – at the time under another name).</p>
<p>This malware had a key part in what is considered the most 
sophisticated cyberattack ever: an operation against the Iranian nuclear
 program. Despite several pitfalls in the attack and a few errors in the
 Stuxnet malware itself, the attack slowed down the process of enriching
 uranium at Natanz (a Iranian nuclear facility) and eventually delayed 
the process of creating nuclear weapons by Iran.</p>
<p>Stuxnet was the first discovered malware targeting industrial systems
 and the first to include a programmable logic controller rootkit – a 
stealth technique used in malware based on falsifying information about 
the presence of the code in order to hide itself. In Stuxnet’s case, it 
was able to camouflage its interference with motor rotational speed from
 monitoring systems.</p>
<p>The Stuxnet attack had several stages. In the first one, Stuxnet, 
itself a computer worm, indiscriminately spread across networks. 
Exploiting four previously unknown – so called zero-day – 
vulnerabilities, it delivered a specialized payload targeting specific 
SCADA systems, which was able to reprogram the devices.</p>
<p>It’s widely known that the Stuxnet operation damaged the centrifuges 
used in the uranium enrichment process by altering their rotor speed. 
Vibrations and distortions caused by large and sudden changes in their 
speed destroyed – according to published estimates – approximately 1,000
 centrifuges. As Iranians were not able to replace them swiftly, they 
ended up producing less enriched uranium than they otherwise would.</p>
<p>Underestimated in the descriptions of the Stuxnet operation is 
another phase of the attack. Before the attackers resorted to altering 
the centrifuges’ speed, they had tried to damage their rotors through 
overpressure.</p>
<p>Gas centrifuges for uranium enrichment are extremely sensitive to 
process pressure. Normally, they operate under a near-vacuum pressure. 
Any increase lowers the enrichment efficiency, with bigger increases 
leading to changes in the process that puts higher mechanical stress on 
the rotor. The attackers leveraged this vulnerability, and the payload 
of this early Stuxnet variant took over control completely.</p>
<p>Acting as a man-in-the-middle, the attackers manipulated the process 
values inside the controller. As a result, the legitimate code runs 
based on fake input values to arrive at desired outcome: the pressure in
 the centrifuges was much higher than it should have been while the 
system reported standard values to its operators.</p>
<p>Why the damage was not as high as the attackers had hoped, making 
them design payload number two – the speed-altering one – is beyond the 
scope of this article. As for why the attackers gradually loosened their
 focus on staying under the radar and eventually let the malware evade 
the targeted environments – maybe we will never know.</p>
<p>Whether or not the Stuxnet operation was successful from a 
geopolitical point of view remains to be fully evaluated (given the fact
 that the details remain hidden in the secret services’ archives, such 
an evaluation must wait until their declassification).</p>
<p>From the cybersecurity point of view, Stuxnet was a breakthrough 
event that should have served as a wake up call for all those involved 
in security of industrial systems. As Ralph Langner wrote in his famous 
paper <a href="https://www.langner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/to-kill-a-centrifuge.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">To Kill a Centrifuge</a>:
 “While the attack was highly specific, attack tactics and technology 
are not; they are generic and can be used against other targets as 
well”.</p>
<p>Four years after Stuxnet: The Havex intelligence-gathering attacks</p>
<p>In June 2014, another malware designed to attack industrial systems <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/havex-malware-strikes-industrial-sector-via-watering-hole-attacks/article/538721/" rel="noopener noreferrer">was detected</a>
 as attacking a number of companies in Europe. Manufacturers of 
industrial applications and machines in Europe and USA were targeted by 
Havex, a remote access trojan that collects data from ISC/SCADA systems.</p>
<p>The attack, which can be labeled as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_hole_attack" rel="noopener noreferrer">watering hole attack</a>,
 was apparently an attempt to harvest intelligence needed for further 
attacks on infrastructures built using hardware by the targeted 
manufacturers.</p>
<p>While no such subsequent attack was detected, the 2014 Havex attack 
reminds us that cybercriminals – whether state-sponsored (as apparently 
in the case of Stuxnet) or financially motivated – have tools and 
information available to attack industrial systems.</p>
<p>Seven years after Stuxnet: Power shut down by malware </p>
<p>On June 12th, 2017, ESET <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/" rel="noopener noreferrer">published its analysis of Industroyer</a>, the biggest threat to industrial control systems since Stuxnet.</p>
<p>Industroyer was most probably the malware that shut down the power 
grid in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, in December 2016. More importantly, 
Industroyer is the first ever malware capable of attacking power grids 
automatically (in comparison to BlackEnergy, which was also used to 
attack the Ukrainian power grid but the actual power outage had to be 
executed manually). With minor adjustments, it is capable of doing 
significant harm to electric power systems in the EMEA region and 
potentially in other parts of the world, including the USA. It could 
also be refitted to target other types of critical infrastructure like 
water or gas utilities or transportation control systems.</p>
<p>Industrial systems need protection</p>
<p>A full understanding of the Stuxnet-introduced methods (see our comprehensive whitepaper <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/media_files/white-papers/Stuxnet_Under_the_Microscope.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stuxnet under the Microscrope</a>
 for more details) is necessary for assessing the risks industrial 
systems are faced with. Their underlying technologies were not meant to 
be connected to the internet and were designed without appropriate 
security in mind.</p>
<p>Also, mitigation strategies that might work well in IT security – air
 gaps, anti-malware technologies or security patches – are a lot more 
difficult to deploy in these types of environments.</p>
<p class="">All that leaves us with a worrisome conclusion: the 
sophistication of these ICS-targeting threats combined with the skill 
level of their authors and/or operators stands in great contrast with 
the (in)security level of some areas of ICS infrastructure.</p>
