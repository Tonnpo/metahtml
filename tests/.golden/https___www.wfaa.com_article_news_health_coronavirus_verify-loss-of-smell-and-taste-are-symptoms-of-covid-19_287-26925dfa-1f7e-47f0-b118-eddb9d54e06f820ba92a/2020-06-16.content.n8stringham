<p>DALLAS — According to the Centers for Disease Control, there are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsymptoms.html">three symptoms</a>
 of COVID19: fever, cough and shortness of breath. But we’ve been 
hearing a lot about loss of sense of smell and taste. Should those be 
recognized symptoms too?</p>
<p>The anecdotal evidence and a growing body of research suggests there 
is a correlation but scientifically, the answer has not yet been proven.
 However, now there's a new study that aims to answer the question.</p>
<p>It's from <a href="https://www.entnet.org/content/reporting-tool-patients-anosmia-related-covid-19">American Academy of Otolaryngology</a> or Ear, Nose and Throat doctors. <a href="https://www.entnet.org/content/Next_EVP_CEO_Named">Dr. James C. Denneny</a> is the CEO of the Academy. The study will be published Wednesday and Dr. Denneny told WFAA about the findings.</p>
<p>“Can a loss of sense of smell and taste be a symptom of COVID-19?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I believe the evidence is quite clear that is true,” he said.</p>
<p>And here's the evidence. </p>
<p>The Academy has collected data from 237 patients who reported a loss 
of smell and later tested positive for COVID-19. It found 70% of them 
reported loss of smell as one of their symptoms before their diagnosis. 
For 25%, it was their only early symptom.</p>
<p>“So, if that turns out to follow a pattern, it may well be that this 
is kind of a red flag or trigger that even though they don't have the 
other major symptoms, these progressed on to get the COVID19 virus 
positive,” Dr. Denneny said.</p>
<p>These new findings are consistent with other studies around the world, including one from <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2020/03/119_286790.html">South Korea</a> that found 15% of patients lost their sense of smell or taste. Another in <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/loss-smell-could-reveal-hidden-virus-cases-experts-111224454.html">Germany</a> found loss of smell to be common among 100 patients that were interviewed.</p>
<p>In England, their academy of <a href="https://www.entuk.org/sites/default/files/files/ENTUK%20_%20BRS%20update%20-%20Anosmia%20as%20a%20potential%20marker%20of%20COVID-19%20infection.pdf">ENT</a>
 doctors say patients who've lost a sense of smell "should be considered
 likely to have COVID-19 infection. Patients should be advised to 
self-isolate."</p>
<p>“I would say this, in addition to several of the others I mentioned, 
the preponderance of these studies together, this confirms that and has a
 little more detail then some of the others,” Denneny said.</p>
<p>So, should a loss of sense of smell and taste symptoms be recognized 
symptoms of COVID-19? Officially, that has not happened. But the 
evidence suggests they are symptoms and it’s critical that people have 
them, take appropriate action.</p>
