<h3><span>Quote</span></h3>
<p>It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction.</p>
<p> President Donald J. Trump </p>
<p>President Donald J. Trump, in consultation with his national security
 team, has approved a new strategy for Iran. It is the culmination of 
nine months of deliberation with Congress and our allies on how to best 
protect American security.</p>
<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<p>Core Elements of the President’s New Iran Strategy</p>
<ul> <li>The United States’ new Iran strategy focuses on neutralizing 
the Government of Iran’s destabilizing influence and constraining its 
aggression, particularly its support for terrorism and militants.</li> <li>We
 will revitalize our traditional alliances and regional partnerships as 
bulwarks against Iranian subversion and restore a more stable balance of
 power in the region.</li> <li>We will work to deny the Iranian regime –
 and especially the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – funding 
for its malign activities, and oppose IRGC activities that extort the 
wealth of the Iranian people.</li> <li>We will counter threats to the United States and our allies from ballistic missiles and other asymmetric weapons.</li> <li>We
 will rally the international community to condemn the IRGC’s gross 
violations of human rights and its unjust detention of American citizens
 and other foreigners on specious charges.</li> <li>Most importantly, we will deny the Iranian regime all paths to a nuclear weapon.</li> </ul>
<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
<p>The Nature of the Iranian Regime under Supreme Leader Khamenei</p>
<ul> <li>For 28 years, Ali Khamenei has been Iran’s Supreme Leader. 
Before that, he held the office of President for 8 years. In that time, 
he has shaped the Iranian regime in his image.</li> <li>Khamenei and the
 IRGC have pursued a steady policy of spreading a revolutionary ideology
 aimed at undermining the international system and many states by force 
and subversion. His main enemy and rallying point has been and continues
 to be the United States of America, which he calls the Great Satan.</li> <li>Under
 Khamenei, Iran exports violence, destabilizes its neighbors, and 
sponsors terrorism abroad. Within Iran, under Khamenei’s rule the 
Iranian government has oppressed its people, abusing their rights, 
restricting their access to the internet and the outside world, rigging 
elections, shooting student protesters in the street, and imprisoning 
political reformers like Mir Hussein Musavi and Mehdi Karroubi.</li> </ul>
<p>The Threats from the Iranian Regime</p>
<ul> <li>The reckless behavior of the Iranian regime, and the IRGC in 
particular, poses one of the most dangerous threats to the interests of 
the United States and to regional stability.</li> <li>The Iranian regime
 has taken advantage of regional conflicts and instability to 
aggressively expand its regional influence and threaten its neighbors 
with little domestic or international cost for its actions.</li> <li>This
 occurred most recently following the emergence of the Islamic State of 
Iraq and Syria (ISIS) from the vacuum created by the Obama 
administration’s ill-considered withdrawal from the region.</li> <li>The full range of the Iranian regime’s malign activities extends well beyond the nuclear threat it poses, including: <ul> <li>Ballistic missile development and proliferation;</li> <li>Material and financial support for terrorism and extremism;</li> <li>Support for the Assad regime’s atrocities against the Syrian people;</li> <li>Unrelenting hostility to Israel;</li> <li>Consistently threatening freedom of navigation, especially in the strategically vital Persian Gulf;</li> <li>Cyber-attacks against the United States, Israel, and America’s other allies and partners in the Middle East;</li> <li>Grievous human rights abuses; and</li> <li>Arbitrary detention of foreigners, including United States citizens, on specious charges and without due process.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<p>The Need for a Comprehensive Strategy</p>
<ul> <li>The previous Administration’s myopic focus on Iran’s nuclear 
program to the exclusion of the regime’s many other malign activities 
allowed Iran’s influence in the region to reach a high-water mark.</li> <li>Over
 the last decade and a half, United States policy has also consistently 
prioritized the immediate threat of Sunni extremist organizations over 
the longer-term threat of Iranian-backed militancy.</li> <li>In doing 
so, the United States has neglected Iran’s steady expansion of proxy 
forces and terrorist networks aimed at keeping its neighbors weak and 
unstable in hopes of dominating the greater Middle East. Recently, the 
Iranian regime has accelerated the seeding of these networks with 
increasingly destructive weapons as they try to establish a bridge from 
Iran to Lebanon and Syria.</li> <li>The Trump Administration will not repeat these mistakes.</li> <li>The
 Trump Administration’s Iran policy will address the totality of these 
threats from and malign activities by the Government of Iran and will 
seek to bring about a change in the Iranian’s regime’s behavior.</li> <li>The
 Trump Administration will accomplish these objectives through a 
strategy that neutralizes and counters Iranian threats, particularly 
those posed by the IRGC.</li> </ul>
<p>Countering the IRGC</p>
<ul> <li>Supreme Leader Khamenei’s primary tool and weapon in remaking 
Iran into a rogue state has been the hardline elements of the IRGC.</li> <li>The
 IRGC’s stated purpose is to subvert the international order. The IRGC’s
 power and influence have grown over time, even as it has remained 
unaccountable to the Iranian people, answering only to Khamenei. It is 
hard to find a conflict or a suffering people in the Middle East that 
the IRGC’s tentacles do not touch.</li> <li>Unaccountable to Iran’s 
elected leaders or its people, the IRGC has tried to gain control over 
large portions of Iran’s economy and choke off competition, all the 
while working to weaken and undermine Iran’s neighbors and perpetuate 
the chaos and instability in which it thrives.</li> <li>The IRGC has 
armed Bashar al Assad and guided his butchering of his own people in 
Syria and has cynically condoned his use of chemical weapons.</li> <li>The IRGC has sought to undermine the fight against ISIS with the influence of militant groups in Iraq under the IRGC’s control.</li> <li>In
 Yemen, the IRGC has attempted to use the Houthis as puppets to hide 
Iran’s role in using sophisticated missiles and explosive boats to 
attack innocent civilians in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, 
as well as to restrict freedom of navigation in the Red Sea.</li> <li>The
 IRGC has even threatened terrorist attacks right here at home. Senior 
IRGC commanders plotted the murder of Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to the 
United States, Adel Jubeir, on American soil in 2011. But for 
exceptional work by our law enforcement and intelligence officers to 
detect and disrupt this egregious act, the IRGC would have conducted 
this terrorist attack and assassination in our own capital and would 
have killed not only a Saudi Arabian diplomat, but a host of other 
innocent bystanders at a popular restaurant in Washington, D.C.</li> <li>The
 IRGC, which repeatedly displays reckless hostility and disregard for 
the laws and norms that underpin the international order, threatens all 
nations and the global economy.</li> <li>Our partners in the 
international community agree with us that the IRGC’s reckless behavior 
threatens international peace and security. They agree that the IRGC is 
fanning sectarianism and perpetuating regional conflict. They agree that
 the IRGC is engaged in corrupt economic practices that exploit the 
Iranian people and suppress internal dissent, human rights, and Iran’s 
economic prosperity.</li> <li>For all these reasons, we want to work 
with our partners to constrain this dangerous organization, for the 
benefit of international peace and security, regional stability, and the
 Iranian people.</li> </ul>
<p>The Iranian Nuclear Program and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action</p>
<ul> <li>The Iranian regime’s activities severely undercut whatever 
positive contributions to “regional and international peace and 
security” the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) sought to 
achieve.</li> <li>Even with regard to JCPOA itself, the Iranian regime 
has displayed a disturbing pattern of behavior, seeking to exploit 
loopholes and test the international community’s resolve.</li> <li>Iranian
 military leaders have stated publicly that they will refuse to allow 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections of their military 
sites. These statements fly in the face of Iran’s commitments under 
JCPOA and the Additional Protocol. Not long ago these same organizations
 hid nuclear facilities on military sites.</li> <li>This behavior cannot
 be tolerated; the deal must be strictly enforced, and the IAEA must 
fully utilize its inspection authorities.</li> </ul></article>
