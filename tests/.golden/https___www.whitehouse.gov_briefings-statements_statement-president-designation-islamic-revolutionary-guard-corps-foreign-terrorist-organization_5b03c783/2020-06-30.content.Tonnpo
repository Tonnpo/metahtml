<p>Today, I am formally announcing my Administration’s plan to designate
 Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including its Qods 
Force, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under Section 219 of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act. This unprecedented step, led by the
 Department of State, recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a 
State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, 
finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft. The IRGC is 
the Iranian government’s primary means of directing and implementing its
 global terrorist campaign.</p>
<p>This designation will be the first time that the United States has 
ever named a part of another government as a FTO. It underscores the 
fact that Iran’s actions are fundamentally different from those of other
 governments. This action will significantly expand the scope and scale 
of our maximum pressure on the Iranian regime. It makes crystal clear 
the risks of conducting business with, or providing support to, the 
IRGC. If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling 
terrorism.</p>
<p>This action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for 
terrorism has serious consequences. We will continue to increase 
financial pressure and raise the costs on the Iranian regime for its 
support of terrorist activity until it abandons its malign and outlaw 
behavior.</p></article>
