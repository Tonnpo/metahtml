<p class="rm-manual">By <a href="file:///contributor/benjamin-elisha-sawe">Benjamin Elisha Sawe</a> on June 18 2019 in <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/society/">Society</a></p>
<figcaption>Ayatollah Khomeini on an Iranian banknote. </figcaption><p>In
 the late 1970s, the Pahlavi Dynasty was overthrown and replaced by a 
new Islamic Republic of Iran. The revolution was mostly non-violent, 
although there were incidents of armed struggle. Here is an overview of 
the events that led up to the Iranian revolution, as well as the events 
in the revolution and the aftermath. </p>
<h2>Before the Revolution</h2>
<h3>Western and Secular Influences on Iranian Society Before the Revolution</h3>
<p>Prior to the revolution, <a href="file:///webimage/countrys/asia/ir.htm">Iran</a>
 was ruled by a monarchy headed by Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. The Shah 
was heavily US-backed and promoted westernization which many Iranians 
believed was diluting their indigenous culture and values. Separation of
 sexes, which had been a traditional practice, had been banned. Women 
during this period wore western clothes in place of the hijab and could 
now go to school, vote, and work. The new rights to women were embraced 
by the elite society while Islam Puritans viewed it as secularization. A
 more secular take on religion was adopted, where religious minorities 
could hold office.</p>
<h3>Discontent With the Pahlavi Dynasty</h3>
<p>Due to the Shah’s economic reforms, Iran had ascended into the ranks 
as a globally formidable industrial economy. By late 1970s, the economy 
had stagnated, and <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-does-inflation-work.html" rel="noopener">inflation</a>
 led to a higher cost of living. Iranians all over the country were 
dissatisfied with the regime and viewed it as having failed on its 
economic promise coupled with corruption and incompetence among public 
officials.</p>
<p>The regime of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi was very oppressive, and 
used the SAVAK, who were the American-trained secret police, for mass 
murder, torture, and imprisonment of those against his government. The 
Shah’s ideology that westernization was the tool for Iran’s progress was
 seen as having failed, and the Iranians felt that they should turn back
 to Islam.</p>
<h3>Student, Left-wing, and Conservative Shia Sentiments Against the Shah's Government</h3>
<p>The government was heavily opposed by the Conservative Shia Muslims 
led by Ayatollah Khomeini. The basis of their arguments against the 
government took a cultural and religious approach. The Conservative Shia
 accused the Shah of destroying Islam through the popularization of 
Western values.</p>
<p>Iranian Muslim Students, who had been exposed to the ideas of 
Ayatollah Khomeini, increasingly began to support the idea of an Islamic
 State. The left-wing Islamist groups encouraged the use of armed 
struggle as the means to topple the Shah’s regime.</p>
<h3>Setting the Revolution into Motion</h3>
<p>The early 1970s brought with it inflation in Iran’s economy, and the 
Shah was criticized for his extravagance while most Iranians were 
suffering in poverty. The Shah’s government suppressed any form of 
resistance and had exiled Ayatollah Khomeini. By the start of 1977 
however, Khomeini ideologies began to spread in Iran through smuggled 
audio cassettes. Khomeini called for strikes, refusal to pay tax, 
boycotts, and even martyrdom for the Islam religion. The death of 
Khomeini’s son in 1977, which was blamed on the SAVAK, increased 
Khomeini’s popularization. Organizations opposed to the government also 
cropped up in Iran which encouraged open resistance.</p>
<h2>During the Revolution</h2>
<h3>Major Events</h3>
<p>Demonstrations began in January of 1978 with religious students who 
were protesting a slanderous article with criticism against Khomeini 
published by a Tehran newspaper. Many students were killed by the 
government which sparked off nationwide protests concentrated in 
religious institutions. Protests surged after the 40 day customary 
mourning period in Shi’ite customs for the students. Institutions viewed
 as western such as cinemas and bars were razed to the ground. Deaths 
during protests served to fuel more demonstrations. The Shah attempted 
to institute reforms to quell down the protests, but he eventually fled 
Iran on January 16, 1979. Khomeini returned to Iran in February in 1979.</p>
<h2>After the Revolution</h2>
<h3>Outcomes</h3>
<p>A referendum was held in April of 1979, and Iranians voted 
overwhelmingly to establish an Islamic Republic. A new constitution was 
adopted, and Ayatollah Khomeini became the Supreme Leader of the 
Republic of Iran.</p>
<h3>Global Versus Internal Perceptions of the Revolution</h3>
<p>The Iranian Revolution shocked the world as it was not caused by 
economic issues, but rather cultural reform. The Economic crisis had 
been, up to that point, the leading cause of revolutions and Iran had 
been enjoying relative economic prosperity. Iranians viewed the 
revolution as the only way to block western influence in their country.</p>
<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>A conservative rule in Iran was enforced, and former nationalists, 
elites, and left-wing revolutionaries were sidelined in the new regime. 
Strict dress codes were implemented and rigorously enforced. <a href="file:///webimage/countrys/asia/iq.htm">Iraq</a>
 felt threatened by Iran and, to avoid the possibility of a Shia 
revolution in Iraq, the country invaded Iran in 1980, a war that lasted 
for eight years. The war served to unite Iranians against the 
US-supported Iraq forces.</p>
<h3>Geopolitical Outlook of Iran Following the Revolution and Today</h3>
<p>The reign of Khomeini as Supreme spiritual leader ended in 1989 with 
his death, and he was succeeded by Hojatoleslam Seyed Ali Khamenei, who 
had been president since August of 1981. Khamenei led the wave of 
revolutionary purists who firmly believed in non-compromising on 
revolutionary ideals. The Revolutionary Guards in Iran have risen in 
status to be a political and economic force. Sanctions placed on Iran by
 the US increasingly isolated Iran, a situation which can still be seen 
today. While Iran’s economy remains largely reliant on oil, many 
Iranians are dissatisfied with the perceived inflation and corruption in
 the government. Iran remains an Islamic state to this day.</p>
