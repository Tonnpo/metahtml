<p class="rm-manual">EDITOR'S NOTE: On Feb. 1, 1979, Iran's exiled 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini descended from a chartered Air France Boeing
 747 to return to Tehran, a moment that changed the country's history 
for decades to come.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Confrontations between security forces and 
demonstrators raged on even after Khomeini's arrival, which followed the
 departure of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The U.S.-allied shah, fatally 
stricken with cancer, would never return and the caretaker government he
 left behind would soon fall to Khomeini's Islamic Revolution.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">That revolution would spark the U.S. Embassy 
takeover and hostage crisis, stoking the animosity that exists between 
Tehran and Washington to this day.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Now, 40 years later, The Associated Press is making
 its story and historic photographs of Khomeini's arrival to Iran 
available. The story has been edited for typographical errors, but 
maintains the AP style of the day, such as using "Moslem" as opposed to 
Muslim.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">TEHRAN, Iran — Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned
 home Thursday after more than 4 years of exile to pursue his dream of 
replacing Iran's 2,500-year-old monarchy with an Islamic republic.</p>
<p>As the chartered Air France jetliner landed with the bearded, 
78-year-old religious leader of the revolution against Shah Mohammad 
Reza Pahlavi, a million excited followers lined the 1 mile route he was 
to take from the airport to Tehran's largest cemetery where he was to 
speak.</p>
<p>Six tanks guarded the entrance to the airport, and the crowd made no 
attempt to get on to the field. But the army was keeping a low profile, 
leaving the policing of the airport to the normal security force there, 
while 50,000 "Islamic police" designated by the welcoming committee 
maintained order along the route to the cemetery.</p>
<p>Khomeini's Boeing jumbo jet landed on schedule at 9 a.m. (12:30 a.m. 
EST) but 40 minutes passed before the Shiite Moslem patriarch made his 
appearance at the door of the plane.</p>
<p>When he did, white capped military policemen rushed forward and shoed
 back photographers and a small group of well-wishers waiting at the 
bottom of the steps.</p>
<p>The white bearded old man descended the ramp slowly, assisted by an 
aide and an Air France steward. He was escorted to a waiting Mercedes 
limousine which took him to the newly refurnished terminal building 
where a selected group of . faithful followers waited.</p>
<p>The scene at the terminal was chaotic.</p>
<p>Khomeini was held up for a time by a crush of 300 mullahs Moslem 
priests, reporters and others who blocked the entrance, shoving and 
pushing.</p>
<p>One mullah tried to climb over the backs of reporters to see the 
ayatollah. Other mullahs appealed for calm over the terminal's 
loudspeakers, ordered the crowd to sit down and started chanting from 
the Koran, the Moslem holy book, to try to quiet the crowd.</p>
<p>When Khomeini finally was able to enter the reception area, it echoed
 with cries of "Allah is Great" and "Khomeini is our imam," a Moslem 
title meaning "divinely inspired leader."</p>
<p>Speaking in a loud, firm voice, the Ayatollah told his supporters: "We are succeeding, but this is only the first stage."</p>
<p>"Our culture has been despotism and colonialism," he declared, 
attacking the shah's regime. "Everything we had has been thrown to the 
wind. . He the shah, has made the army follow the orders of another 
country," an apparent reference to the United States.</p>
<p>Khomeini said the movement he inspired will be successful only "when the roots of colonialism are pulled out."</p>
<p>He accused forces he did not identify of trying to restore the shah 
to absolute power but asserted: "The imperialist shah regime is all in 
the past and cannot be brought back again."</p>
<p>"Our success," he said, "is the result of the unity of all the people
 in this country. They all follow one word Islam and even the religious 
minorities are united with Islam."</p>
<p>Among those in the reception hall were representatives of the 
Armenian and Assyrian Christian churches as well as Karim Sanjaby, the 
leader of the political opposition to the shah, the National Front.</p>
<p>Shouts of "Allah Akhbar" — God Is Great — rang out as the ayatollah 
finished his statement. The crowd (surged) forward, and aides shielded 
Khomeini, who was backed up against a stair railing until Moslem 
marshals shoed the crowd back.</p>
<p>At a news conference during the flight from Paris, aides of Khomeini 
said he probably would announce his own provisional government for Iran 
in the next few days. They said the nationwide strikes called by the 
ayatollah would be terminated after Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar and
 his government agreed to resign and make way for an Islamic republic.</p>
<p>In advance of Khomeini's arrival, leaders of the armed forces paraded
 tanks and troops through Tehran Wednesday to show that the decision to 
allow him to return did not signal surrender by the Bakhtiar government.</p>
<p>Bakhtiar in a radio-television broadcast Wednesday night declared: 
"The government will not permit the reins of the country to be held by 
anyone except the central government." He said Iran was in a "very 
critical and dangerous period" and the government would "resist chaos 
and doubtful elements."</p>
<p>Khomeini issued a brief statement before leaving Paris, thanking the 
French government and saying, "I leave your country to go and serve my 
country."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Khomeini conceded that, after reports reached Paris 
of troops taking up new positions near Tehran's Mehrabad airport, some 
followers urged him to postpone his return.</p>
<p>"But the ayatollah has made his decision and that is it," spokesman, Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, told reporters in Paris.</p></article>
