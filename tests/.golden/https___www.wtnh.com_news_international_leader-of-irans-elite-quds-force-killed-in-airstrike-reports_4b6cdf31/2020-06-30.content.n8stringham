<p>BAGHDAD, Iraq (ABC News) ‚Äî Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran‚Äôs 
elite Quds Force, was killed late Thursday in an airstrike that targeted
 a convoy near the airport in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis also died in the 
airstrike, Ahmed al-Assadi, a spokesman for Iraq‚Äôs Popular Mobilization 
Forces umbrella grouping of Iran-backed militias, confirmed to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/leader-irans-elite-quds-force-killed-airstrike-reports/story?id=68039918">ABC News</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe proud commander of Islam, Haj Qassim Suleimani, was killed in 
the attack on American helicopters today after a long day of mourning,‚Äù 
the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense took responsibility, saying the airstrike was carried out at the direction of President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The following statement was issued Thursday night:</p>
<p> At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken 
decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing 
Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds 
Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. </p>
<p>General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American 
diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General
 Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of 
hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of 
thousands more. He had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq 
over the last several months ‚Äì including the attack on December 27th ‚Äì 
culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi 
personnel. General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. 
Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week. </p>
<p> This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. The 
United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our 
people and our interests wherever they are around the world. </p>
<p>Following the strike, the U.S. State Department issued an alert early
 Friday morning urging U.S. citizens to leave Iraq and to avoid the U.S.
 embassy in Baghdad. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúDue to heightened tensions in Iraq and the region, we urge U.S. 
citizens to depart Iraq immediately,‚Äù the alert said. ‚ÄúDue to 
Iranian-backed militia attacks at the U.S. Embassy compound, all 
consular operations are suspended. U.S. citizens should not approach the
 Embassy.‚Äù </p>
<p> Soleimani and the Quds Force ‚Äúwere responsible for the deaths of 
hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of 
thousands more,‚Äù said the Department of Defense statement explaining the
 strike. ‚ÄúHe had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over 
the last several months ‚Äî including the attack on December 27th ‚Äî 
culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi 
personnel.‚Äù </p>
<p> One U.S. civilian contractor was killed and several service members 
were wounded in the Dec. 27 rocket attack on the K1 military base used 
by U.S. and coalition forces in northern Iraq. The attack led to 
retaliatory U.S. military strikes in Iraq and Syria Sunday against the 
Iranian-backed militia the U.S. blamed for the Dec. 27 attack, which in 
turn led hundreds of pro-Iranian protesters to attempt to storm the U.S.
 embassy in Baghdad on New Year‚Äôs Eve. </p>
<p>Thursday‚Äôs strike against Soleimani ‚Äúwas aimed at deterring future 
Iranian attack plans,‚Äù the U.S. statement continued. ‚ÄúThe United States 
will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our
 interests wherever they are around the world.‚Äù </p>
<p>Trump tweeted an American flag after the strike. It went viral within seconds.</p>

<p>On Friday morning, he Tweeted, ‚ÄúIran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!‚Äù</p>

<p>Connecticut leaders quickly criticized and questioned the decision.</p>
<p>Senator Chris Murphy reacted to the news on Twitter, saying: 
‚ÄúSoleimani was an enemy of the United States. That‚Äôs not a question. The
 question is this ‚Äì as reports suggest, did America just assassinate, 
without any congressional authorization, the second most powerful person
 in Iran, knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war?‚Äù</p>

<p>Senator Murphy also released a statement Friday morning saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo matter how good it may feel that Qasem Soleimani is no longer 
alive, he likely will end up being more dangerous to the United States, 
our troops, and our allies, as a martyr than as a living, breathing 
military adversary. There will be reprisals, and Iran will likely target
 American troops and even our own political and military leaders. This 
is why the United States does not assassinate leaders of foreign 
nations-in the end such action risks getting more, not less, Americans 
killed in the long run.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs disastrous approach to Iran has, from the 
beginning, been all tactics and no strategy. They make it up day by day.
 The assassination of Soleimani fits this pattern. I hope I am wrong, 
but I suspect this White House is totally unprepared for the cascade of 
consequences that will follow last night‚Äôs actions. I pray for the 
Americans who, today, are in harm‚Äôs way. </p>
<p>‚ÄúNow, it is up to Congress to press the president to disclose his 
legal basis for this action and the plan for how our nation manages the 
fallout. I doubt there is congressional authority for this strike, and I
 doubt the president has a plan for what comes next. But these are 
questions Congress must now ask.‚Äù</p>
<p>Senator Richard Blumenthal also questioned the action‚Äôs consequences of a possible war.</p>
<p>Trump Admin owes a full explanation of airstrike reports‚Äîall the 
facts‚Äîto Congress&amp;the American people. The present authorizations 
for use of military force in no way cover starting a possible new war. 
This step could bring the most consequential military confrontation in 
decades</p>

<p>Congressman Joe Courtney (CT-02) released a statement Friday morning saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe unilateral decision by President Trump to strike down a bad 
actor such as Soleimani unfortunately does not close the book on the 
threat Iran poses to America. Not consulting with the American people, 
Congressional leadership and our allies before taking this escalatory 
action in a part of the world where we have been entangled for eighteen 
long years is the wrong way to isolate Iranian bad behavior and wind 
down our involvement in the Middle East.‚Äù</p>
