<p class="rm-manual">2 months ago</p>
<p>PM Modi's message was clear - COVID-19 pandemic can hit any country 
and the need is to contain the spread at this juncture. The bold 
measures taken to control the outbreak from closing borders to all 
international commercial flights to Janata curfew and work from home for
 all non-essential sectors all point towards this.</p>
<p>PM also addressed why we need to do this referring to the growth 
curve of coronavirus in worst-hit countries. "In these countries, after 
the initial few days, a sudden explosion of the disease has occurred. In
 these countries, the number of people infected with coronavirus has 
increased very rapidly. The Government of India is keeping a close watch
 on this track record of the spread of coronavirus."</p>
<p>That indicates the underlying emergency and the need to contain the 
spread of the coronavirus. Rightly so with the fast progression in the 
number of confirmed cases.</p>
<p>With 200 reported confirmed cases as per the Indian Health Ministry 
website, it appears that India still has been largely untouched by the 
virus.</p>
<p>The number of COVID-19 positive cases in India however have been doubling in 5-6 days.</p>
<p> Here is how India compares to the rest of the world on number of confirmed cases:</p>
<p>Source: Ourworldindata (up to March 19th) </p>
<p>The global figures also show with appropriate containment and 
mitigation strategies countries like South Korea have been able to slow 
down the growth in number of confirmed cases. PM Modi indicated towards 
that in his speech too.</p>
<p>Italy, which was reportedly slow in arresting the spread of 
coronavirus in initial days of the outbreak, saw the variety of 
confirmed instances go up from 322 to over 10,000 in two weeks.</p>
<p> India TrendsIndia saw its first major jump in confirmed cases on 
March 3-4th when the numbers went up five-fold. From 5 confirmed cases 
to 27.</p>
<p>The second surge wave in confirmed cases was between March 9th and 14th where the numbers almost doubled.</p>
<p>The last 6 days have been even critical, where we have seen the 
confirmed cases rise more than double. From 84 recorded on March 14th to
 151 on March 18th the numbers almost doubled.</p>
<p>However, in last 36 hours there has been a 30 percent jump. </p>
<p>Source: worldometer </p>
<p>Latest data from Worldometer puts India's current figures at 197 confirmed cases (as of 6pm on March 19th).</p>
<p>State wise figures see wide variations.</p>
<p>Maharashtra has seen the fastest additions in number of confirmed 
cases in the last 6 days. Number of reported confirmed cases has gone up
 3.5 times in the last 5 days, from 14 on 13th March to 49 on 19th March
 (as of 6pm). Just between yesterday and today the numbers have shot up 
by 20 percent. </p>
<p>COVID-19 has now affected at least 20 states and union territories in
 India. Fresh cases have been confirmed in Maharashtra, Karnataka, 
Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh and Gujarat.</p>
<p>Kerala with 27 cases (incl 2 foreigners) </p>
<p>Uttar Pradesh with 19</p>
<p>Karnataka with 17</p>
<p>Telangana wit 13 (incl foreigners)</p>
<p>And Delhi with 11 cases have been the states seeing a larger burden.</p>
<p>India on Thursday reported its fourth death due to COVID-19. A 
70-year-old diabetic patient from Punjab, with a travel history to 
Germany and Italy, succumbed to the virus.</p>
<p>With this India's death rate due to COVID-19 is around 2, lower than the <a href="https://www.wuhanupdate.com/rates/reported-case-fatality-rates-0682066">reported case fatality rates</a> of 3.4% globally (WHO data). However, the fatality rates vary from country to country.</p>
<p>The positives in the India story is the recovery rate that stands at 10%. </p>
<p>However currently there is no data available on how many patients are
 serious or critical, requiring ICU or ventilatory support in India. But
 if we go by the world data only about 5%, roughly 7,000 are those in 
critical conditions.</p>
<p>While serious questions have been raised on under-reported numbers 
and the lack of enough testing, Health Ministry's reiteration that 
"there is no question of community transmission as of now in India" 
provides some solace.</p>
<p>High time the country takes the PM's message of be prepared, stay 
home and do your bit, seriously to help keep the numbers under control.</p>
