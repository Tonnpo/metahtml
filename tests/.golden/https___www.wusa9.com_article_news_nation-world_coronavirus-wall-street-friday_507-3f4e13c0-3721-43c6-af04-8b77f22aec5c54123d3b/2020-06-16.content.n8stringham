<p>WASHINGTON — Stocks sank again on Friday after another wild day, 
extending a rout that left Wall Street with its worst week since October
 2008. However, the market clawed back much of its intraday losses in 
the last 15 minutes of trading. </p>
<p>Bond prices soared as investors sought safety, pushing yields to 
record lows. The stock swoon is being driven by fear that the 
coronavirus outbreak will derail the global economy. </p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 357 points, or 1.4%, to 25,409.
 The S&amp;P 500 lost 24 points, or 0.8%, to 2,954. The benchmark index 
has lost 13% since hitting a record high 10 days ago. The Nasdaq rose 1 
point to 8,567.</p>
<p>The weeklong rout was being driven by fears that the spreading coronavirus will derail the global economy. </p>
<p>The losses moderated somewhat after the Federal Reserve said the 
economy was still strong and that it stood ready to help the economy if 
needed. </p>
<p>The falling numbers come a day after the Dow Jones lost 1,190.95 points -- the second thousand-point drop this week.</p>
<p>As of 1:00 p.m. ET Friday, the S&amp;P 500 index fell 52 points, or 
1.78%, to 2,925. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 681 points, or 
2.6%, to 25,085. The Nasdaq fell 93.8 points, or 1.1%, to 8,472. </p>
<p>All three indices on Friday entered what is called "correction" -- 
meaning they are down 10% or more from their recent highs. While that 
big a drop is scary, corrections are fairly regular occurrences. Some 
traders even see them as healthy, helping to eliminate froth that may 
have built up after a long run higher. But fear is high this correction 
may worsen into a bear market -- a drop of 20%.</p>

<p>Asian markets continued their freefall Friday. Tokyo's benchmark fell
 by 4% and Shanghai, Seoul and Sydney all fell by about 3%. </p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell pledged that the Fed will “use
 our tools" to support the economy, a strong signal of a likely rate 
cut, perhaps at its next meeting March 17-18. </p>
<p>The Fed said Friday that it will “act as appropriate to support the 
economy." The statement came after a week of sharp market drops that 
drove stocks down roughly 13% in value. </p>
<p>Powell said the fundamentals of the U.S. economy “remain strong," but
 added that "the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity.”
 </p>
<p>The deepening global rout is fueled by fears the spreading virus, 
COVID-19, that emerged in China in December will derail global trade and
 other industries. Investors had appeared confident governments were 
bringing the outbreak under control, but forecasters warned such 
optimism likely was premature.</p>
<p>The outbreak has sapped financial markets, emptied shops and 
businesses and put major sites and events off limits. The list of 
countries hit by the illness edged toward 60 on Friday as Mexico, 
Belarus, Lithuania, New Zealand, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Iceland and the 
Netherlands reported their first cases. </p>
<p>The threats to livelihoods were increasingly as worrisome as the 
threats to lives. If the disease becomes a global pandemic, economists 
say the U.S. and other global economies could fall into recession. </p>
<p>A growing list of major companies are issuing profit warnings and say
 factory shutdowns in China are disrupting supply chains. They say 
travel bans and other anti-disease measures also are hurting Chinese 
consumer spending.</p>
