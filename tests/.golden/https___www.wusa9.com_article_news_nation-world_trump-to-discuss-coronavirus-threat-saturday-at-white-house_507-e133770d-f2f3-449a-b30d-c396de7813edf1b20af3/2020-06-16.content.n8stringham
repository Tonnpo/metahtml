<p>WASHINGTON — The first death from the new coronavirus in the United 
States was a man in Washington state, where the governor has declared a 
state of emergency on Saturday.</p>
<p>Officials said the man who died there of COVID-19 was in his 50s and 
had underlying health conditions. More than 50 people in a nursing 
facility are sick and being tested for the virus. A woman in her 40s who
 works at the facility and a resident in her 70s have tested positive 
for the virus. </p>
<p>Officials in California and Oregon are also worried about the novel 
coronavirus spreading through West Coast communities because people are 
being infected by unknown means. </p>
<p>COVID-19 is a member of the coronavirus family and is related to the 
SARS and MERS viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump addressed the nation on Saturday about the 
coronavirus threat, saying the U.S. is “super prepared” for a wider 
coronavirus outbreak and “there’s no reason to panic.” He spoke after 
officials reported the first death from the disease in the U.S. 
Officials say the man had a high medical risk before contracting the 
virus. </p>
<p>Trump and other officials announced the U.S. is banning travel to 
Iran and urging Americans not to travel to regions of Italy and South 
Korea where the virus has been prevalent. Public health officials say 
they mistakenly told Trump and Vice President Mike Pence that the 
patient who died was a woman. </p>

<p>Trump had acknowledged the death in Saturday's press conference 
saying of the patient that she was, "a wonderful woman, a medically high
 risk patient in her 50s."</p>
<p>However, Washington state health officials confirmed later on 
Saturday afternoon that the patient was a man. Seattle and King County 
Public Health Officer Jeff Duchin said during a press phone call led by 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the patient who died
 was a man, not a woman as the president had said earlier.</p>
<p>During his news conference, Trump said that "the White House 
coronavirus taskforce" met for two hours Saturday, and both he and Pence
 attended that meeting.</p>
<p>Trump said 22 people in the U.S. have been stricken by the new 
coronavirus and more cases in the United States are “likely.” He says 
healthy Americans should be able to recover if they contract the new 
virus.</p>

<p>A patient at EvergreenHealth has died from the coronavirus COVID-19. It's the first U.S. death from the virus, Feb. 29, 2020.</p>
<p>Pence said the travel ban placed on Iran will include blocking any 
foreign national who has been there within the last 14 days from going 
to the U.S.</p>
<p>Pence said the federal government is urging Americans not to travel 
to areas of Italy and South Korea worst affected by the coronavirus 
outbreak. The vice president also said they have been working with 3M to
 boost production of face masks. </p>

<p>The coronavirus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. 
Health officials think it spreads mainly from droplets when an infected 
person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads. </p>
<p>The outbreak began in China but has infected tens of thousands of 
people in more than three dozen countries, with the vast majority in 
mainland China. </p></article>
