<p class="rm-manual">A viewer was told that people with the flu can't 
get the new coronavirus. That's not true and could lead people to 
harmful actions.</p>

<p>Viewer Chelsea W. sent us an email with an interesting question:</p>
<p>“A friend said the ER told her if she tested positive for the flu it 
was impossible to have the coronavirus at the same time... that the 2 
viruses can’t be present in a patient at the same time. Is this true?”</p>
<h3>THE QUESTION:</h3>
<p>Is it impossible to get the coronavirus at the same time as the flu?</p>
<h3>THE ANSWER:</h3>
<p>No. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World
 Health Organization said it’s possible to have COVID-19, the sickness 
caused by the coronavirus, and the flu at the same time. They are 
currently researching to see what interactions the viruses might have.</p>

<h3>WHAT WE FOUND:</h3>
<p>A spokesperson for the CDC told VERIFY that, “It is certainly 
possible for someone to have more than one virus or other microbial 
infection at the same time.”</p>
<p>The CDC separately confirmed that it’s possible to have the flu and COVID-19 simultaneously. </p>
<p>So what does this mean for your body? Unfortunately, we don’t know yet. </p>
<p>The WHO said they’re currently researching that exact question.</p>

<p>They want to know how the coronavirus interacts with other viruses or illnesses.</p>
<p>But they can’t say yet if it puts people at more risk or changes symptoms. </p>
<p>Bottom line: Having the flu doesn’t prevent you from getting COVID-19.</p>
<p>And that’s important because this false idea could lead people with 
the flu to think they’re immune or don’t have to take the same 
precautions to avoid COVID-19.</p>
