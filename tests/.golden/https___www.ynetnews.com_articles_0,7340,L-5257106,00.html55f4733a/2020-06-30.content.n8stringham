<h1 class="rm-manual">US makes good on threat, sanctions Iranian Quds Force</h1>
<h2 class="rm-manual">First series of sanctions imposed by US on 6 
people, 3 Iranian companies suspected of funneling funds to 
Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force; 'Iranian regime, its Central 
Bank have abused access to entities in UAE to acquire US dollars to fund
 IRGC-QF's malign activities,' US Sect. of State Mnuchin says.</h2>

<p>The US Treasury imposed sanctions on Thursday against six individuals
 and three companies it said had funneled millions of dollars to the 
Iranian Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force, just days after 
President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5254963,00.html">withdrew</a> from the landmark 2015 Iran <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4679591,00.html">nuclear deal</a>. </p>
<ul> <li class="rm-manual">Follow Ynetnews on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ynetnews/129653250402500?fref=ts">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ynetnews">Twitter</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>The Treasury Department said it was acting with the <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5255954,00.html">United Arab Emirates</a>
 to disrupt the network and accused Iran's central bank of actively 
helping the group to access US dollars held in foreign bank. </p>

<p> "The Iranian regime and its Central Bank have abused access to 
entities in the UAE to acquire US dollars to fund the IRGC-QF's malign 
activities, including to fund and arm its regional proxy groups, by 
concealing the purpose for which the US dollars were acquired," Mnuchin 
said in a statement. </p>

<p>The six individuals and three entities were sanctioned under US 
regulations targeting specially designated global terrorist suspects and
 Iranian financial activity, the Treasury said. The crackdown comes two 
days after Trump withdrew from the 2015 arms accord and as US Secretary 
of State Mike Pompeo pushes allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East 
to pressure Iran to return to negotiations over its nuclear and missile 
programs. Trump's decision has given grace periods of 90 days to six 
months for companies to wind down their trade with Iran. In February 
2015, Reuters reported that at least $1 billion in cash had been 
smuggled into Iran despite US and other sanctions. Before it reached 
Iran, the cash was passed through money changers and front companies in 
Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq, sources told Reuters. The 
report said Iran's central bank had worked with other entities, 
including sanctioned Iranian companies, to find ways to obtain US 
dollars, including using front companies and their networks. They said 
the central bank had given the orders to the front companies abroad to 
buy dollars. </p>

<p> Before the 2015 nuclear deal was reached, front companies had 
mushroomed in Dubai to facilitate payments to Iran. The use of multiple 
front companies, which bought dollars from currency traders in Dubai and
 Iraq, was preferred as it concealed the overall size of the dollar 
purchasing operation. The Islamic republic's official government 
newspaper "Iran" reported Wednesday that officials feared that following
 the US withdrawal and re-imposition of sanctions, contracts signed 
between Iran and Airbus and Boeing aircraft manufacturers will be 
canceled. Thanks to the nuclear deal's relief measures, Iran was able to
 ink a purchasing contract for 100 planes with Airbus worth 19 billion 
dollars, and a similar agreement with Boeing for 110 planes worth 19.6 
billion dollars. President Trump called the nuclear deal "horrible, (a) 
one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made. It didn’t bring 
peace, and it never will." </p>

<p> The president added that the deal, which he said was an 
"embarrassment," might have been renegotiated that same year, but it was
 not. At the heart of the deal, he maintained, was "a giant fiction that
 a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program." "In
 a few moments," Trump continued, "I will sign a presidential memorandum
 to begin reinstating US nuclear sanctions on the Iranian regime. We 
will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. Any nation 
that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly 
sanctioned by the United States." Commenting on the American decision to
 withdraw from the accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5255061,00.html">called</a> the decision "correct, wise and courageous." </p>
<p><span>PM Netanyahu lauded the American decision</span><span> (Photo: EPA)</span></p>
<p> "Had the deal remained in place," Netanyahu continued, "it would 
have allowed Iran to enrich enough uranium within the span of a few 
years to create an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs." "In addition, the 
deal has already funneled Iran billions of dollars to finance its war 
machine throughout the Middle East," the premier added. "That's what it 
does today, when it does not possess a nuclear arsenal, and I ask you to
 consider what it might do when it attains one," he said ominously.</p>
