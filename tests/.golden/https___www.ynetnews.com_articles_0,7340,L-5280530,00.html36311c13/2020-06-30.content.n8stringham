<h2 class="rm-manual">New facility at Natanz's uranium enrichment center
 will allow Tehran to increase its nuclear enrichment capacity, yet stay

 percent.</h2>

<p>TEHRAN - Iran's nuclear chief on Wednesday inaugurated the Islamic 
Republic's new nuclear enrichment facility that is geared toward 
producing centrifuges which will operate within the limits of the 
nuclear deal Tehran signed with world powers.</p>
<ul> <li class="rm-manual">Follow Ynetnews on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ynetnews/129653250402500?fref=ts">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ynetnews">Twitter</a> </li>
</ul>
<p> Iranian state television broadcast an interview with Ali Akbar 
Salehi after nightfall, showcasing the facility at Natanz's uranium 
enrichment center. </p>
<p>In the interview, Salehi said the facility's construction began even 
before the 2015 deal was signed and that he hopes the first 
centrifuges—known as old-generation centrifuges—will roll out in a 
month's time. </p>

<p> In a gesture likely directed at the Trump administration's 
withdrawal from the deal, Iran on Tuesday informed the UN nuclear 
watchdog that it will increase its nuclear enrichment capacity, yet stay
 within the provisions of the accord. The landmark agreement, which 
lifted crippling economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its 
uranium enrichment program, has been facing its greatest diplomatic 
challenges in the wake of President Donald Trump's decision to </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5254963,00.html">pull America out of it</a>.
 European nations and others involved in the accord are now trying to 
salvage it, and many companies that rushed to make billion-dollar deals 
with Iran now are backing out for fear of being targeted by US 
sanctions. Natanz, some 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of the capital,
 Tehran, includes underground facilities protected by some 7.6 meters 
(25 feet) of concrete, which offer protection from airstrikes. Salehi's 
choice of Natanz to offer his speech came as no surprise. The facility 
long has been a point of contention between Iran and the West since its 
public disclosure by an Iranian exile group in 2002. While Tehran long 
has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, Western 
nations have feared Natanz represented a means for Iran to enrich enough
 uranium to produce atomic weapons. </p>

<p> The Stuxnet computer virus, widely believed to be an American and 
Israeli creation, caused thousands of centrifuges at Natanz to spin 
themselves to destruction at the height of the West's fears over Iran's 
program. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran agreed to store its excess 
centrifuges at Natanz under constant surveillance by the UN nuclear 
watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran can use 5,060 
older-model centrifuges at Natanz, but only to enrich uranium up to 3.67
 percent. Natanz was designed to have as many as 50,000 centrifuges 
operating there. In Wednesday's interview, Salehi said mass-production 
for new-generation centrifuges will take years to be fully operational. 
"Every new generation of centrifuges needs eight to 10 years for 
testing," he said. That low-level enrichment means the uranium can be 
used to fuel a civilian reactor but is far below the 90 percent needed 
to produce a weapon. Iran also can possess no more than 300 kilograms 
(660 pounds) of that uranium. That's compared to the 100,000 kilograms 
(220,460 pounds) of higher-enriched uranium it once had. Iran also this 
week told the IAEA it had a "tentative schedule to start production of 
UF6," or uranium hexafluoride. Uranium hexafluoride gas is spun by 
centrifuges to make enriched uranium that can be used in nuclear weapons
 and atomic reactor fuel. That work is also restrained under the nuclear
 deal. Earlier Wednesday, Iranian ambassador to the IAEA Reza Najafi 
told journalists in Vienna that Iran had given European nations "a few 
weeks" to come up with ways to protect the deal from America's pullout. 
"These are the preparatory works for a possible scenario if in an 
unfortunate situation the (nuclear deal) fails then Iran can restart its
 activities without any limits," Najafi said. "What I can say is right 
now, the negotiations at the expert level are continuing and we hope 
that it could reach some conclusion," he added. "Until then, we continue
 to exercise the most restraint but it is not (an) endless process." 
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian warned Iran against 
restarting higher enrichment of uranium. "It is always dangerous to 
flirt with the red lines," he said.</p>
