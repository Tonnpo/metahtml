<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/author/bradley/" rel="author">U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne</a> <span>6 months ago</span> </p>
<h2 class="rm-manual">Byrne: With Soleimani dead, the world is safer</h2>
<p>You may not have known his name, but the most dangerous man in the 
Middle East has finally received justice for a lifetime of brutality.</p>
<p>Before being taken out by an American airstrike, Iranian General 
Qasem Soleimani was a major general in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps and commander of its extra-military, clandestine Quds Force.
 He left his stain on this world by organizing, training and leading 
terrorist groups across the Middle East and beyond.</p>
<p>The blood on his hands included that of at least 600 Americans and thousands more.</p>
<p>Consider the scope of his activities. Soleimani attacked Americans in
 Afghanistan. His forces were active throughout Iraq. He armed Hezbollah
 with rockets that have indiscriminately killed women and children in 
Israel. He attempted attacks in Europe against our allies. He even 
planned at least one failed bombing in our nation’s capital.</p>
<p>To put it simply, he was a terror mastermind. Taking Soleimani off 
the battlefield leaves a gaping hole in the Iranian regime’s ability to 
orchestrate terrorist activities throughout the Middle East. Make no 
mistake, the Middle East, and the entire world, is safer without him.</p>
<p>We can’t be naive. The evil Iranian regime’s goal is to destroy the 
West and its way of life, no matter the cost. Soleimani and the 
government of Iran have never had any intention of adhering to any 
global norms or abiding by any treaties.</p>
<p>That’s why policies of appeasement towards Iran are misguided and 
dangerous. The Obama-era Iranian deal was, at best, an empty public 
relations victory for the Obama administration that did little to slow 
down Iran’s public support for global terrorism and quest towards its 
goal of securing nuclear capabilities. In reality, as we pumped up their
 economy with billions in cash and sanctions relief, Iran never wavered.
 With international scrutiny relaxed, Iran successfully took their 
operations underground. Iran continued and even escalated its proxy 
support of terrorist groups while the Iranian deal was in place. And 
Soleimani was the unquestioned leader.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous President who drew a “red line” regarding Assad’s
 evil Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons, President Trump means 
what he says. He made clear that any Iranian attack on Americans would 
be punished. The killing of Soleimani came just days after his proxies 
attacked our embassy in Baghdad and a military base in Kenya that 
resulted in the loss of an American life.</p>
<p>President Obama may have capitulated in Syria, but global terrorists 
and the regimes who support them now know with certainty that President 
Trump does not make idle threats. He will act decisively to defend 
Americans and our interests around the world. After two face-saving 
attacks from Iran in the region that took no American lives, the Iranian
 regime appears to be wisely deescalating their aggression.</p>
<p>Last week, House Democrats introduced a War Powers Resolution 
designed to discredit President Trump for using his constitutional 
powers to eliminate Soleimani. It is disappointing that when Congress 
should be showing national resolve and unity against an evil Iranian 
regime, Democrats are playing politics. Last week, I received a 
classified briefing from national security officials that made clear the
 continued threat Soleimani posed to Americans. We should be thanking 
the president and the brave men and women who successfully carried out 
this attack, not engaging in political grandstanding.</p>
<p>The evil Iranian regime is growing weaker at home. President Trump’s 
sanctions are continuing to damage Iran’s economy. Iranians are 
protesting in the streets, shouting “death to the dictator!” After 
President Trump’s show of American strength, the Iranian government 
can’t risk further antagonizing the United States. Their leaders would 
be wise to continue their de-escalation.</p>

<h2 class="rm-manual">Auburn College of Veterinary Medicine partners with Humane Genomics Inc. on COVID-19 vaccine development</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">AUBURN, Ala. — Researchers from the Auburn 
University College of Veterinary Medicine are partnering with Humane 
Genomics Inc. to develop a potential vaccine for the COVID-19 virus 
currently at the heart of the ongoing global pandemic.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">According to Dr. Bruce Smith, director of the 
Auburn University Research Initiative in Cancer, professor in the 
Department of Pathobiology and scientist in the college’s Scott-Ritchey 
Research Center, the collaboration between Auburn and Humane Genomics is
 an outgrowth of cooperation between the two in the field of cancer 
research. Much of the science used in this particular vaccine 
development is adapted from the company’s cutting-edge research into 
precision virus-based cancer therapies.</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> 445</p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href=""> <span>Keep reading</span> <span>445 WORDS</span> </a> </p>
<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/auburn-college-of-veterinary-medicine-partners-with-humane-genomics-inc-on-covid-19-vaccine-development/"> <span>Keep reading</span> <span>445 WORDS</span> </a> </p>
<p class="rm-manual">“We had previously worked with Humane Genomics in 
the area of cancer treatment,” said Smith, “specifically an attempt to 
custom synthesize viruses to target tumors. The same basic concept can 
also be used to develop a vaccine. All that is necessary is to have the 
virus’ genome—a genetic map of its DNA—in order to create a vaccine to 
target it.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The COVID-19 genome is available, so the custom 
development of a vaccine tailored to its specific vulnerabilities, a 
so-called “synthetic vectored vaccine,” was a relatively rapid process. 
In this case, that process involved genetically synthesizing via 
computer modeling a harmless virus called vesicular stomatitis virus, or
 VSV, and giving it the same “spike” protein characteristic of COVID-19.
 This spike protein binds with so-called ACE2 receptors on human lung 
cells to allow the harmful virus to infect them. But if the vaccine 
functions as hoped, the immune system would be triggered to produce 
antibodies to recognize this spike protein and block infection, but in a
 harmless virus. That same triggered immune reaction—in theory—would 
then protect against COVID-19.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“The idea of developing vectored vaccines by 
‘cutting and pasting’ virus DNA to alter its characteristics is a proven
 method of vaccine development and has been in use for more than a 
decade,” Smith said. “In the case of animals, vectored vaccines have 
been successfully developed for rabies and fowl pox. In human medicine, a
 vaccine approved in 2019 for the deadly Ebola virus was developed using
 the same technique.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“What makes the Humane Genomics approach unusual,” 
added Smith, “is that they are skipping the traditional cutting and 
pasting process of removing and substituting DNA and instead 
synthesizing their targeted viruses using computer modeling. It allows 
for a much quicker process. If they have the target’s genome, they can 
develop a vaccine in about a week.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">It is the testing phase that takes time, and 
currently the company’s COVID-19 vaccine is in the safety testing phase,
 which is where Auburn’s contribution comes in. The Auburn College of 
Veterinary Medicine is testing the vaccine on rats to see if they 
develop the proper antibodies or become ill due to unforeseen side 
effects. Later, another vaccine partner will perform similar tests with 
guinea pigs, and if all goes well, the vaccine can then move on to human
 testing.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Smith says that, while he is cautiously optimistic a
 working vaccine will eventually be developed, there is still a long 
road ahead despite the urgent need.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“With a tremendous amount of luck, we could have a 
vaccine by the end of the year,” he said, “but more likely, we won’t 
know for sure if a vaccine is going to be successful until some time in 
2021.”</p>

<h2 class="rm-manual">Ala. Dept. of Labor to begin offering extended unemployment benefits to eligible citizens</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">The Alabama Department of Labor announced Monday 
that Alabamians who have exhausted all other unemployment benefits will 
be eligible for the Extended Benefits (EB) program.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">To qualify for the Extended Benefits program an 
individual must have gone through both the normal 14 weeks of 
unemployment provided for by the State of Alabama and the additional 13 
weeks provided by the federal government as part of the CARES Act in 
March.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">All recipients of the EB program in July will be 
paid the extra $600 per week the federal government began attaching to 
unemployment claims as part of the CARES Act; however that additional 
amount is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/the-extra-600-unemployment-benefits-will-end-before-july-31.html">scheduled to cease</a> by July 31.</p>

<p class="rm-manual">The Extended Benefits program is a federal project 
offered only when a state’s insured unemployment rate goes over 5.9%. 
The last time it was offered in Alabama was during the Great Recession 
of 2008.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The 13-week extension of normal unemployment paid 
for by the federal government is called the Federal Pandemic 
Unemployment Compensation program.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">EB will start being available to eligible unemployed Alabamians on July 5.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Once the extra $600 from the federal government 
stops being added the EB program will pay the standard unemployment 
benefit amount for Alabama, which is $275 per week.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Per the Department of Labor, “Claimants must not be
 eligible for unemployment compensation benefits in another state or 
Canada, must have no disqualifications, have qualifying wages, and must 
have at least one week in the benefit year that begins in an EB 
eligibility period.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">ADOL will notify those eligible for EB benefits via
 the online UI Claims Tracker and by mail. Claimants will not have to 
apply for these benefits but should continue to file weekly 
certifications, per the department.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The department added, “Individuals are only 
entitled to benefits if they are no longer working through no fault of 
their own and they MUST be able and available for work. The EB program 
has more stringent work search requirements and requires claimants to 
engage in a ‘systematic and sustained’ effort to obtain work during each
 week and to provide evidence of efforts. Due to the pandemic, the 
submission of required work search contacts has been TEMPORARILY waived 
due to Covid-19 restrictions. However, claimants should continue to look
 for work where possible, and maintain a record of their efforts on a 
weekly basis. This waiver may end at any time. Once this waiver ends, 
claimants will be required to provide a minimum of three (3) work search
 contacts each week during the weekly certification process.”</p>

citizens of Alabaster to the city council. Bedsole has already received 
an endorsement from the Shelby County Fraternal Order of Police in the 
HD 49 race.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“I have spent many successful years with my family 
by my side serving my community and demonstrating the type of leadership
 the people of District 49 will appreciate,” Bedsole stated when 
announcing his candidacy. “I am patient enough to listen to those who 
have something to say, but bold enough to speak up for those who feel 
like they do not have a voice.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“I believe that life starts at conception, that the
 2nd amendment should be protected, that our taxes need to be low and 
fair, and that our cities and counties need their fair share of 
infrastructure support,” he added.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">A release from Bedsole’s campaign advised that he 
“will work to improve District 49’s infrastructure and traffic flow, 
increase economic development, and advance school systems” if elected to
 the House.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">The special primary election will be held on August
 4. If a run-off election is needed, it will be held on September 1. The
 special general election will be held on November 17.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">“I humbly ask for your vote on August 4th to allow me to serve District 49,” Bedsole said.</p>

<h2 class="rm-manual">State Reps. Daniels, Dismukes show some in the Alabama legislature can be open to compromises on Confederate Memorial Park</h2>
<p class="rm-manual">As a movement of racial justice sweeps across the 
nation, the media finds itself distracted by patently absurd issues like
 cartoon voices, 80s TV shows and other trivial issues.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Most people, however, seem interested in hearing 
out the legitimate gripes people may have about depictions of history 
and how power operates in this country.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Riots and protests at unrelated monuments to 
American history (Columbus, Washington, Lincoln and Grant) have the 
potential to derail the movement, as do the equally absurd cries to 
“Defund The Police” — and white liberals’ attempts to explain what that 
“actually” means while those saying it in the Black Lives Matter 
movement are pretty clear.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">In Alabama, with its troubling racial past, there 
are leaders like House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels (D-Huntsville) 
who have laid out a few real changes they would like to see while 
showing an openness to compromise on issues down the road.</p>

<p class="rm-manual"> <a href="https://yellowhammernews.com/state-reps-daniels-dismukes-show-some-in-the-alabama-legislature-can-be-open-to-compromises-on-confederate-memorial-park/"> <span>Keep reading</span> <span>450 WORDS</span> </a> </p>
<p class="rm-manual">First, and reasonably so, Daniels wants the 
Confederate flag removed from Alabama State Trooper uniforms. This is 
such a non-issue, that should be resolved quickly, that State Senator 
Artur Orr (R-Decatur) said during a radio appearance on Friday that he 
didn’t even know they had the Confederate flag on them.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Daniels also wants a monument to the “Confederate 
Cause” that is placed near the steps of the Madison County Courthouse 
removed. This is happening, slowly, but the statue put up in 1905 will 
be moved from the courthouse to the Confederate section of Maple Hill 
Cemetery in Huntsville.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Those issues are almost no-brainers. They may take 
time, but they will probably happen as soon as the slow gears of 
government turn and make it so.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Of the more contentious discussions we will see in 
Alabama over this topic will be the attempted defunding of Confederate 
Memorial Park and the potential end of the Alabama Memorial Preservation
 Act.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Daniels has taken issue with the $600,000 budget 
allotment to this park, and Alabama Democratic Party spokesman Wade 
Perry accused State Rep. Will Dismukes (R-Prattville), who opposes this 
defunding idea, of disloyalty to the United States and called for him to
 resign.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">My take: Perry is a clown. He is just using this to
 get attention, meanwhile the elected leaders are using his outlandish 
behavior to show that they are being more reasonable by contrast. They 
are right.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Daniels believes some local municipalities will 
want to keep their statues local, saying it is “so that they can have 
discussions about history locally.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">But last week, both Daniels and Dismukes appeared 
on WVNN’s “The Dale Jackson Show,” and a compromise may have emerged. 
Both agreed that Confederate Memorial Park could continue to exist, 
potentially as a stopping point for removed monuments, with Daniels 
noting, “I’m not against moving them to the Confederate park, but I 
think that if we’re going to have a park it should talk about all of 
Alabama history park, not just Confederate history. I think that 
Confederate history is certainly a part of Alabama history.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">Daniels called this a “good compromise.”</p>
<p class="rm-manual">With both Dismukes and Daniels, two very different 
leaders from two very different parties, open to the idea of compromise,
 we may be nearing an amicable solution for the continued operation of 
Confederate Memorial Park in some form.</p>
<p class="rm-manual">If Alabama’s leaders could settle this issue and help us all move on, we will all be far better off.</p>
